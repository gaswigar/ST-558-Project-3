the
meeting
when
the
dog
came
to
the
border
of
the
clearing
he
stopped
then
knowing
that
his
back
could
be
seen
over
the
weeds
he
slunk
down
so
that
his
belly
scraped
the
earth
he
was
tense
and
quivering
and
his
eyes
bore
a
haunted
look
but
there
was
nothing
craven
in
them
and
little
fear
in
all
his
life
the
dog
had
never
feared
anything
except
the
terrible
torment
that
beset
him
now
he
was
of
no
recognizable
breed
though
all
of
his
ancestors
had
been
large
dogs
there
was
a
hint
of
staghound
in
his
massive
head
and
in
his
carriage
and
somewhere
along
the
way
he
had
acquired
a
trace
of
great
dane
his
fur
was
silky
like
a
collie
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
bloodhound
in
his
somewhat
flabby
jowls
without
purpose
or
plan
the
blood
of
all
these
breeds
had
mingled
to
produce
this
big
mongrel
he
was
so
emaciated
that
slatted
ribs
showed
even
through
his
fur
had
he
eaten
as
much
as
he
wanted
he
would
have
weighed
about
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
but
he
had
had
so
little
food
recently
that
he
was
fifteen
pounds
lighter
intelligence
glowed
in
his
eyes
but
there
was
also
something
in
them
that
verged
on
desperation
he
moved
only
his
head
and
moved
that
slowly
this
dog
knew
too
much
and
had
suffered
too
much
to
let
himself
be
seen
until
he
had
some
idea
of
what
he
was
about
he
was
looking
toward
a
big
white
farmhouse
that
was
surrounded
by
a
grove
of
apple
trees
a
thin
plume
of
blue
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
and
a
pile
of
wood
lay
in
the
yard
busy
white
hens
wandered
about
white
and
black
cows
and
two
brown
horses
cropped
grass
in
a
pasture
pigs
grunted
in
their
pen
and
a
black
cat
sunned
itself
on
the
door
step
the
dog
attention
returned
to
the
man
who
was
splitting
more
wood
he
was
thin
dressed
in
faded
blue
jeans
and
a
tan
shirt
and
the
blows
of
his
axe
echoed
dully
from
the
hills
surrounding
the
farm
house
he
worked
slowly
and
methodically
the
dog
drank
eagerly
of
his
scent
although
he
did
not
leave
his
cover
for
behind
him
there
was
only
a
trail
of
torment
abuse
and
real
danger
he
had
been
wandering
for
two
months
and
his
path
was
a
long
one
but
because
it
was
also
a
twisted
one
it
had
not
taken
him
too
far
from
the
place
he
had
left
he
had
been
in
villages
and
towns
through
farm
lands
and
forest
and
wherever
he
met
men
he
had
been
stoned
or
clubbed
three
times
twice
by
farmers
and
once
by
a
policeman
he
had
been
shot
at
the
dog
could
not
know
that
this
was
partly
because
of
his
appearance
and
size
he
was
big
and
he
looked
wild
had
he
cared
to
do
so
he
could
have
killed
a
man
but
what
none
of
his
tormentors
could
know
was
that
though
the
dog
feared
little
he
was
almost
incapable
of
attacking
a
human
being
what
nobody
could
know
either
was
that
most
of
all
the
dog
was
in
desperate
need
of
someone
to
love
until
two
months
ago
everything
had
been
different
when
the
dog
came
to
live
with
johnny
blazer
in
the
hills
behind
smithville
he
was
so
young
that
it
always
seemed
he
must
have
begun
life
with
johnny
it
was
a
good
life
and
he
had
never
wanted
any
other
johnny
cabin
was
big
with
a
kitchen
and
combined
room
on
the
first
floor
and
the
entire
second
floor
given
over
to
many
bunks
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
big
cabin
because
in
season
johnny
both
guided
and
boarded
hunters
and
fishermen
during
the
winter
he
trapped
furs
and
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
he
worked
at
odd
jobs
or
searched
out
and
sold
medicinal
roots
which
he
found
in
the
hills
a
lean
woodsman
in
his
late
thirties
johnny
had
been
the
dog
revered
master
because
he
was
a
dog
and
thus
incapable
of
grasping
the
more
complex
facts
the
great
animal
did
not
understand
that
life
was
not
the
wholly
carefree
and
happy
one
it
seemed
he
could
sense
that
johnny
avoided
the
whitneys
who
at
various
places
in
the
hills
lived
much
as
johnny
did
because
they
were
johnny
enemies
it
followed
that
the
whitneys
must
be
the
dog
enemies
too
but
he
had
never
understood
what
took
place
johnny
and
the
dog
were
strolling
toward
smithville
when
a
rifle
cracked
and
johnny
took
three
staggering
steps
to
fall
forward
while
the
dog
hovered
anxiously
near
his
master
tried
and
failed
to
get
up
the
dog
knew
that
the
scent
of
pete
whitney
filled
the
air
but
there
was
no
connection
between
pete
and
the
fact
that
johnny
blazer
lay
wounded
in
the
road
for
an
hour
the
dog
worried
beside
johnny
whining
because
he
could
not
help
then
a
car
happened
along
the
two
men
in
it
lifted
johnny
into
the
car
and
were
off
at
high
speed
the
dog
tried
to
follow
but
though
he
could
run
very
fast
he
could
not
keep
up
with
the
car
outdistanced
he
panted
back
to
the
cabin
because
he
was
sure
that
johnny
would
return
there
too
he
waited
a
week
never
venturing
far
away
and
eating
only
what
he
could
find
or
catch
then
he
set
out
to
look
for
johnny
he
gone
first
to
smithville
and
the
first
person
he
met
there
was
pete
whitney
the
dog
slowed
to
a
walk
watching
pete
warily
and
bristling
he
saw
no
connection
between
any
of
pete
actions
and
johnny
disappearance
but
all
the
whitneys
were
enemies
he
leaped
aside
when
pete
aimed
a
swift
kick
at
his
groin
then
turned
with
bared
fangs
unarmed
pete
shrank
back
against
a
building
and
the
dog
went
on
the
alarm
was
sounded
johnny
blazer
dog
had
come
into
town
and
threatened
a
person
for
a
while
johnny
had
many
friends
in
smithville
nothing
was
done
but
after
two
days
the
dog
was
considered
a
menace
mothers
of
small
children
became
concerned
for
their
safety
the
first
act
of
most
men
upon
seeing
the
dog
was
to
pick
up
and
hurl
any
convenient
missile
the
smithville
constable
bill
ellis
reluctantly
set
out
to
kill
the
animal
but
two
hours
earlier
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
would
not
find
johnny
in
smithville
the
dog
had
left
what
he
could
not
possibly
know
was
that
his
master
was
dead
and
the
official
cause
of
his
death
was
bullet
wound
inflicted
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown
as
the
dog
wandered
hope
faded
he
could
not
find
johnny
but
the
dog
had
to
have
a
master
because
he
was
unable
to
live
without
one
and
now
as
he
lay
in
the
tall
weeds
all
the
deep
yearnings
in
his
heart
concentrated
on
this
man
splitting
wood
he
half
rose
minded
to
walk
out
and
meet
him
but
memory
of
the
rocks
and
clubs
that
had
come
his
way
was
not
an
easy
one
to
banish
and
he
settled
down
in
the
weeds
again
then
an
uncontrollable
longing
for
someone
to
love
and
someone
to
love
him
overcame
everything
else
and
he
left
the
weeds
he
walked
with
his
tail
drooping
in
a
half
circle
down
his
rear
but
he
was
not
abject
because
it
was
not
in
him
to
be
so
one
or
more
of
his
many
ancestors
had
bequeathed
to
him
a
great
pride
and
a
regal
inner
sense
and
though
he
would
run
when
a
club
or
brick
was
hurled
at
him
he
could
never
cringe
he
carried
his
tail
low
because
that
was
the
way
he
carried
it
naturally
like
a
collie
or
staghound
the
man
setting
a
chunk
of
wood
against
the
splitting
block
had
his
back
turned
to
the
dog
and
did
not
at
once
see
him
the
dog
waited
unwilling
to
intrude
until
he
was
invited
to
do
so
the
man
raised
his
axe
brought
it
expertly
down
and
the
wood
split
cleanly
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
two
pieces
and
when
he
did
he
saw
the
dog
you
catching
up
one
of
the
chunks
he
hurled
it
with
deadly
aim
and
intent
but
even
as
he
did
this
the
huge
animal
started
to
run
so
that
instead
of
striking
him
in
the
head
the
chunk
of
wood
struck
his
right
shoulder
the
dog
felt
quick
agony
that
subsided
to
searing
pain
as
he
kept
running
twenty
seconds
later
he
heard
a
rifle
blast
and
the
thump
of
a
leaden
slug
that
plowed
into
the
earth
six
inches
to
one
side
the
rifle
roared
a
second
time
and
a
third
then
he
was
safe
in
the
woods
he
slowed
to
a
walk
knowing
that
he
could
not
be
seen
now
and
his
nose
informed
him
that
there
were
no
other
men
around
for
the
time
being
he
was
in
no
danger
but
he
was
heartsick
again
he
had
tried
in
every
way
he
knew
to
find
someone
whom
he
might
love
and
who
in
turn
might
love
him
once
more
his
overtures
had
brought
him
only
hurt
the
dog
could
not
know
that
the
farmer
seeing
him
suddenly
had
been
too
startled
to
think
when
he
was
finally
capable
of
coherent
thought
he
decided
that
a
wild
dangerous
and
doubtless
rabid
wolf
had
emerged
from
the
forest
and
that
its
only
intention
could
be
to
prey
upon
the
locality
flocks
and
herds
failing
to
bring
it
down
with
his
rifle
the
farmer
got
hastily
on
the
phone
to
mobilize
his
neighbors
within
half
an
hour
a
posse
was
out
however
its
members
were
farmers
and
not
hunters
the
only
hunting
dogs
in
the
area
were
a
few
fox
and
coon
hounds
and
some
rabbit
hounds
and
they
refused
to
interest
themselves
in
the
supposed
wolf
trail
but
there
was
also
a
pair
of
big
brindle
bulls
and
they
were
urged
into
the
woods
an
hour
later
the
dog
met
this
pair
coursing
a
little
open
glade
they
appeared
in
front
of
him
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
they
stopped
the
bulls
weighed
only
about
fifty
pounds
each
but
they
had
had
many
battles
and
they
knew
how
to
fight
lifting
their
lips
in
anticipatory
grins
they
closed
in
the
dog
waited
anger
rising
in
his
heart
he
too
knew
how
to
fight
for
the
barest
fraction
of
a
minute
he
gauged
the
bulls
advance
then
he
attacked
he
was
not
as
swift
as
he
ordinarily
was
because
he
had
not
eaten
enough
but
with
his
staghound
and
collie
lineage
he
had
inherited
all
the
fluid
rippling
grace
of
such
dogs
it
was
not
his
way
to
bore
in
to
seek
a
hold
and
keep
it
but
to
slash
and
slice
he
struck
the
first
bull
cut
it
to
the
shoulder
bone
and
leaped
clear
over
his
enemy
before
there
could
be
a
return
thrust
he
whirled
to
face
the
second
it
came
at
him
with
a
short
choppy
gait
eyes
half
closed
and
mouth
open
as
it
sought
any
hold
at
all
as
soon
as
it
was
able
to
get
one
it
would
clamp
its
jaws
and
grind
until
the
piece
of
flesh
in
its
mouth
was
torn
out
then
it
would
get
another
hold
and
another
and
literally
tear
its
enemy
apart
the
dog
waited
as
though
he
were
about
to
meet
the
bull
head
on
but
when
only
inches
separated
them
he
glided
to
one
side
ducked
to
get
hold
of
a
front
leg
and
used
all
his
strength
to
throw
the
bull
clear
over
his
head
he
turned
to
meet
the
second
bull
that
recovering
had
come
in
to
grab
his
thigh
twisting
himself
almost
double
the
dog
slashed
and
bit
and
each
time
he
slashed
fresh
blood
spurted
from
the
brindle
bull
hide
the
dog
opened
his
huge
mouth
clamped
it
over
the
bull
neck
and
shook
his
adversary
back
and
forth
the
bulls
had
courage
but
they
were
and
not
the
fighting
bulls
that
will
gladly
die
if
they
can
take
their
enemy
with
them
they
staggered
twenty
feet
off
and
faced
the
dog
warily
as
though
seeking
some
new
way
to
attack
him
he
waited
ready
for
whatever
they
might
do
and
when
he
finally
limped
away
he
did
so
with
his
head
turned
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
he
was
not
afraid
to
renew
the
battle
but
he
wanted
most
to
be
let
alone
by
this
ugly
pair
in
spite
of
all
the
rebuffs
and
even
physical
violence
that
he
had
met
up
with
however
he
could
not
abandon
the
driving
urge
that
had
sent
him
forth
he
could
not
live
without
a
master
somewhere
and
somehow
he
must
find
one
he
passed
from
settled
country
into
forest
where
there
was
only
an
occasional
clearing
when
two
deer
fled
before
him
he
gave
halfhearted
chase
but
his
shoulder
still
hurt
and
the
battle
had
wearied
him
when
the
deer
outdistanced
him
he
stopped
to
eat
a
few
mushrooms
that
grew
on
a
stump
they
were
tasteless
fare
but
they
helped
still
the
gnawing
in
his
belly
near
the
edge
of
a
pond
he
found
and
ate
a
fish
that
had
been
hurt
in
battle
with
a
bigger
fish
and
after
that
he
caught
a
mouse
all
together
were
mere
tidbits
and
the
dog
thought
wistfully
of
the
delicious
meals
johnny
blazer
used
to
prepare
for
him
night
had
fallen
when
he
stopped
suddenly
his
nose
tickled
by
the
tantalizing
odor
of
food
mingled
with
it
was
the
smell
of
wood
smoke
and
a
man
the
dog
nose
informed
him
that
there
was
a
creek
and
he
caught
the
smell
of
cinders
and
steel
that
meant
a
railroad
the
dog
slowed
to
a
walk
and
went
closer
to
verify
with
his
eyes
what
his
nose
had
already
told
him
there
was
a
creek
spanned
by
a
railroad
bridge
beneath
the
bridge
was
a
small
bright
fire
over
which
on
a
forked
stick
hung
a
pot
of
simmering
coffee
crouched
beside
the
fire
was
a
man
and
because
there
is
a
difference
in
the
odors
of
young
and
old
the
dog
knew
that
this
was
a
young
man
the
dog
padded
silently
through
tall
wild
grass
growing
beside
the
creek
he
drooled
at
the
odor
of
food
but
because
painful
experience
had
taught
him
to
be
very
careful
in
all
dealings
with
men
he
did
not
go
any
nearer
he
licked
his
chops
with
a
moist
tongue
and
excitement
danced
in
his
eyes
how
he
would
love
to
be
near
that
fire
partaking
of
the
food
and
the
caresses
of
the
young
man
but
he
had
better
be
careful
at
the
same
time
that
the
dog
met
the
farmer
who
hurled
the
block
of
wood
at
him
jeff
tarrant
was
walking
down
a
dusty
road
that
led
into
the
town
of
cressman
two
days
past
his
eighteenth
birthday
his
face
betrayed
his
youth
healthy
as
sunshine
he
walked
with
a
spring
in
his
step
and
his
head
held
high
his
rather
loose
lips
formed
a
grin
that
seemed
permanently
fixed
his
blue
eyes
sparked
and
a
shock
of
curly
red
hair
that
needed
cutting
tumbled
on
his
head
even
if
it
were
not
for
the
pack
he
carried
he
would
have
commanded
a
second
glance
the
pack
made
of
both
canvas
and
leather
and
with
straps
at
strategic
intervals
was
huge
it
began
at
jeff
hip
line
extended
two
inches
over
the
top
of
his
head
and
it
was
bulging
across
it
in
black
letters
as
big
as
the
pack
would
accommodate
was
tarrant
enterprises
jeff
himself
had
designed
the
pack
to
fit
his
needs
and
he
had
done
the
lettering
it
described
him
perfectly
for
what
nobody
except
jeff
knew
was
that
tarrant
enterprises
was
limited
to
whatever
might
be
in
the
pack
he
walked
cheerfully
for
it
was
a
cheerful
day
and
he
gave
thanks
for
the
country
and
the
road
on
which
he
found
himself
in
the
first
place
this
was
the
only
kind
of
country
in
which
tarrant
enterprises
could
flourish
secondly
the
day
was
made
for
walking
when
jeff
found
himself
on
traveled
roads
he
was
forever
being
offered
rides
and
for
the
sake
of
both
courtesy
and
good
business
he
always
accepted
but
there
had
been
no
rides
today
descending
a
hill
jeff
looked
down
at
a
junction
of
two
forested
valleys
up
one
of
which
a
train
was
puffing
he
looked
at
it
closely
while
the
smile
in
his
eyes
and
that
on
his
mouth
seemed
to
grow
a
little
more
pronounced
railroad
tracks
meant
towns
somewhere
and
the
sort
of
business
tarrant
enterprises
could
do
in
towns
depended
on
circumstance
jeff
sniffed
deeply
for
part
of
his
success
depended
on
an
ability
to
sense
what
lay
ahead
just
as
a
hunter
must
sense
what
is
in
the
offing
now
he
had
wood
smoke
in
his
nostrils
and
he
was
not
surprised
when
he
rounded
an
outjutting
corner
of
the
hill
and
saw
a
farm
house
jeff
whistled
happily
as
he
approached
the
house
and
knocked
on
the
front
door
and
he
had
the
most
gracious
smile
tarrant
enterprises
could
muster
up
for
the
woman
who
opened
it
good
afternoon
i
represent
tarrant
do
want
nothin
she
rasped
never
buy
nothin
from
peddlers
hard
work
loneliness
and
collapsed
dreams
had
all
left
their
marks
so
that
she
was
almost
as
as
the
house
but
jeff
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
place
was
neat
and
clean
and
since
she
did
not
close
the
door
he
entered
swung
the
pack
from
his
back
and
laid
it
on
a
table
get
it
off
she
scolded
do
want
no
dirty
pack
on
my
table
want
nothin
from
no
peddler
nohow
jeff
sniffed
hungrily
a
delicious
incense
the
mingled
odors
of
roast
chicken
and
bread
blessed
his
nostrils
he
said
slowly
and
with
dignity
i
am
not
a
peddler
i
represent
tarrant
now
look
i
just
broke
my
parin
knife
an
i
got
no
time
ah
like
magic
and
seemingly
without
visible
motion
the
pack
opened
from
it
jeff
took
a
paring
knife
with
a
gleaming
blade
and
a
shiny
black
handle
only
seventeen
cents
blade
of
finest
steel
and
hilt
of
genuine
polished
wood
holds
its
edges
and
its
temper
too
a
lifetime
knife
she
looked
at
the
knife
longing
in
her
eyes
when
she
glanced
again
at
jeff
she
was
not
so
hostile
got
no
money
she
admitted
jeff
laughed
i
asked
for
none
our
conversation
became
so
fascinating
that
i
had
no
chance
to
explain
that
i
represent
tarrant
enterprises
we
have
long
recognized
the
needs
of
people
such
as
yourself
people
who
prefer
the
refined
quiet
of
country
life
to
crowds
and
cities
but
country
life
as
you
must
know
is
not
without
inconveniences
our
only
aim
is
to
bring
to
the
doors
of
people
such
as
yourself
whatever
may
not
be
available
her
eyes
were
suspicious
you
mean
you
givin
me
this
knife
not
at
all
tarrant
enterprises
is
always
willing
to
barter
is
that
roast
chicken
i
smell
i
ai
tradin
you
no
roast
chicken
for
no
little
knife
surely
one
small
knife
will
not
fill
your
needs
well
i
could
use
some
cinnamon
sticks
with
the
same
magical
ease
jeff
opened
his
pack
and
gracefully
offered
a
small
parcel
of
cinnamon
sticks
cinnamon
from
ceylon
he
said
at
the
same
time
wondering
if
he
did
not
have
cinnamon
and
tea
confused
he
went
on
the
world
only
pure
cinnamon
made
available
to
tarrant
enterprises
through
special
sources
my
she
was
impressed
what
else
do
you
have
jeff
said
in
the
same
tone
that
a
department
store
manager
would
have
used
what
do
you
wish
she
eyed
the
pack
you
would
have
some
real
nice
gingham
certainly
again
it
was
as
though
the
pack
opened
itself
and
from
it
jeff
took
a
partial
bolt
of
gingham
her
eyes
softened
it
real
pretty
feel
its
texture
jeff
urged
tarrant
enterprises
stocks
only
the
best
shall
we
say
about
six
yards
she
said
doubtfully
best
make
it
three
jeff
whipped
a
pair
of
scissors
from
his
pack
and
a
folding
ruler
from
his
pocket
he
measured
and
cut
three
yards
of
gingham
she
fondled
it
dreamily
and
compared
to
the
dress
she
wore
it
was
elegance
itself
jeff
stood
expectantly
as
though
everything
in
the
world
were
available
in
his
pack
anything
else
she
eyed
the
scissors
can
i
have
them
too
jeff
frowned
slightly
i
do
know
they
sell
for
a
dollar
and
ten
cents
and
tarrant
enterprises
must
show
a
reasonable
return
now
she
said
as
though
suddenly
remembering
i
got
a
dollar
and
for
the
rest
might
we
have
bread
and
chicken
oh
sure
i
get
it
right
now
she
ran
into
the
kitchen
lingered
a
few
minutes
and
returned
with
a
large
package
one
almost
as
large
and
a
small
parcel
jeff
smacked
his
lips
the
largest
package
could
contain
nothing
less
than
the
better
part
of
a
roast
chicken
the
one
nearly
as
large
must
be
a
whole
loaf
of
bread
and
she
pressed
all
three
on
him
some
butter
for
your
bread
an
here
the
dollar
you
comin
through
again
when
i
do
you
have
an
honored
place
on
my
list
of
valued
customers
then
you
will
stop
most
certainly
be
sure
now
you
have
the
word
of
tarrant
enterprises
jeff
strode
happily
down
the
road
and
he
had
cheated
his
customer
in
no
way
tarrant
enterprises
was
always
ready
to
barter
for
jeff
had
long
since
learned
that
money
must
be
spent
now
he
had
a
meal
as
good
as
any
the
best
inns
served
and
he
had
it
for
half
of
what
he
would
have
paid
in
cash
but
the
woman
was
happy
too
and
that
always
made
for
a
fair
deal
when
he
came
to
where
the
two
valleys
made
one
jeff
left
the
road
and
sought
the
railroad
tracks
last
night
he
had
slept
in
a
haystack
but
it
was
far
from
an
ideal
bed
jeff
had
not
resented
the
mice
for
he
thought
mice
were
interesting
the
hay
itself
had
been
old
filled
with
seeds
and
thistles
and
tonight
he
wanted
a
better
camp
it
was
always
possible
to
find
one
along
a
railroad
as
it
always
did
when
he
sighted
potential
customers
jeff
interest
quickened
when
he
saw
two
men
with
a
handcar
beside
them
working
on
the
tracks
he
came
abreast
of
them
two
sweating
bewhiskered
men
who
even
on
this
bright
day
managed
to
look
sullen
good
afternoon
gentlemen
they
glowered
at
him
from
beneath
bushy
eyebrows
and
looked
meaningly
at
each
other
beat
it
peddler
jeff
laughed
merrily
what
a
refreshing
sense
of
humor
such
an
intelligent
bit
of
wisdom
you
are
just
the
men
i
hoped
to
meet
i
represent
tarrant
beat
it
peddler
now
just
think
about
that
reconsider
if
the
two
raised
threatening
pick
axes
are
you
deef
i
was
just
going
jeff
said
hastily
he
was
not
so
much
as
a
trifle
saddened
as
he
trudged
on
down
the
tracks
even
tarrant
enterprises
could
not
overcome
sales
resistance
that
was
backed
by
threatening
pick
axes
and
nobody
won
every
time
nobody
had
to
for
just
down
the
road
there
were
sure
to
be
new
customers
jeff
came
to
a
steel
railroad
bridge
and
looked
with
delighted
eyes
at
the
creek
flowing
beneath
it
it
was
a
clear
stream
and
it
purled
down
riffles
that
filled
a
deep
pool
beneath
the
bridge
there
were
weeds
sand
some
big
rocks
and
driftwood
scrambling
down
the
embankment
jeff
sighed
at
the
sheer
luxury
of
such
a
place
it
had
everything
anyone
needed
carefully
he
laid
the
pack
down
put
his
food
parcels
in
the
shade
and
from
his
own
personal
compartment
of
the
pack
he
took
a
towel
a
wash
cloth
a
bar
of
soap
a
tooth
brush
and
a
comb
taking
off
his
clothes
he
plunged
into
the
pool
and
swam
across
after
five
minutes
he
waded
out
soaped
himself
from
head
to
foot
and
rinsed
in
the
pool
he
was
thus
engaged
when
the
handcar
rattled
over
the
bridge
jeff
dried
himself
dressed
and
combed
some
order
into
the
chaos
of
his
hair
for
a
while
he
was
satisfied
to
lay
in
the
sun
happy
just
to
dream
left
without
parents
when
a
young
child
he
had
been
brought
up
in
an
orphanage
which
he
had
voluntarily
left
when
he
was
fourteen
and
a
half
he
had
worked
for
a
farmer
for
a
livery
stable
which
was
in
the
process
of
becoming
converted
to
a
garage
for
a
pipe
line
crew
and
for
others
long
enough
to
convince
himself
that
there
is
no
special
virtue
in
and
not
much
to
be
gained
through
hard
work
alone
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
he
had
been
owner
manager
and
entire
working
force
of
tarrant
enterprises
that
by
train
car
horse
conveyance
and
on
foot
had
taken
him
to
both
coasts
and
both
borders
he
spent
his
summers
in
the
north
and
his
winters
in
the
south
and
the
tidy
roll
of
bills
sewed
in
an
inside
pocket
was
proof
that
hard
work
is
fine
and
wonderful
if
combined
with
initiative
and
intelligence
it
was
a
happy
life
one
he
liked
and
though
he
thought
he
might
take
roots
some
time
he
was
not
ready
to
do
it
yet
not
until
dusk
brought
the
first
hint
of
evening
chill
did
jeff
gather
wood
and
build
a
fire
he
built
it
close
enough
to
a
big
boulder
so
that
the
rock
surface
would
reflect
heat
but
far
enough
away
so
that
it
would
not
be
too
hot
he
lingered
beside
the
pool
listening
to
the
night
noises
out
in
the
forest
a
whippoorwill
began
its
eerie
cry
and
a
sleepy
bird
twittered
from
its
roost
the
purling
riffles
splashed
and
called
and
a
breeze
set
the
forest
to
sighing
only
a
stone
rolling
down
the
embankment
seemed
to
be
out
of
tune
jeff
fire
cast
weird
shadows
and
the
snapping
of
the
burning
wood
added
its
own
notes
to
the
symphony
of
night
jeff
turned
from
the
stream
toward
his
fire
and
confronted
the
two
men
whom
he
had
met
along
the
railroad
now
he
knew
why
that
stone
had
rolled
except
for
this
one
small
sound
they
had
come
silently
and
in
the
firelight
they
seemed
even
more
unkempt
than
they
had
appeared
in
the
full
light
of
day
they
were
big
men
all
muscle
and
they
carried
pick
handles
in
their
brawny
fists
jeff
felt
a
cold
chill
ripple
down
his
spine
for
it
looked
as
though
the
least
tarrant
enterprises
was
about
to
lose
was
its
entire
capital
stock
he
tried
to
take
command
of
the
situation
good
evening
gentlemen
i
thought
you
be
back
i
was
sure
you
are
an
intelligent
one
of
the
men
said
take
him
buff
the
two
parted
to
come
at
jeff
from
both
sides
he
looked
longingly
at
a
club
lying
near
the
fire
and
as
though
he
had
read
jeff
mind
the
man
called
buff
stood
on
the
club
jeff
backed
slowly
toward
the
water
he
might
lose
the
pack
but
he
intended
to
keep
his
money
and
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
anyone
work
him
over
with
a
pick
handle
as
he
retreated
he
felt
with
his
feet
for
rocks
clubs
anything
at
all
with
which
to
fight
back
the
two
men
advanced
slowly
and
jeff
risked
a
backward
glance
to
see
himself
within
three
paces
of
the
water
there
was
only
sand
beneath
his
feet
at
exactly
that
moment
the
dog
appeared
he
came
slowly
with
dignity
but
uncertainly
because
he
was
not
sure
of
a
welcome
neither
was
he
able
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
for
more
than
a
half
hour
he
had
hidden
in
the
grass
studying
and
entranced
by
jeff
now
he
had
to
find
out
whether
he
was
acceptable
he
halted
four
feet
away
not
caring
to
go
any
closer
until
he
was
sure
seeing
him
jeff
saw
his
own
salvation
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
said
well
where
have
you
been
keeping
yourself
the
dog
sighed
ecstatically
for
so
very
long
he
had
sought
someone
and
now
at
last
he
had
found
him
he
came
forward
to
brush
his
shaggy
back
against
jeff
thighs
and
he
looked
up
at
the
two
men
huge
a
wild
and
thing
even
in
the
full
light
of
day
he
was
even
more
so
by
the
fire
dancing
glow
his
eyes
sparked
his
pendulous
jowls
seemed
taut
and
strained
and
though
he
regarded
the
two
men
with
suspicion
only
neither
could
know
that
they
backed
jeff
patted
the
big
dog
head
and
said
amiably
just
my
dog
just
my
little
old
dog
i
need
some
help
while
i
attend
to
the
business
of
tarrant
enterprises
his
tone
became
slightly
reproachful
and
he
said
to
the
dog
here
here
do
bite
them
now
the
two
men
scrambled
up
the
embankment
and
disappeared
bad
luck
where
it
flowed
into
the
pool
beneath
the
bridge
the
creek
made
rippling
little
noises
a
swimming
muskrat
going
upstream
and
suddenly
seeing
the
fire
and
the
two
beside
it
splashed
as
he
dived
from
somewhere
up
in
the
forested
hills
there
floated
an
owl
mournful
cry
over
all
murmured
a
caressing
little
breeze
which
while
still
soft
with
summer
gentleness
had
within
it
a
foretaste
of
autumn
cold
shaken
jeff
stood
a
moment
it
was
not
the
first
time
anyone
had
tried
to
his
pack
away
from
him
but
it
was
the
closest
anyone
had
ever
come
to
succeeding
his
fright
ebbed
away
tarrant
enterprises
had
led
him
into
other
unusual
situations
and
doubtless
would
lead
into
more
he
turned
to
the
dog
welcome
pal
he
said
grandly
from
now
to
forever
you
may
share
the
fortunes
of
tarrant
enterprises
but
what
the
dickens
sent
you
at
exactly
the
right
time
the
dog
quivered
with
delight
he
had
wandered
for
so
long
his
only
aim
to
find
someone
who
would
be
glad
of
his
company
and
at
last
his
goal
was
reached
he
wagged
a
happy
tail
and
licked
jeff
hand
with
the
tip
of
a
moist
warm
tongue
though
he
would
never
cringe
the
dog
would
appease
and
now
that
he
had
found
someone
in
order
to
stay
near
he
would
appease
any
way
he
could
jeff
exploring
hand
found
the
matted
head
and
ears
and
a
puzzled
frown
wrinkled
his
forehead
whoever
you
belong
to
has
been
taking
very
good
care
of
you
he
murmured
have
you
ever
been
brushed
his
hands
dropped
farther
to
the
dog
sides
and
when
he
touched
the
right
front
shoulder
the
great
animal
winced
and
brought
his
head
quickly
around
jeff
had
found
the
place
which
the
chunk
of
wood
had
struck
and
that
was
painful
but
the
dog
did
not
bare
his
teeth
or
growl
jeff
took
his
hands
away
you
been
hurt
pal
he
said
understandingly
here
let
me
feel
it
once
more
very
gently
pressing
no
harder
than
was
necessary
he
went
over
the
right
shoulder
again
he
could
feel
no
broken
bones
but
just
beneath
the
skin
was
a
mass
of
congealed
blood
and
when
jeff
brought
his
hand
away
his
fingers
were
sticky
with
blood
next
he
found
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
brindle
bull
and
as
he
continued
to
explore
his
puzzlement
increased
the
dog
wore
a
round
leather
collar
that
formerly
might
have
fitted
well
but
because
he
was
thin
it
now
hung
loosely
there
was
no
license
or
identifying
tag
starved
to
gauntness
obviously
the
animal
had
been
receiving
neither
food
nor
attention
his
long
fur
was
matted
and
there
were
so
many
burrs
of
various
kinds
entangled
in
it
that
there
was
almost
no
hope
of
grooming
him
properly
the
conviction
grew
upon
jeff
that
this
dog
was
a
stray
and
that
he
had
come
to
the
fire
because
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
either
he
lost
his
master
or
the
master
had
lost
him
and
in
either
event
he
was
homeless
jeff
frowned
the
whole
success
of
tarrant
enterprises
hinged
on
its
being
entirely
footloose
there
were
places
to
go
and
often
it
was
essential
to
go
there
in
somewhat
of
a
hurry
obviously
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
a
dog
this
size
on
a
train
and
certainly
nobody
with
any
sort
of
vehicle
would
be
inclined
to
pick
him
up
jeff
said
why
the
dickens
could
you
have
been
one
of
those
dogs
that
i
might
have
tucked
in
my
pocket
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
and
looked
at
this
friendly
human
with
happy
eyes
jeff
rubbed
his
huge
head
and
tried
to
think
a
way
out
of
his
dilemma
surely
the
big
fellow
had
no
home
and
was
loose
on
the
countryside
familiar
with
stray
dogs
jeff
knew
that
just
one
fate
awaited
them
sooner
or
later
but
surely
they
were
killed
ordinarily
the
young
trader
would
have
confined
himself
to
pity
but
this
dog
had
helped
him
when
he
was
in
desperate
need
of
help
he
must
not
be
abandoned
now
perhaps
jeff
thought
he
could
find
a
family
that
would
give
the
dog
a
home
but
he
abandoned
the
notion
almost
as
soon
as
it
glimmered
how
many
families
wanted
a
dog
half
the
size
of
a
shetland
pony
maybe
he
could
pay
someone
to
take
care
of
him
but
how
could
he
be
sure
that
the
dog
would
be
cared
for
and
not
abused
there
was
no
way
to
check
six
weeks
from
now
depending
on
where
tarrant
enterprises
led
him
jeff
might
be
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
miles
away
he
did
not
know
when
if
ever
he
would
come
back
the
happy
thought
that
first
things
must
be
first
occurred
to
him
while
the
dog
looked
gravely
on
he
tilted
his
bubbling
coffee
away
from
the
fire
and
unwrapped
the
chicken
the
dog
licked
his
lips
and
riveted
his
gaze
on
the
fowl
jeff
grinned
he
been
told
that
dogs
should
not
have
chicken
bones
but
unless
they
were
always
tied
or
penned
sooner
or
later
most
dogs
found
and
ate
them
at
any
rate
the
dog
had
to
eat
and
there
was
anything
except
chicken
bread
and
butter
jeff
sliced
both
legs
from
the
chicken
and
ordered
sit
the
dog
sat
obviously
he
had
had
training
when
jeff
extended
a
chicken
leg
the
dog
took
it
from
him
so
gently
that
only
his
lips
touched
jeff
hand
but
when
he
had
the
leg
in
his
mouth
he
tore
all
the
meat
from
it
with
one
turn
of
his
jaws
then
he
ground
the
bone
to
bits
and
swallowed
that
too
jeff
looked
at
the
two
bites
he
had
taken
from
his
own
drumstick
hey
he
protested
just
because
you
company
you
do
have
to
gobble
everything
in
sight
he
looked
determinedly
away
and
took
another
bite
of
chicken
but
he
felt
the
dog
appealing
eyes
on
him
and
turned
back
again
if
you
could
talk
he
said
resignedly
you
could
be
sales
manager
for
tarrant
enterprises
you
certainly
know
how
to
sell
yourself
jeff
cut
a
wing
gave
it
to
the
dog
and
watched
in
fascination
while
it
went
the
way
of
and
as
fast
as
the
chicken
leg
he
cut
the
loaf
of
bread
into
six
thick
slices
spread
an
equal
amount
of
butter
on
each
and
saw
the
dog
gulp
five
of
them
jeff
ate
as
rapidly
as
he
could
if
he
was
going
to
get
anything
he
had
to
get
it
fast
he
watched
while
the
dog
ate
all
the
rest
of
the
chicken
and
cleaned
and
swallowed
the
splintered
bones
if
you
going
to
be
a
partner
he
observed
you
better
learn
to
pay
your
own
way
i
go
broke
just
feeding
you
oh
well
we
can
always
have
nice
fresh
air
for
breakfast
now
i
going
to
work
on
you
pal
you
do
look
sort
of
wild
and
woolly
and
it
might
help
both
of
us
stay
out
of
trouble
if
you
did
down
the
dog
lay
down
eyes
glowing
happily
and
jeff
used
gentle
fingers
to
untangle
his
fur
where
it
was
matted
too
tightly
he
cut
it
off
with
a
pair
of
scissors
separating
a
hair
at
a
time
and
using
as
little
pressure
as
possible
he
worked
on
the
injured
right
side
then
he
took
a
brush
from
his
pack
and
brushed
the
dog
smooth
when
he
was
finished
the
animal
still
looked
huge
his
eyes
sparked
in
the
firelight
and
his
flabby
jaws
loaned
him
an
air
of
grimness
but
his
coat
was
no
longer
tangled
or
he
looked
forbidding
enough
so
that
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
the
two
track
workers
seeing
him
and
thinking
he
was
jeff
had
decided
to
run
even
though
they
were
armed
with
pick
handles
anyone
at
all
might
well
hesitate
to
make
rash
moves
around
this
mammoth
creature
now
we
have
to
get
wood
pal
jeff
told
his
new
friend
the
nights
in
mountain
country
are
apt
to
be
on
the
cool
side
he
cast
around
for
driftwood
that
the
creek
had
thrown
onto
its
banks
and
when
he
had
an
armful
he
dumped
it
near
the
fire
always
the
dog
padded
beside
or
behind
him
as
though
fearful
he
would
lose
this
kind
master
should
he
wander
more
than
a
foot
from
him
jeff
threw
some
wood
on
the
fire
and
a
shower
of
sparks
floated
into
the
air
the
dog
curled
contentedly
near
when
he
lay
down
with
his
back
against
the
boulder
jeff
awakened
at
periodic
intervals
to
throw
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
in
the
misty
gray
of
early
morning
he
was
aroused
by
the
unmistakable
sound
of
a
freight
train
making
up
he
listened
intently
it
paid
to
understand
freight
trains
he
had
known
how
far
off
cressman
was
but
he
knew
now
judging
by
the
sound
of
the
freight
train
the
railroad
yards
must
be
in
cressman
it
was
about
one
mile
or
twenty
minutes
walk
away
without
getting
up
the
dog
bared
his
gleaming
fangs
in
a
cavernous
yawn
he
rose
stretched
came
to
jeff
for
a
morning
caress
and
drank
from
the
creek
jeff
looked
admiringly
at
him
the
dog
was
one
of
the
biggest
he
ever
seen
but
he
moved
with
all
the
grace
of
a
much
smaller
animal
jeff
dipped
water
prodded
his
fire
and
put
fresh
coffee
on
to
brew
the
dog
looked
expectantly
at
him
you
ate
it
all
last
night
jeff
explained
there
is
a
thing
left
unless
maybe
you
like
coffee
the
dog
sniffed
about
to
lick
up
splinters
of
bone
and
jeff
looked
at
his
big
pocket
watch
he
lay
back
against
the
boulder
pillowing
his
head
on
his
hands
and
blinking
into
the
rising
sun
quarter
to
six
he
told
his
companion
and
we
have
to
time
our
arrival
in
this
metropolis
almost
to
the
minute
time
waits
for
no
man
but
we
wait
for
time
the
freight
labored
toward
them
rumbled
over
the
bridge
and
sent
a
shower
of
dust
and
cinder
particles
down
sitting
a
little
ways
from
the
fire
the
dog
did
not
even
look
up
jeff
poured
a
cup
of
black
coffee
sipped
it
and
the
dog
licked
his
chops
he
was
not
as
hungry
as
he
had
been
for
last
night
meal
was
a
satisfying
one
but
he
had
been
so
long
without
food
that
he
would
have
eaten
had
there
been
anything
to
eat
jeff
still
lolled
idly
against
the
boulder
dogs
were
welcome
in
some
towns
and
unwelcome
in
others
and
jeff
had
never
been
to
cressman
but
it
was
a
county
seat
there
was
sure
to
be
a
court
house
and
court
houses
opened
at
nine
sharp
jeff
wanted
to
be
there
at
that
time
but
not
before
if
the
dog
had
a
license
even
though
some
might
protest
his
presence
they
could
do
nothing
about
it
as
long
as
he
was
accompanied
by
jeff
finishing
his
coffee
jeff
poured
another
cupful
drank
it
and
dozed
for
a
while
though
he
had
had
a
long
rest
it
was
well
to
sleep
while
he
could
often
tarrant
enterprises
walked
into
a
situation
where
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
rest
at
exactly
twenty
minutes
to
nine
with
the
dog
beside
him
jeff
started
down
the
tracks
cressman
he
saw
when
he
entered
its
outskirts
was
a
town
and
typical
neat
white
houses
framed
both
sides
of
the
street
the
business
section
would
be
farther
on
and
naturally
the
large
building
with
a
flag
pole
on
top
would
be
the
court
house
jeff
walked
swiftly
paying
no
attention
to
the
stares
directed
at
him
he
had
expected
the
dog
to
arouse
notice
the
clock
over
its
entrance
pointed
to
nine
when
he
reached
the
court
house
the
dog
close
beside
him
jeff
entered
and
turned
down
a
corridor
where
a
black
sign
indicated
that
licenses
might
be
had
he
paused
beside
a
grilled
window
behind
which
was
draped
a
lank
clerk
who
looked
as
though
he
had
never
been
fully
awake
without
glancing
around
the
clerk
asked
a
weary
yes
i
want
a
license
what
kind
what
kinds
do
you
have
hunting
fishing
marriage
building
auto
dog
store
café
a
choice
i
want
a
dog
license
jeff
took
the
yellow
form
and
the
pencil
that
were
offered
to
him
and
started
to
write
he
turned
the
pencil
sideways
and
pressed
until
the
lead
broke
jeff
handed
it
back
this
is
no
good
i
use
one
of
my
own
his
hand
stole
into
the
pack
and
brought
forth
a
mechanical
pencil
not
looking
at
the
clerk
jeff
gave
absorbed
attention
to
the
yellow
form
under
sex
he
wrote
male
when
he
came
to
age
he
looked
shrewdly
at
the
dog
and
penciled
in
yrs
breed
proved
difficult
but
not
for
very
long
sure
that
nobody
else
would
know
it
either
jeff
wrote
algerian
boar
hound
name
was
simple
happily
jeff
wrote
pal
and
shoved
the
slip
back
through
the
grill
the
clerk
was
staring
intently
at
the
pencil
where
you
get
that
this
jeff
held
the
pencil
up
it
a
bagstone
the
newest
thing
i
would
be
without
one
want
to
sell
it
i
have
only
a
couple
left
and
i
may
need
them
what
it
cost
a
dollar
license
is
fifty
cents
can
we
swap
jeff
passed
the
pencil
through
the
grill
but
instead
of
the
expected
fifty
cents
the
clerk
handed
him
another
slip
of
paper
what
this
peddler
license
and
you
a
peddler
they
cost
fifty
cents
so
even
jeff
who
had
thought
the
clerk
a
naïve
rustic
grinned
his
appreciation
of
someone
else
who
knew
how
to
get
what
he
wanted
and
started
down
the
corridor
he
was
still
cheerful
he
bought
a
dozen
of
the
pencils
for
two
dollars
and
all
except
two
were
sold
it
was
a
good
sign
and
he
might
do
a
brisk
business
in
cressman
he
had
thought
so
when
he
came
in
because
there
were
many
stores
and
usually
people
would
not
buy
from
a
peddler
if
they
could
get
what
they
wanted
at
a
store
but
jeff
felt
lucky
coming
in
he
been
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
reach
the
court
house
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
town
now
he
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
it
closely
between
and
people
he
guessed
lived
in
cressman
they
were
supported
by
the
railroad
yards
and
by
a
sawmill
whose
screeching
saw
made
a
hideous
noise
on
that
end
of
town
which
jeff
had
not
yet
visited
and
the
workers
must
be
well
paid
because
there
was
every
evidence
of
prosperity
the
wooden
sidewalks
were
well
cared
for
the
dirt
streets
were
clean
the
horses
on
the
streets
were
good
animals
that
cost
a
fair
amount
of
money
and
there
were
a
few
autos
with
radiators
these
were
all
good
signs
the
fact
that
the
stores
seemed
well
patronized
was
bad
but
jeff
would
be
able
to
tell
until
he
had
done
some
canvassing
of
his
own
and
he
wanted
to
do
that
before
getting
breakfast
for
pal
and
himself
trade
ran
in
cycles
if
one
cressmanite
was
quarreling
with
the
storekeepers
the
chances
were
good
that
the
person
friends
would
be
similarly
disposed
to
take
an
unkind
view
of
merchants
if
there
were
several
such
quarrels
jeff
might
do
a
thriving
business
the
young
trader
took
an
unobtrusive
stand
beside
a
store
whose
sign
read
john
allen
general
merchandise
beneath
that
in
smaller
letters
was
the
best
of
everything
for
everyone
at
the
lowest
prices
pal
sat
down
as
close
as
he
could
get
and
touched
jeff
dangling
hand
with
a
cold
nose
there
were
few
people
on
the
street
but
that
was
to
be
expected
at
this
hour
the
workers
would
be
working
the
housewives
taking
care
of
their
houses
and
the
children
playing
jeff
eyes
roved
down
the
main
street
he
located
and
filed
away
in
his
mind
the
doctor
office
the
dentist
the
stores
the
blacksmith
shop
the
livery
stable
and
other
business
establishments
he
knew
where
the
sawmill
was
and
he
saw
two
church
steeples
with
few
exceptions
all
the
rest
would
be
homes
it
was
a
good
substantial
town
one
of
many
such
that
jeff
had
visited
he
looked
with
mingled
wistfulness
and
amusement
at
a
boy
plodding
down
the
sidewalk
toward
him
about
eight
years
old
the
youngster
wore
a
faded
shirt
torn
pants
and
had
a
dirty
face
that
was
lighted
by
bright
eyes
and
a
grin
he
shuffled
along
being
careful
to
step
only
on
the
cracks
in
the
sidewalk
and
kicking
at
small
objects
in
his
path
then
he
saw
the
dog
his
head
went
up
his
grin
became
a
smile
and
he
hurried
to
pause
in
front
of
jeff
and
pal
gee
he
breathed
is
he
ever
big
what
his
name
pal
jeff
answered
do
you
like
big
dogs
son
i
like
all
dogs
does
he
bite
gentle
as
a
kitten
go
ahead
and
pet
him
pal
stood
his
head
reaching
almost
to
the
youngster
shoulders
and
wagged
a
welcoming
tail
at
the
hand
stretched
toward
him
the
boy
tickled
pal
ears
and
smoothed
his
muzzle
wish
he
was
mine
he
sighed
do
you
have
a
dog
my
paw
the
boy
said
mournfully
wo
let
me
have
one
well
i
got
to
go
down
to
skinner
and
get
maw
some
sugar
take
this
jeff
drew
a
peppermint
stick
from
his
pack
and
extended
it
the
boy
took
it
with
the
same
hand
he
had
used
to
pet
pal
and
grinned
his
thanks
jeff
watched
him
skip
down
the
street
and
sighed
he
liked
everybody
but
he
had
an
especially
soft
spot
in
his
heart
for
children
besides
it
was
good
business
should
he
decide
to
make
a
canvass
he
had
already
paved
the
way
in
at
least
one
home
two
women
passed
going
to
the
far
side
of
the
walk
and
keeping
their
eyes
averted
when
they
reached
jeff
and
a
man
came
from
the
opposite
direction
without
seeming
to
jeff
studied
him
about
thirty
the
man
was
slim
and
supple
snapping
black
eyes
and
a
pert
waxed
mustache
betrayed
his
french
origin
and
from
his
quick
sure
steps
he
was
a
woodsman
he
swerved
into
john
allen
store
and
jeff
decided
that
he
was
a
man
of
short
temper
a
moment
later
that
opinion
was
borne
out
came
an
outraged
roar
you
are
a
dog
among
dogs
a
pig
among
pigs
you
cheat
the
honest
people
there
came
a
snappish
but
calmer
voice
take
it
easy
pierre
pierre
shouted
and
do
i
come
back
he
bristled
out
of
the
store
turned
to
fling
a
final
pig
back
into
it
and
confronted
jeff
you
know
what
he
do
he
screamed
i
need
the
knife
the
good
hunting
knife
for
it
he
wants
a
and
cents
maybe
they
worth
that
much
he
looked
seriously
at
jeff
you
sell
the
hunting
knife
i
do
not
compete
with
merchants
you
sell
the
hunting
knife
pierre
repeated
i
sell
me
the
hunting
knife
but
this
i
demand
sell
me
the
hunting
knife
with
every
show
of
reluctance
jeff
drew
a
hunting
knife
with
a
blade
from
his
pack
pierre
snatched
it
and
his
eyes
lighted
deliriously
how
much
a
dollar
and
twenty
cents
is
good
pierre
pressed
a
rumpled
dollar
bill
and
two
dimes
into
jeff
hand
danced
back
to
the
store
entrance
and
waved
the
knife
as
though
he
were
about
to
go
scalping
with
it
see
he
screamed
at
the
storekeeper
dog
see
the
he
do
better
than
you
i
have
the
hunting
knife
pierre
stamped
fiercely
away
and
jeff
settled
back
to
watch
but
only
for
a
moment
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
store
was
no
more
than
five
feet
three
and
so
thin
that
he
seemed
in
imminent
danger
of
collapsing
his
nose
covering
a
fair
share
of
his
face
was
oddly
like
a
rudder
a
few
strands
of
blond
hair
clung
precariously
to
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
furious
did
you
sell
that
man
a
knife
yes
i
did
without
further
ceremony
but
with
a
roar
that
seemed
incapable
of
emerging
from
one
so
small
the
storekeeper
bellowed
joe
it
was
a
signal
jeff
had
heard
many
times
in
many
voices
that
expressed
it
many
ways
this
was
one
of
the
occasions
when
tarrant
enterprises
had
better
move
fast
the
dog
fell
in
beside
him
as
jeff
started
to
run
he
was
too
late
though
it
was
as
though
the
storekeeper
possessed
some
magical
quality
that
could
conjure
up
images
at
will
jeff
path
was
suddenly
blocked
by
a
burly
man
who
wore
a
gun
a
constable
badge
an
air
of
authority
and
who
had
never
wasted
any
time
acquiring
fat
he
loomed
over
jeff
as
a
mountain
looms
over
a
knoll
what
up
he
demanded
this
peddler
the
storekeeper
reverted
to
his
customary
snappish
voice
is
interfering
with
merchants
he
sold
pierre
lelerc
a
hunting
knife
did
you
the
constable
asked
jeff
yes
but
i
have
a
license
it
not
one
that
allows
you
to
peddle
in
business
districts
the
storekeeper
asserted
jail
him
joe
you
comin
peaceable
the
constable
asked
or
should
i
take
you
peaceable
jeff
answered
hurriedly
always
peaceable
come
on
then
your
dog
got
a
license
look
for
yourself
just
sort
of
watch
your
hand
that
dog
bite
not
usually
see
that
he
do
huh
i
see
jeff
promised
he
fell
resignedly
in
beside
the
constable
while
pal
paced
behind
him
he
thought
ruefully
of
how
little
a
feeling
of
good
fortune
could
be
trusted
still
by
no
means
would
this
be
the
first
jail
to
have
him
as
guest
and
probably
it
would
not
be
the
last
he
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
nice
town
you
have
here
he
said
companionably
yeah
the
constable
was
entirely
willing
to
be
friendly
it
all
right
how
long
have
you
been
chief
of
police
in
cressman
nine
years
say
that
a
good
title
chief
of
police
huh
you
should
call
yourself
that
jeff
asserted
do
you
have
much
trouble
the
constable
shrugged
it
depends
there
just
one
thing
i
wonder
about
jeff
said
i
met
a
lot
of
police
in
a
lot
of
towns
all
the
rest
had
silver
badges
how
come
yours
is
brass
it
was
silver
when
i
got
it
the
constable
said
ruefully
blame
thing
turned
color
on
me
why
do
you
polish
it
i
do
ever
night
use
soap
and
all
ca
do
a
thing
with
it
have
you
tried
blecker
silver
polish
what
that
a
polish
for
badges
never
heard
of
it
some
store
in
cressman
should
stock
it
they
do
i
tried
everything
they
have
he
looked
searchingly
at
jeff
do
you
have
any
yes
but
jeff
laughed
nervously
you
already
got
me
on
one
charge
i
would
care
to
be
up
on
two
let
me
see
it
the
constable
urged
i
better
not
i
wo
tell
a
person
and
you
have
the
word
of
joe
parker
for
that
come
on
let
sneak
behind
this
fence
and
have
a
look
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
fence
jeff
took
a
jar
of
blecker
unique
silver
polish
from
his
pack
dipped
an
end
of
his
handkerchief
lightly
into
it
and
carefully
rubbed
a
small
portion
of
the
badge
as
though
by
magic
the
tarnish
disappeared
and
bright
silver
gleamed
where
it
had
been
how
much
does
that
cost
the
constable
breathed
thirty
cents
a
jar
but
you
treated
me
so
nicely
i
let
you
have
two
for
fifty
cents
thanks
the
constable
slipped
the
two
jars
into
his
trousers
pocket
gave
jeff
a
half
dollar
and
said
guess
we
better
get
to
jail
guess
we
had
the
constable
steered
jeff
and
pal
back
to
the
court
house
but
took
them
into
the
basement
instead
of
the
main
entrance
there
were
two
windows
with
a
desk
beneath
them
and
behind
the
desk
sat
a
man
with
a
friendly
face
but
a
weary
smile
in
the
corridor
beyond
were
four
jail
cells
the
constable
paused
at
the
desk
hi
pop
he
greeted
the
jailer
this
peddler
was
peddlin
near
stores
you
tell
him
what
to
do
with
his
dog
and
pack
huh
without
another
glance
at
jeff
joe
parker
turned
and
started
back
toward
the
entrance
even
as
he
walked
he
industriously
polished
his
badge
escape
the
jailer
tilted
his
chair
clamped
both
hands
behind
his
head
and
looked
steadily
at
the
new
arrival
jeff
stood
still
sensing
something
here
that
had
not
been
evident
at
first
glance
pop
had
a
kindly
face
and
a
weary
smile
but
were
they
a
mask
after
a
moment
he
spoke
what
are
you
doing
here
boy
getting
in
jail
you
a
peddler
i
represent
tarrant
enterprises
now
i
have
here
whoa
whoa
there
i
see
a
lot
of
peddlers
my
knife
is
all
right
my
watch
is
all
right
i
do
need
tooth
picks
tooth
brushes
or
anything
else
and
i
have
any
family
how
long
have
you
been
peddling
quite
a
spell
you
ever
been
in
trouble
before
jeff
said
blandly
i
been
in
jail
before
you
just
a
kid
and
i
do
like
to
see
kids
in
trouble
the
jailer
murmured
sadly
how
much
trouble
am
i
in
you
be
kept
until
you
can
be
brought
before
justice
murphy
fine
you
five
dollars
and
tell
you
to
get
out
of
town
ca
i
see
him
now
justice
murphy
the
jailer
said
has
gone
fishing
he
wo
be
back
for
a
week
then
i
to
be
your
guest
for
a
week
it
looks
that
way
might
as
well
get
you
checked
in
he
took
a
pad
of
forms
from
the
desk
and
balanced
a
pencil
in
the
proper
places
he
inscribed
jeff
name
age
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged
and
other
pertinent
data
he
looked
closely
at
what
he
had
written
and
from
the
dark
cells
in
back
came
a
shouted
hey
pop
who
the
new
tenant
shut
up
ike
aw
bring
him
back
pop
bucky
and
me
like
to
meet
him
you
two
be
quiet
pop
reprimanded
the
prisoner
then
he
addressed
jeff
ike
wilson
and
bucky
edwards
they
finally
got
caught
what
for
stealing
chickens
jeff
looked
unbelieving
and
the
jailer
face
became
less
gentle
for
a
moment
he
was
almost
stern
that
serious
it
is
a
light
matter
i
know
then
why
did
you
look
so
doubtful
it
seems
a
few
chickens
are
hardly
worth
a
jail
sentence
they
not
and
neither
is
anything
else
but
some
people
never
learn
that
it
just
happens
those
boys
were
satisfied
with
one
chicken
they
got
three
thousand
that
anybody
knows
about
whew
they
pay
for
it
now
jeff
i
have
to
take
your
dog
jeff
sparred
for
time
he
had
known
other
people
in
similar
circumstances
whose
dog
had
been
taken
away
and
half
the
time
simply
disappeared
that
they
sickened
and
died
was
the
usual
story
but
actually
they
been
destroyed
because
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
take
care
of
them
outwardly
jeff
affected
an
air
of
supreme
indifference
sure
he
agreed
go
ahead
just
be
careful
pal
does
like
a
lot
of
people
and
he
bites
whoever
he
dislikes
better
be
careful
he
gets
his
regular
feeding
every
day
too
that
four
pounds
of
the
best
ground
steak
he
hates
everybody
if
he
does
get
it
yeah
pop
was
not
at
all
friendly
now
suppose
he
gets
sick
if
i
do
get
him
back
and
in
as
good
a
shape
as
when
he
was
taken
away
i
know
a
couple
of
good
lawyers
lawyers
cost
money
i
have
a
certain
amount
of
influence
pop
rubbed
his
chin
reflectively
and
stared
at
the
window
i
suppose
you
could
keep
him
in
your
cell
if
you
want
to
pay
for
his
board
i
might
jeff
said
knowing
he
had
won
this
round
and
that
his
chance
shot
had
hit
the
obviously
for
reasons
of
his
own
pop
did
not
care
to
have
any
lawyers
investigating
anything
how
good
a
cell
pop
was
all
brittle
now
if
you
been
in
other
cells
you
know
how
good
how
old
are
you
old
enough
to
land
in
jail
that
tie
you
wearing
pop
it
hardly
befits
the
dignity
of
your
position
and
i
told
you
not
to
try
to
sell
anything
to
me
maybe
just
maybe
we
can
think
up
some
other
charge
we
buy
if
we
had
any
money
the
man
in
the
back
cell
yelled
your
name
peddler
jeff
tarrant
representing
tarrant
enterprises
ltd
the
most
quality
for
the
most
discriminating
people
what
that
mean
it
means
shut
up
pop
snarled
you
a
smart
one
huh
jeff
said
meekly
all
i
know
is
black
from
white
i
take
my
pack
in
the
cell
too
do
i
no
i
know
exactly
what
in
it
jeff
warned
and
i
know
just
what
to
do
if
even
a
penny
worth
is
missing
maybe
i
know
what
to
do
if
missing
we
can
get
tough
too
i
want
that
pack
all
right
keep
it
and
come
on
pal
stayed
very
close
to
jeff
as
pop
led
them
toward
the
cells
the
two
chicken
thieves
came
to
the
front
of
theirs
and
clasped
the
bars
with
their
hands
they
were
wholly
delighted
because
in
his
brush
with
jeff
pop
had
come
off
second
best
jeff
grinned
back
at
them
hi
jeff
got
anything
to
make
our
happy
home
happier
tarrant
enterprises
has
something
for
everyone
and
can
please
you
here
is
a
nice
hack
saw
i
take
that
pop
said
you
take
it
for
cents
hand
it
over
you
get
it
back
when
you
leave
well
jeff
gave
him
the
hack
saw
and
the
pair
in
the
adjoining
cell
roared
with
laughter
pop
asked
got
any
more
unfortunately
the
hack
saw
department
is
understocked
and
our
new
order
has
not
arrived
get
in
pop
unlocked
a
cell
and
jeff
and
pal
entered
the
bars
were
in
front
only
the
cells
were
separated
by
brick
walls
adjusting
his
eyes
to
the
gloomy
interior
jeff
saw
two
bunks
with
dirty
mattresses
suspended
by
chains
that
were
attached
to
the
wall
there
was
an
iron
stand
upon
which
stood
a
chipped
basin
and
a
faded
towel
beneath
the
stand
was
a
bucket
pop
slammed
the
door
i
sleep
in
front
he
advised
i
got
a
shotgun
and
i
know
how
to
use
it
besides
just
trying
to
break
out
can
mean
six
months
in
prison
think
it
over
sure
jeff
smiled
pop
strode
back
to
the
desk
while
the
two
chicken
thieves
shouted
raucous
insults
jeff
lost
himself
in
thought
the
situation
had
been
quite
obvious
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
jail
few
towns
had
a
jailer
for
two
or
three
prisoners
unless
there
were
other
factors
involved
and
almost
without
exception
such
factors
existed
only
when
there
were
certain
affairs
that
would
not
bear
close
examination
the
majority
of
cressman
citizens
probably
were
honest
people
but
some
of
its
officials
were
not
the
fact
that
they
could
be
dishonest
only
because
the
rest
were
indifferent
to
the
way
their
town
affairs
were
conducted
did
not
change
the
situation
if
he
were
one
of
the
inside
clique
pop
would
have
a
better
job
but
he
evidently
knew
enough
so
that
he
had
to
be
given
something
in
order
to
prevent
his
talking
pop
reaction
when
jeff
expressed
such
utter
willingness
to
take
the
matter
up
with
an
attorney
offered
additional
proof
of
this
jeff
let
his
hand
fondle
pal
head
as
he
considered
his
chances
there
was
little
possibility
of
breaking
out
by
force
and
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
do
so
anyway
as
things
stood
he
faced
a
minor
charge
breaking
jail
was
a
major
one
it
was
illegal
to
keep
him
confined
for
seven
days
without
benefit
of
counsel
but
that
could
be
brushed
over
they
could
always
claim
that
they
had
held
him
on
suspicion
of
some
more
serious
charge
jeff
sighed
he
held
a
club
over
cressman
but
cressman
held
him
in
jail
he
scratched
pal
ears
and
murmured
let
it
never
be
said
that
tarrant
enterprises
gave
way
to
despair
what
you
say
jeff
ike
called
comfortable
home
jeff
answered
gaily
counted
the
cockroaches
in
your
private
suite
not
yet
we
got
ike
said
proudly
one
nigh
as
big
as
that
dog
of
yours
what
you
got
in
your
pack
candles
jeff
suggested
law
if
bucky
and
me
had
any
money
we
buy
some
jeff
took
three
candles
which
he
bought
for
a
penny
and
sold
for
three
cents
each
from
his
pocket
he
handed
two
of
them
and
a
half
dozen
matches
around
the
end
of
his
cell
a
gift
from
tarrant
enterprises
thanks
tarrant
we
pay
you
soon
we
found
us
a
fortune
i
count
on
it
jeff
said
he
lighted
the
third
candle
dripped
wax
from
it
onto
the
iron
stand
and
set
it
upright
in
its
own
drippings
by
its
flickering
light
he
examined
the
cell
more
closely
it
was
what
he
had
expected
the
floor
was
dirty
the
mattresses
only
a
little
less
so
and
cockroaches
scurried
for
cracks
jeff
let
his
hand
brush
pal
head
again
completely
trusting
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
and
shoved
his
nose
against
his
master
thigh
dragging
the
mattress
from
the
top
bunk
jeff
laid
it
on
the
floor
conceivably
even
a
dog
would
protest
against
sleeping
up
there
hunger
reminded
jeff
that
neither
he
nor
pal
had
eaten
anything
since
last
night
and
again
he
took
refuge
in
the
happy
thought
that
first
things
must
be
first
he
edged
up
to
the
bars
and
said
softly
ike
yeah
where
the
food
come
from
around
here
the
garbage
can
ike
answered
sadly
anyhow
that
what
i
think
can
we
get
any
other
if
you
got
money
you
can
ask
pop
nothing
like
trying
jeff
raised
his
voice
hey
pop
what
do
you
want
how
about
something
to
eat
it
not
lunch
time
how
about
some
anyhow
got
any
money
jeff
replied
mournfully
a
few
pennies
that
i
been
saving
for
my
old
age
i
can
pay
for
it
pop
came
to
the
cell
what
you
want
three
loaves
of
bread
and
three
half
pounds
of
cheese
let
have
the
money
bring
it
first
show
me
the
money
jeff
held
up
two
crumpled
dollar
bills
pop
walked
to
the
entrance
and
there
came
the
click
of
his
key
turning
in
the
lock
breathless
silence
reigned
this
was
a
momentous
occasion
that
must
be
properly
observed
ten
minutes
later
the
key
clicked
again
and
pop
came
in
with
parcels
three
loaves
of
bread
he
read
from
a
slip
eighteen
cents
a
pound
and
a
half
of
cheese
thirty
cents
and
he
looked
maliciously
at
jeff
four
pounds
of
the
best
ground
steak
for
the
dog
one
dollar
jeff
grinned
his
own
words
had
backfired
on
him
he
had
intended
to
give
pal
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
half
pound
of
cheese
to
offer
the
same
to
those
in
the
next
cell
and
to
keep
as
much
for
himself
but
he
did
not
lose
his
aplomb
exactly
he
exclaimed
just
what
i
wanted
but
i
would
think
of
paying
in
money
when
i
can
offer
something
of
great
value
now
give
me
the
money
pop
growled
a
dollar
and
cents
oh
well
if
you
must
be
crass
jeff
gave
him
a
dollar
bill
and
cents
in
change
give
my
pals
in
the
next
cell
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
pound
of
cheese
thanks
ike
said
feelingly
and
even
the
silent
bucky
mumbled
his
gratitude
jeff
laid
his
pack
on
the
lower
bunk
put
his
food
on
the
pack
and
made
two
sandwiches
with
a
half
pound
of
raw
ground
steak
between
each
he
spread
a
paper
scooped
two
pounds
of
steak
upon
it
and
gave
it
to
pal
the
rest
of
the
steak
he
passed
into
the
next
cell
this
ike
exclaimed
is
as
good
as
a
hotel
best
grub
i
ever
threw
a
lip
over
jeff
if
ever
you
want
a
helping
hand
you
can
count
on
me
and
bucky
i
remember
jeff
promised
he
ate
his
two
sandwiches
while
pal
licked
thoroughly
the
paper
in
which
the
steak
had
been
wrapped
then
he
looked
up
appealingly
and
jeff
threw
him
a
quarter
loaf
of
bread
the
rest
of
the
food
he
put
in
his
pack
he
heard
ike
whispered
jeff
jeff
went
to
the
front
of
the
cell
yes
you
want
to
get
out
of
here
i
make
like
i
sick
when
that
old
fool
comes
in
bucky
and
me
will
grab
him
and
get
his
keys
we
give
to
you
and
you
can
beat
it
what
about
you

ike
scoffed

much
more
to

going
to
do
thanks
just
the
same
but
we
better
not

this
hole

but
there
must
be
a
better
way
there
none
quicker
i
know
thanks
anyway
why
do
you
two
get
out
we
do
ike
mourned
how
we
know
when
we
got
bill
wheeler
chickens
that
bill
call
his
seven
brothers
in
asettin
round
the
town
just
waitin
for
me
and
bucky
to
break
loose
and
every
one
of
with
a
rifle
when
bucky
and
me
go
out
of
cressman
we
got
to
go
with
officers
jeff
chuckled
too
bad
ike
but
i
do
want
to
break
jail
the
day
wore
on
grown
accustomed
to
the
candle
light
the
cockroaches
came
out
of
their
cracks
and
scurried
across
the
floor
this
proved
vastly
intriguing
to
pal
who
watched
them
interestedly
he
made
quick
little
rushes
but
the
cockroaches
always
escaped
jeff
walked
restlessly
around
the
small
cell
there
had
to
be
a
way
out
because
there
was
a
way
out
of
everything
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
suddenly
inspired
he
called
pop
what
i
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
still
there
of
course
i
here
jeff
who
had
intended
to
hold
a
bill
against
the
cell
bars
and
indicate
that
it
would
be
pop
in
exchange
for
freedom
abandoned
the
plan
almost
as
soon
as
he
conceived
it
because
it
was
hardly
consistent
with
the
business
policies
of
tarrant
enterprises
or
with
its
standards
he
must
pay
for
nothing
if
he
could
trade
and
there
had
to
be
something
he
could
trade
for
release
bucky
said
fretfully
jeff
what
do
you
want
got
anything
in
that
pack
of
yours
that
help
pass
time
how
about
some
music
anything
jeff
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
mouth
organ
with
which
he
often
beguiled
the
hours
he
was
happy
again
and
his
smile
glowed
once
more
he
been
thinking
too
hard
if
he
relaxed
with
the
mouth
organ
for
a
little
while
and
cleared
his
mind
he
would
get
some
new
ideas
by
way
of
tuning
up
he
blew
a
soft
note
and
the
cell
erupted
pal
who
had
been
lying
quietly
on
the
mattress
leaped
to
his
feet
pointed
his
head
erect
and
voiced
a
weird
howl
it
was
not
the
cry
of
a
dog
but
a
banshee
shriek
a
wailing
of
lost
souls
and
tortured
beings
and
it
filled
the
room
like
a
solid
substance
descending
on
a
low
moan
it
stopped
pal
lifted
his
lips
and
snarled
fiercely
the
two
in
the
next
cell
gave
way
to
hysterical
laughter
and
pop
bustled
from
his
desk
you
have
to
keep
that
dog
he
took
a
backward
step
as
pal
snarled
again
the
mouth
organ
hidden
in
his
hand
jeff
stood
innocently
pop
stared
why
does
he
do
that
i
do
know
you
have
to
keep
him
quiet
i
try
jeff
promised
his
blue
eyes
were
dancing
and
his
smile
broadened
some
dogs
were
affected
by
sounds
beyond
those
which
normally
came
to
their
ears
and
jeff
had
never
decided
whether
they
reacted
because
certain
noises
grated
harshly
on
their
ears
because
some
sounds
reminded
them
of
a
battle
or
other
experience
or
if
they
were
merely
inclined
to
be
in
tune
obviously
pal
was
given
to
the
latter
sort
of
response
waiting
until
pop
returned
to
the
desk
jeff
blew
the
same
note
as
softly
pal
responded
with
a
whole
chorus
of
shrieks
that
began
on
a
tenor
note
and
ascended
to
a
high
soprano
the
echoes
rolled
back
from
the
walls
and
seemed
to
bound
forward
again
it
was
almost
an
incredible
thing
that
was
promptly
repeated
when
jeff
blew
another
note
shut
that
dog
up
pop
shrieked
i
trying
jeff
said
desperately
the
door
opened
joe
parker
came
in
jeff
blew
again
very
softly
and
pal
immediate
response
filled
the
room
their
faces
angry
pop
and
the
constable
appeared
in
front
of
the
cell
and
shouted
to
make
themselves
heard
quiet
what
you
say
jeff
yelled
quiet
pal
stopped
howling
but
he
stopped
so
abruptly
that
the
constable
still
shouted
if
you
ca
make
that
dog
be
quiet
i
take
him
out
of
here
pal
voiced
the
snarl
that
followed
his
howling
and
both
men
stepped
back
joe
parker
hand
dipped
to
his
gun
you
do
have
to
shout
jeff
soothed
i
can
hear
you
and
i
shoot
either
the
dog
mine
he
ca
possibly
hurt
you
and
there
are
two
witnesses
who
will
prove
it
sure
thing
ike
agreed
happily
bucky
and
me
are
your
boys
make
him
stop
yelling
the
constable
said
people
are
standing
on
the
street
wondering
who
getting
murdered
down
here
send
them
down
jeff
invited
i
represent
tarrant
enterprises
and
i
might
sell
that
dog
has
to
stop
yelling
jeff
shook
a
chiding
finger
at
pal
stop
yelling
pop
and
the
constable
left
ike
and
bucky
chuckled
pal
sat
down
expectant
eyes
fixed
on
the
hand
that
held
jeff
mouth
organ
he
knew
now
where
the
sound
originated
and
he
was
ready
the
instant
jeff
raised
his
hand
pop
and
the
constable
their
faces
entreating
rather
than
commanding
came
back
ca
you
make
him
shut
up
i
told
him
you
heard
me
tell
him
we
ca
have
that
noise
why
not
ike
jeered
does
it
keep
all
the
workers
in
the
court
house
awake
judge
carlson
trying
to
work
the
constable
said
he
be
working
until
nine
tonight
thought
you
said
he
gone
fishing
jeff
accused
pop
that
justice
murphy
he
hears
all
the
cases
where
no
more
than
fifty
dollars
is
involved
do
make
the
judge
mad
ike
chortled
what
if
he
gets
real
upset
ca
you
make
him
shut
up
the
constable
pleaded
i
try
the
two
went
back
to
the
desk
a
match
flared
there
and
an
oil
lamp
cast
its
yellow
glow
into
the
corridor
apparently
night
was
approaching
the
constable
left
and
jeff
pocketed
the
mouth
organ
five
minutes
later
he
brought
it
out
again
and
once
more
pal
wrecked
the
silence
the
door
burst
open
slammed
shut
and
pop
and
the
constable
stood
before
jeff
cell
joe
parker
spoke
how
you
like
to
get
out
peddler
i
do
know
jeff
said
smoothly
i
like
it
here
now
look
why
ca
you
be
reasonable
we
have
got
much
on
you
and
we
not
mad
at
you
going
to
be
plumb
out
of
their
minds
if
that
dog
howls
down
here
for
a
whole
week
what
your
proposition
jeff
asked
serenely
we
leave
you
out
give
you
and
that
howling
wolf
pack
ten
minutes
to
get
out
of
town
and
start
looking
for
you
jeff
hesitated
scenting
a
trap
and
guessing
that
something
besides
pal
howling
was
involved
probably
pop
had
not
been
reticent
about
the
new
prisoner
willingness
to
consult
attorneys
jeff
said
finally
and
if
you
catch
me
you
have
me
for
breaking
jail
too
the
constable
retorted
grimly
we
do
aim
to
hunt
hard
for
a
moment
jeff
pondered
as
though
considering
everything
seriously
his
face
was
solemn
when
he
looked
up
nope
he
said
it
not
enough
ike
looked
pained
what
do
you
want
for
getting
out
of
jail
pop
owes
me
cents
for
a
hack
saw
i
give
the
hack
saw
back
pop
offered
quickly
i
do
want
it
i
want
cents
oh
for
pete
sake
pop
took
a
purse
from
his
pocket
counted
out
cents
and
passed
it
through
the
bars
jeff
pocketed
the
money
what
the
next
town
stay
right
in
the
valley
seven
miles
down
you
come
to
delview
you
ca
miss
and
heaven
help
delview
if
they
pick
you
up
any
other
place
north
through
the
mountains
there
smithville
better
not
try
it
there
no
direct
road
and
those
mountains
are
plenty
rugged
good
town
though
ike
called
that
constable
in
smithville
he
minds
his
own
business
most
of
the
time
so
does
most
else
it
pays
in
smithville
wild
place
huh
not
wild
ike
declared
just
sensible
i
go
to
delview
jeff
decided
that
cressman
ike
snorted
they
jail
you
there
for
you
got
to
go
now
joe
pointed
out
you
took
pop
money
open
the
cell
jeff
ike
called
bucky
may
be
seeing
you
take
care
of
yourselves
outside
instead
of
going
to
the
main
street
jeff
slipped
behind
the
court
house
two
more
moving
shadows
in
a
place
of
shadows
he
and
pal
flitted
past
a
cluster
of
lilacs
and
darted
to
a
patch
of
trees
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
town
always
alert
and
careful
again
on
the
outskirts
of
cressman
jeff
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
road
once
more
pal
had
saved
the
day
apparently
pop
and
the
constable
had
wanted
only
and
wholeheartedly
to
be
rid
of
them
jeff
felt
a
little
saddened
the
shining
name
of
tarrant
enterprises
had
become
a
little
tarnished
in
cressman
the
concern
had
spent
money
and
earned
little
enough
jeff
was
startled
by
the
gruff
command
wait
thar
he
halted
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
looked
closely
at
him
pointed
a
shotgun
at
the
ground
and
said
go
ahead
jeff
thought
of
ike
and
bucky
probably
this
man
was
one
of
the
pickets
waiting
for
them
he
recovered
his
cheer
there
were
always
fresh
customers
down
the
road
but
they
would
not
be
where
jeff
had
told
joe
parker
he
intended
to
seek
them
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
send
a
message
to
delview
and
to
ask
the
police
there
to
be
alert
for
a
peddler
accompanied
by
a
huge
dog
at
the
first
break
in
the
mountains
jeff
left
the
road
and
started
for
the
opportunities
that
must
surely
await
him
in
smithville
the
cabin
the
rising
sun
turned
the
tops
of
the
mountains
to
gold
and
like
water
sunshine
crept
gradually
down
the
slopes
in
a
grove
of
pines
a
chickaree
came
out
of
the
warm
nest
where
he
had
spent
the
night
three
inches
from
his
nest
the
chickaree
paused
on
an
outjutting
stub
a
hawk
winged
through
the
pines
regularly
and
though
it
had
always
missed
by
a
comfortable
margin
it
had
struck
three
times
at
the
chickaree
the
pines
were
part
of
a
marten
beat
and
the
marten
had
chased
the
chickaree
several
times
in
addition
on
their
way
to
one
place
or
another
various
other
predators
wandered
through
the
pines
and
few
of
them
were
averse
to
eating
chickaree
the
chickaree
held
perfectly
still
bright
eyes
glowing
and
small
ears
straining
neither
the
hawk
nor
the
marten
were
present
and
the
chickaree
was
puzzled
because
he
could
see
nothing
else
that
should
not
be
three
big
bucks
were
spending
the
season
on
this
slope
and
every
night
they
bedded
in
the
pines
this
morning
there
was
no
sign
of
them
though
he
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
the
chickaree
knew
that
something
was
present
if
only
because
the
deer
were
not
after
five
minutes
having
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
immediate
threat
the
chickaree
set
out
to
find
whatever
he
had
sensed
he
scampered
up
the
pine
leaped
effortlessly
into
another
and
took
a
different
stand
again
he
examined
the
grove
a
smell
of
wood
smoke
tickled
his
nostrils
and
the
chickaree
knew
that
a
man
had
come
to
the
pines
that
much
discovered
he
went
into
action
he
leaped
to
another
pine
raced
swiftly
up
it
and
made
a
leap
so
long
that
the
twigs
upon
which
he
landed
bent
precariously
a
master
of
aerial
travel
the
chickaree
paid
no
heed
three
minutes
later
he
found
the
man
sleeping
under
a
big
pine
there
was
a
huge
dog
beside
him
and
a
bed
of
glowing
coals
so
arranged
that
the
heat
they
cast
enveloped
both
man
and
dog
the
chickaree
paused
anger
in
his
eyes
he
had
squatters
rights
in
these
pines
and
he
lacked
the
remotest
intention
of
sharing
them
with
any
man
biting
off
a
pine
cone
the
chickaree
dropped
it
squarely
on
the
man
face
jeff
tarrant
came
awake
there
was
no
lingering
struggle
to
achieve
complete
wakefulness
and
no
dropping
back
for
another
five
minutes
slumber
because
jeff
had
long
since
learned
that
that
must
never
be
he
had
to
awaken
instantly
and
at
the
least
disturbance
because
there
was
always
a
possibility
that
he
might
have
to
get
up
fighting
and
he
had
a
distinct
impression
that
something
had
dropped
on
his
face
swift
glances
in
all
directions
told
him
that
there
was
nothing
except
pal
near
and
jeff
relaxed
now
he
could
attend
to
the
ceremony
of
awakening
jeff
rubbed
his
eyes
yawned
stretched
and
rose
rising
with
him
pal
saw
the
chickaree
following
the
dog
gaze
jeff
saw
it
too
appalled
by
his
own
boldness
the
chickaree
was
putting
distance
between
jeff
and
himself
as
rapidly
as
possible
jeff
grinned
so
he
does
want
us
around
either
pal
seems
to
me
that
lately
nobody
has
wanted
anything
to
do
with
tarrant
enterprises
shame
on
them
pal
wagged
his
tail
and
made
an
enthusiastic
attempt
to
lick
his
master
face
jeff
pushed
him
away
pal
tongue
was
approximately
the
size
of
a
dish
towel
and
the
consistency
of
sand
paper
not
to
be
defeated
pal
got
in
a
number
of
good
licks
on
his
friend
hand
and
jeff
chided
cut
it
out
i
can
wash
myself
as
he
walked
to
a
little
runlet
that
trickled
through
the
pines
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
jeff
thought
of
last
night
in
the
valley
up
which
he
had
traveled
that
runlet
became
a
stream
with
several
deep
pools
having
fallen
into
two
of
them
last
night
jeff
had
discovered
the
pools
the
hard
way
but
he
had
achieved
his
purpose
it
was
not
only
possible
but
highly
probable
that
joe
parker
and
pop
had
ideas
which
they
had
bothered
to
disclose
when
letting
jeff
out
of
jail
if
they
were
able
to
catch
him
again
he
would
be
charged
with
jail
breaking
that
meant
six
months
and
six
months
was
plenty
of
time
to
steal
the
pack
contents
however
even
if
they
followed
him
into
the
mountains
they
could
catch
him
a
satisfying
vision
of
the
delview
police
looking
for
him
and
of
pop
and
the
constable
hopefully
waiting
formed
in
jeff
mind
he
grinned
happily
even
though
he
was
stranded
in
a
wilderness
with
no
customers
in
sight
and
no
telling
when
he
would
find
any
tarrant
enterprises
was
in
business
again
jeff
took
his
watch
out
saw
that
it
had
stopped
set
it
for
nine
and
wound
it
he
might
be
an
hour
two
hours
or
three
hours
off
it
made
no
difference
tarrant
enterprises
guided
its
fortunes
by
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
and
not
by
the
dial
of
a
watch
or
clock
any
hour
of
the
or
any
minute
of
any
hour
might
present
a
precious
and
never
to
be
repeated
opportunity
therefore
it
was
better
to
be
alert
for
what
the
moment
might
present
than
to
depend
too
heavily
on
any
timepiece
last
night
he
had
been
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
think
of
eating
and
when
he
had
finally
put
what
he
considered
an
adequate
distance
between
cressman
and
himself
he
had
been
too
tired
now
he
took
the
remainder
of
bread
and
cheese
from
his
pack
and
divided
both
in
half
chow
time
he
said
grandly
here
pal
a
wonderful
breakfast
pal
gulped
his
portion
jeff
ate
more
slowly
and
when
he
had
finished
the
last
crumb
he
was
completely
serene
it
mattered
not
at
all
that
he
was
completely
out
of
food
or
that
it
was
an
unknown
distance
to
the
next
place
where
he
would
be
able
to
buy
more
by
all
means
the
future
should
be
carefully
weighed
but
the
future
was
a
great
and
shining
promise
and
lack
of
food
a
small
inconvenience
let
go
he
said
happily
a
little
breeze
sang
to
him
the
sun
warmed
him
and
he
was
completely
cheerful
as
he
resumed
his
journey
this
was
a
new
and
fresh
experience
and
as
such
it
was
to
be
treasured
pal
ran
a
hundred
feet
ahead
slowed
to
a
walk
and
further
slowed
to
a
stalk
so
deliberate
that
he
moved
at
a
snail
pace
he
looked
questioningly
back
at
jeff
jeff
wrinkled
his
brows
in
town
or
even
near
other
people
pal
had
not
moved
more
than
a
yard
away
here
he
would
leave
jeff
and
that
was
entirely
understandable
naturally
he
would
feel
freer
in
the
wilderness
but
what
did
he
want
jeff
halted
what
up
pal
the
dog
stared
hard
at
a
copse
of
brush
and
for
a
moment
jeff
remained
still
then
he
advanced
slowly
hope
i
not
doing
it
wrong
he
murmured
i
know
you
trying
to
tell
me
something
but
i
too
dumb
to
understand
your
language
pal
stayed
perfectly
rigid
until
jeff
was
within
five
feet
then
went
in
to
flush
two
grouse
from
the
brush
they
winged
thunderously
up
and
drummed
away
and
a
great
light
dawned
on
jeff
if
pal
had
not
had
a
former
master
he
would
not
have
been
wearing
a
collar
and
obviously
that
master
had
lived
partly
by
hunting
scenting
the
grouse
pal
had
been
asking
jeff
as
plainly
as
a
dog
can
ask
anything
whether
or
not
he
cared
to
shoot
them
jeff
petted
pal
and
heaped
praise
upon
him
good
dog
he
exclaimed
that
the
boy
pal
sighed
ecstatically
because
he
had
pleased
his
master
he
had
already
helped
jeff
out
of
two
difficult
situations
and
for
that
alone
he
deserved
loyalty
now
it
became
evident
that
he
would
not
be
wholly
dead
weight
jeff
who
had
learned
something
about
dogs
reviewed
what
he
knew
there
were
various
dogs
for
various
purposes
thus
the
bull
was
for
fighting
the
dachshund
went
into
burrows
and
dragged
out
whatever
sought
a
refuge
there
the
setter
hunted
game
birds
the
hound
trailed
etc
occasionally
there
was
an
intelligent
mongrel
that
combined
the
functions
of
two
or
more
such
specialists
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
pal
crawling
into
burrows
but
he
had
already
proven
his
ability
to
hunt
birds
would
he
do
anything
else
it
occurred
to
jeff
that
he
knew
little
about
his
new
partner
and
until
now
he
had
had
little
chance
to
do
any
probing
now
there
was
every
chance
heel
he
ordered
pal
fell
in
beside
him
walking
at
his
left
and
just
far
enough
away
so
there
was
no
danger
of
collision
jeff
was
delighted
he
had
already
discovered
that
pal
responded
perfectly
to
other
commands
and
must
have
had
much
training
five
minutes
later
there
came
an
interruption
buzzing
angrily
through
the
trees
a
bee
made
straight
for
jeff
it
danced
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
face
seeking
a
place
to
light
jeff
swiped
at
it
with
his
right
hand
when
he
did
pal
bounded
forward
swift
as
a
deer
and
as
graceful
he
raced
among
the
trees
with
seeming
lack
of
effort
he
leaped
high
the
better
to
see
what
lay
about
him
finding
nothing
he
looked
back
perplexedly
come
on
jeff
coaxed
come
on
pal
pal
returned
and
jeff
petted
him
fondly
now
he
knew
something
else
about
the
dog
a
hand
waved
forward
was
pal
signal
to
look
for
game
jeff
stored
the
knowledge
away
pending
the
time
it
might
be
useful
pal
ranged
ahead
and
on
both
sides
jeff
strode
on
the
mountain
had
been
steep
but
its
summit
was
a
broad
plateau
covered
with
pine
forest
and
somewhere
in
the
distant
peaks
that
jeff
could
see
must
lie
the
town
of
smithville
sooner
or
later
he
would
get
there
and
if
he
needed
two
or
three
days
that
was
all
right
he
was
enjoying
the
hike
and
the
farther
away
smithville
was
the
farther
he
be
from
cressman
he
stopped
to
rest
at
a
pond
that
fed
a
stream
and
saw
trout
in
the
clear
waters
removing
his
pack
he
opened
the
right
compartment
and
took
from
it
a
fishing
line
and
a
box
of
hooks
he
tied
a
hook
to
the
line
cut
a
pole
from
a
copse
of
willows
growing
beside
the
pond
kicked
a
rock
over
and
gathered
up
the
fat
worms
beneath
it
baited
and
cast
a
dozen
trout
rushed
the
bait
one
got
it
and
jeff
landed
him
he
continued
to
cast
until
he
had
nine
trout
jeff
dressed
them
washed
them
took
a
grill
and
salt
and
pepper
from
the
pack
and
cooked
his
fish
pal
cleaned
up
all
the
heads
all
the
bones
and
four
trout
jeff
ate
the
rest
smacking
his
lips
over
them
and
entirely
happy
this
he
sighed
is
the
way
to
live
they
descended
into
a
valley
and
were
crossing
a
field
when
a
rabbit
flushed
in
front
of
them
white
tail
flashing
it
streaked
through
the
grass
jeff
waved
his
right
arm
and
pal
raced
forward
so
effortlessly
that
he
almost
seemed
to
float
he
overtook
the
fleeing
rabbit
and
snatched
it
up
the
rabbit
dangling
from
his
jaws
he
trotted
back
and
laid
his
game
in
jeff
hand
jeff
laughed
in
sheer
delight
almost
always
he
canvassed
the
back
country
because
that
was
the
only
place
where
usually
he
could
be
pretty
sure
of
doing
good
business
but
he
had
been
so
interested
in
his
customers
that
he
had
had
little
time
for
the
wilderness
now
there
was
an
opportunity
to
see
and
observe
and
he
liked
everything
around
him
he
still
wanted
to
wander
but
if
he
ever
did
settle
down
it
would
be
in
such
a
place
the
two
camped
that
night
in
another
grove
of
pines
not
knowing
where
they
were
and
not
caring
and
jeff
broiled
the
rabbit
it
was
stringy
and
tough
but
hunger
proved
a
powerful
sauce
and
when
jeff
chewed
and
swallowed
the
last
few
shreds
of
meat
he
felt
as
though
he
had
partaken
of
princely
fare
i
would
mind
if
this
went
on
for
a
long
while
he
told
the
contented
pal
i
like
it
almost
as
much
as
you
do
he
arranged
a
fire
to
reflect
against
a
fallen
tree
trunk
slept
soundly
all
night
and
awakened
with
dawn
there
was
nothing
for
breakfast
but
there
had
been
nothing
for
a
lot
of
breakfasts
and
it
made
little
difference
sooner
or
later
they
would
eat
and
this
morning
it
was
sooner
no
more
than
four
hundred
yards
from
their
camp
they
reached
a
brawling
little
stream
that
raced
frantically
downslope
again
jeff
strung
his
tackle
and
caught
trout
he
laid
them
in
the
grill
and
was
about
to
build
a
fire
when
pal
growled
it
was
a
sound
so
soft
that
nothing
more
than
a
few
feet
away
would
have
heard
it
jeff
looked
quickly
at
the
dog
and
glanced
around
the
forest
he
saw
nothing
pal
was
on
all
fours
straining
into
the
wind
and
he
growled
again
again
jeff
found
nothing
leaving
the
pack
and
fish
jeff
stole
to
a
big
pine
about
thirty
feet
away
and
crouched
behind
it
he
whispered
down
pal
lay
down
and
jeff
continued
to
watch
two
minutes
later
he
saw
a
man
coming
through
the
forest
very
tall
and
very
thin
the
man
was
dressed
in
a
shirt
from
which
half
of
the
right
sleeve
was
missing
protruding
from
it
what
could
be
seen
of
his
right
arm
had
been
scorched
by
so
much
sun
that
it
was
almost
black
his
left
sleeve
was
tied
at
the
wrist
as
dilapidated
as
the
shirt
his
gray
trousers
ended
six
inches
above
scuffed
shoes
and
an
expanse
of
naked
leg
showed
that
he
wore
no
socks
a
luxuriant
beard
covered
his
face
and
curly
black
hair
dangled
over
his
ears
and
down
the
back
of
his
head
in
many
parts
of
the
country
jeff
had
seen
other
men
who
might
have
been
this
one
twin
obviously
a
hillbilly
he
carried
a
carbine
as
though
it
were
a
part
of
him
he
lingered
behind
a
pine
about
fifty
yards
from
jeff
pack
and
for
a
full
minute
he
regarded
it
closely
then
making
no
noise
whatever
he
approached
and
prodded
the
pack
with
his
foot
as
he
looked
curiously
at
the
grill
of
trout
jeff
spoke
that
mine
stranger
the
man
whirled
shouldered
the
carbine
and
put
it
down
again
jeff
rose
bristling
his
lips
slightly
lifted
pal
stayed
very
near
pal
knew
what
jeff
could
not
the
man
was
barr
whitney
and
presently
he
spoke
i
goin
to
tetch
it
i
know
that
jeff
had
a
customer
i
can
see
that
you
an
honest
man
but
i
thought
i
better
make
sure
first
right
smart
idea
barr
whitney
looked
swiftly
at
pal
and
glanced
back
at
jeff
his
eyes
revealed
nothing
but
he
kept
the
carbine
down
expecting
a
flow
of
questions
jeff
was
momentarily
disconcerted
when
his
visitor
did
not
speak
jeff
glanced
at
the
knife
on
his
belt
with
a
blade
the
point
of
the
knife
was
thrust
into
a
sheath
and
there
was
a
guard
that
protected
the
cutting
edge
sparkling
keen
the
blade
probably
was
made
out
of
an
old
file
and
fitted
with
an
ingenious
hilt
of
deer
antler
jeff
watched
the
knife
for
only
a
split
second
homemade
it
was
the
work
of
an
artist
and
jeff
knew
of
lowlanders
who
would
pay
a
good
price
for
it
but
he
must
not
let
the
stranger
know
this
barr
whitney
remained
silent
and
jeff
said
nothing
often
it
was
productive
of
the
best
results
to
fit
his
own
mood
to
that
of
a
potential
customer
jeff
flicked
his
pack
open
took
from
it
a
clasp
knife
that
was
almost
a
small
tool
chest
within
itself
removed
the
trout
from
the
grill
and
arranged
them
on
a
slab
of
bark
he
became
absorbed
in
the
grill
opening
the
file
on
the
clasp
knife
he
filed
a
sharp
point
from
the
grill
wire
handle
he
closed
the
file
opened
a
long
pointed
blade
and
cut
the
heads
off
as
he
did
so
he
brushed
the
grill
with
his
trousers
caught
a
loose
thread
which
was
always
kept
purposely
loosened
and
snipped
it
off
with
the
scissors
that
the
clasp
knife
also
contained
carefully
he
worked
with
the
awl
blade
poking
the
cut
thread
back
into
place
barr
whitney
watched
silently
then
said
give
me
leave
to
look
at
it
sure
without
looking
at
the
other
jeff
gave
him
the
knife
he
started
a
fire
laid
the
trout
back
on
the
grill
and
started
cooking
them
jeff
seasoned
the
fish
and
asked
had
breakfast
yup
jeff
gave
half
the
trout
to
pal
and
gravely
stripped
the
flesh
from
his
own
share
he
gave
pal
the
stripped
bones
went
down
to
the
stream
dug
a
handful
of
sand
from
it
and
scrubbed
the
grill
clean
barr
whitney
was
still
opening
and
closing
the
blade
scissors
awl
screwdriver
file
and
fork
that
folded
into
the
clasp
knife
stag
handle
he
spoke
good
knife
yeah
jeff
agreed
how
much
six
dollars
silence
followed
jeff
who
had
guessed
that
barr
whitney
was
as
likely
to
have
six
thousand
as
six
dollars
made
up
his
pack
the
other
spoke
again
you
swap
maybe
for
what
your
rifle
the
other
jumped
as
though
stung
jeff
who
knew
that
it
as
easy
to
trade
a
hillbilly
out
of
his
hand
as
to
separate
him
from
his
rifle
continued
to
work
calmly
the
pack
never
cumbersome
could
be
made
so
when
he
wanted
to
gain
time
barr
whitney
asked
trade
knives
let
see
yours
stripping
the
knife
from
his
belt
barr
handed
it
to
jeff
betraying
nothing
of
what
he
thought
jeff
unsheathed
the
homemade
weapon
it
was
exquisitely
balanced
and
so
finely
made
that
blade
of
steel
and
hilt
of
horn
flowed
into
each
other
as
smoothly
and
as
naturally
as
two
placid
creeks
mingle
their
waters
ordinarily
jeff
was
able
to
do
little
in
towns
and
cities
but
he
could
if
he
had
merchandise
like
this
to
offer
aside
from
being
highly
practical
the
knife
was
a
collector
item
jeff
handed
it
back
guess
not
what
do
ye
want
two
knives
like
that
smirking
faintly
barr
whitney
thrust
a
hand
inside
his
shirt
and
brought
out
the
twin
to
the
first
knife
obviously
he
been
wearing
it
in
a
shoulder
sheath
he
dropped
both
knives
beside
jeff
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
change
in
his
expression
his
eyes
were
gleeful
as
though
he
been
too
sharp
for
a
peddler
and
he
clutched
the
clasp
knife
firmly
jeff
said
in
pretended
disappointment
guess
i
talked
myself
out
of
that
one
guess
you
did
well
i
do
sometimes
which
way
is
smithville
barr
whitney
pointed
down
a
valley
thar
how
far
a
piece
without
further
comment
barr
whitney
turned
and
strode
into
the
forest
jeff
shouldered
his
pack
and
looked
at
pal
the
dog
stood
erect
still
faintly
bristled
as
he
looked
after
the
departing
man
and
jeff
wondered
why
he
shrugged
some
people
just
naturally
roused
a
dog
to
anger
and
it
was
not
important
jeff
started
toward
smithville
ike
had
spoken
highly
of
smithville
and
in
ike
eyes
its
virtue
lay
in
the
fact
that
people
there
minded
their
own
business
what
jeff
had
seen
bore
that
out
hillbillies
were
independent
not
at
all
inclined
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
others
or
to
having
their
own
investigated
scornful
of
anyone
who
wore
an
officer
badge
they
were
quick
to
take
violent
action
if
what
they
considered
their
personal
rights
were
violated
but
usually
they
did
not
bother
those
who
let
them
alone
jeff
strolled
in
the
direction
barr
whitney
had
indicated
somewhere
ahead
lay
smithville
and
barr
whitney
had
given
him
a
completely
new
idea
this
could
not
be
a
wealthy
land
if
the
man
jeff
had
met
was
any
indication
of
its
riches
shut
off
from
the
world
and
with
little
money
the
hill
people
must
of
necessity
do
for
themselves
and
few
of
them
were
satisfied
to
have
everything
slipshod
it
naturally
followed
that
they
would
have
brought
handicraft
to
a
high
perfection
jeff
planned
as
he
walked
seldom
had
jeff
even
tried
to
peddle
in
any
town
larger
than
cressman
in
big
cities
he
could
do
no
business
at
all
but
not
all
of
the
people
in
cities
were
contented
with
the
monotonous
sameness
of
the
stamped
and
stereotyped
products
available
to
them
they
had
lost
the
art
of
handicraft
themselves
but
some
still
appreciated
it
and
were
able
to
pay
for
it
on
the
other
hand
there
was
an
excellent
chance
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
lacking
the
money
to
buy
city
goods
would
be
eager
to
trade
for
them
jeff
began
to
whistle
pal
he
said
happily
maybe
just
maybe
tarrant
enterprises
is
about
to
become
an
even
bigger
business
pal
was
padding
ahead
glancing
from
side
to
side
and
making
eager
little
excursions
into
the
brush
and
forest
this
was
his
country
times
without
number
he
had
walked
through
these
same
woods
with
johnny
blazer
returning
excited
him
he
went
from
a
boulder
to
a
patch
of
brush
and
from
there
to
a
stump
his
tail
wagged
constantly
as
once
again
he
saw
all
the
old
landmarks
that
were
so
familiar
and
so
dear
not
understanding
jeff
wondered
they
came
to
a
foot
path
jeff
followed
pal
down
the
path
not
knowing
where
it
led
but
sure
that
it
would
take
them
somewhere
if
it
did
not
bring
them
to
smithville
it
would
certainly
lead
to
some
house
whose
inhabitants
could
tell
him
exactly
how
to
get
there
and
jeff
was
in
no
hurry
he
was
naturally
footloose
and
the
woods
were
free
jeff
knew
a
mounting
disinclination
to
go
to
smithville
at
once
it
would
suit
him
better
to
camp
in
the
open
again
tonight
the
path
joined
a
road
there
were
wagon
tracks
hoof
prints
and
even
tire
tracks
left
by
venturesome
drivers
of
automobiles
jeff
came
to
a
sure
sign
of
the
latter
a
blown
tire
lying
beside
the
road
and
shook
a
sympathetic
head
he
did
not
share
the
views
of
those
who
proclaimed
cars
a
passing
fad
they
would
be
the
conveyance
of
the
future
if
only
because
they
could
travel
as
far
in
one
hour
as
a
horse
could
in
three
their
many
faults
were
sure
to
be
corrected
pal
frolicked
like
a
puppy
ears
shaking
and
tail
wagging
as
he
bounced
around
with
a
wide
canine
grin
on
his
mouth
when
he
came
to
another
dim
foot
path
leading
out
of
the
woods
he
halted
to
look
inquiringly
back
at
his
master
hesitantly
he
had
not
yet
had
any
assurance
that
jeff
wanted
to
visit
it
he
looked
longingly
toward
johnny
blazer
cabin
wondering
what
pal
wanted
now
jeff
halted
beside
him
the
cabin
was
hidden
by
trees
from
this
distance
no
part
of
it
could
be
seen
then
a
puff
of
wood
smoke
drifted
to
jeff
nostrils
and
the
cabin
betrayed
itself
with
pal
dancing
eagerly
ahead
he
started
up
the
path
fifty
yards
from
the
road
he
came
to
johnny
blazer
cabin
and
halted
uncertainly
the
place
looked
abandoned
of
the
two
windows
he
could
see
a
pane
of
glass
was
missing
from
each
still
smoke
drifted
from
the
chimney
obviously
someone
was
living
in
the
cabin
jeff
knocked
on
the
door
nobody
answered
he
knocked
again
and
when
there
was
no
response
he
walked
in
a
homemade
chair
with
one
broken
leg
lay
upended
on
the
floor
there
were
a
few
broken
dishes
a
stove
scattered
papers
and
dust
wind
blew
through
empty
panes
where
glass
had
been
about
to
go
farther
in
for
a
closer
inspection
jeff
was
halted
by
a
near
hysterical
command
all
right
mister
raise
both
hands
and
raise
high
certainly
jeff
agreed
pleasantly
anything
to
oblige
jeff
raised
both
hands
and
heard
turn
around
he
turned
to
confront
the
yawning
muzzles
of
a
eight
gauge
shotgun
holding
it
and
dwarfed
by
it
but
never
flinching
was
a
boy
who
could
not
possibly
be
more
than
ten
years
old
dan
the
boy
stood
about
ten
feet
away
near
a
wood
stove
behind
which
he
probably
had
been
hiding
when
jeff
came
in
his
clothing
was
rumpled
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
fairly
new
and
not
the
faded
that
were
to
be
expected
on
around
smithville
his
face
and
hands
were
dirty
and
straight
black
hair
that
had
once
been
tumbled
all
over
his
head
jeff
knew
a
surge
of
pity
never
in
hill
or
any
other
country
should
a
stand
so
it
was
not
right
that
any
youngster
eyes
should
spark
with
such
unbridled
fury
or
that
any
child
should
have
the
complete
willingness
to
kill
that
was
so
evident
in
this
one
at
the
same
time
jeff
felt
something
else
the
youngster
had
control
of
himself
and
the
shotgun
did
not
waver
but
taut
lips
seemed
ready
to
tremble
and
tears
lingered
behind
angry
eyes
it
was
as
though
the
boy
had
taken
up
burdens
which
were
far
too
heavy
but
which
he
was
determined
to
carry
even
while
he
longed
for
a
friendly
arm
to
help
him
and
a
sympathetic
ear
to
which
he
might
tell
his
story
and
somehow
in
spite
of
his
anger
quality
was
evident
within
him
jeff
said
gently
put
your
gun
down
son
tell
me
what
you
doing
here
my
pop
dog
jeff
was
astounded
your
pop
dog
that
him
that
buster
hearing
the
name
pal
flattened
both
ears
and
wagged
his
tail
he
looked
at
the
boy
without
going
near
him
jeff
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
i
found
him
a
long
ways
from
here
clear
over
beyond
cressman
uncertainty
stole
some
of
the
boy
fury
you
you
did
that
right
who
are
you
my
name
jeff
tarrant
and
i
a
peddler
put
your
gun
down
well
he
lowered
the
shotgun
two
tears
broke
from
his
eyes
and
he
shook
them
off
with
an
angry
whirl
of
his
head
jeff
extended
his
hand
maybe
you
better
let
me
have
the
gun
it
it
is
loaded
i
did
have
any
money
to
buy
shells
jeff
said
gently
taking
a
bit
of
a
chance
were
you
what
if
pulled
it
on
someone
with
a
gun
that
was
loaded
i
i
do
know
this
is
really
your
dad
dog
i
ought
to
know
him
he
does
seem
especially
happy
to
see
you
i
i
only
saw
him
twice
last
time
a
year
ago
but
it
my
pop
who
are
you
son
dan
blazer
and
where
is
your
pop
dead
dan
said
fiercely
shot
by
those
whitneys
he
whirled
so
that
his
back
was
to
jeff
put
both
grimy
hands
to
his
eyes
and
shook
with
sobs
pal
looked
worried
jeff
strode
swiftly
across
the
floor
knelt
beside
the
sobbing
youngster
gathered
him
up
and
sat
with
him
on
a
homemade
wooden
chair
whose
back
and
seat
were
of
laced
buckskin
laying
his
head
on
jeff
shoulder
dan
sobbed
unrestrainedly
then
he
wriggled
turned
away
quickly
so
that
jeff
could
not
see
his
face
and
slid
to
the
floor
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
that
was
almost
as
dirty
as
his
face
when
he
turned
again
to
jeff
he
was
calmer
cry
baby
he
accused
himself
big
cry
baby
come
here
dan
jeff
said
gently
what
do
you
want
to
talk
to
you
and
i
seen
men
cry
over
a
whole
lot
less
really
the
thought
seemed
a
reassuring
one
really
where
is
your
mother
she
died
when
i
was
when
i
was
just
a
child
he
spoke
quietly
his
mother
had
died
so
long
ago
that
all
pangs
were
gone
i
see
what
were
you
doing
when
these
uh
when
these
whitneys
shot
your
pop
i
was
in
ackerton
dan
named
the
nearest
city
again
jeff
was
surprised
what
were
you
doing
there
pop
sent
me
to
jackson
school
there
said
he
was
a
hill
man
but
he
did
want
me
to
be
one
he
said
there
were
better
things
how
did
you
get
here
walked
dan
answered
did
anyone
try
to
stop
you
a
policeman
did
before
i
was
out
of
ackerton
i
got
away
and
after
that
i
walked
at
night
do
you
have
any
relatives
i
the
only
one
left
in
the
blazer
family
and
i
aim
to
kill
every
danged
whitney
that
way
i
be
sure
to
get
the
one
who
got
pop
jeff
said
drily
nothing
like
being
thorough
you
sure
the
whitneys
did
get
your
pop
they
the
ones
he
fought
most
with
but
he
fought
with
others
too
well
yes
had
we
better
do
a
bit
of
thinking
before
we
shoot
all
the
whitneys
we
why
do
you
want
to
mix
in
i
got
your
pop
dog
have
i
that
gives
me
the
right
it
dan
looked
doubtfully
at
jeff
do
you
really
think
so
certainly
i
think
so
but
let
not
go
off
this
is
going
to
take
a
bit
of
figuring
we
ca
just
wander
around
leaving
corpses
all
over
the
woods
what
would
you
do
find
who
really
shot
your
pop
and
get
him
i
never
thought
of
that
dan
admitted
let
talk
about
it
over
a
good
meal
that
sound
all
right
great
but
i
down
to
corn
meal
mush
tonight
we
have
something
else
jeff
decided
i
was
just
going
in
to
smithville
to
buy
grub
do
you
like
pork
chops
oh
boy
dan
licked
his
lips
but
why
should
you
buy
me
anything
if
we
partners
jeff
said
firmly
we
share
and
share
alike
you
can
understand
that
we
already
sharing
the
cabin
confidence
and
hope
warmed
dan
eyes
he
smiled
and
jeff
reflected
that
that
was
the
way
he
should
always
look
uh
jeff
what
up
do
you
think
you
could
bring
some
shells
for
this
shotgun
on
one
condition
the
gun
is
shot
at
anything
or
anybody
unless
both
of
us
know
about
it
all
right
dan
agreed
pal
went
to
the
door
with
him
jeff
shoved
the
dog
back
shut
the
door
and
struck
into
the
gathering
twilight
he
shook
a
bewildered
head
was
it
a
year
ago
or
only
a
few
days
that
he
had
been
the
footloose
force
of
tarrant
enterprises
why
was
he
burdened
now
with
a
dog
that
few
other
people
wanted
and
a
boy
that
nobody
wanted
very
much
why
had
he
left
both
where
he
found
them
and
accepted
just
his
own
responsibilities
he
shook
his
head
again
and
murmured
to
himself
darn
fool
tarrant
of
all
the
pinheaded
things
you
ever
done
these
take
the
railroad
spike
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
he
could
have
done
otherwise
the
dog
had
helped
him
therefore
the
dog
must
not
be
abandoned
nor
could
jeff
simply
leave
dan
to
any
fate
that
awaited
him
the
only
man
left
in
the
blazer
family
dan
had
walked
all
the
way
from
ackerton
more
than
a
hundred
miles
to
avenge
his
father
he
intended
to
make
sure
he
did
it
by
shooting
all
the
whitneys
and
he
would
die
if
he
raised
the
gun
to
the
first
one
it
was
a
staggering
situation
and
how
should
he
jeff
solve
it
again
jeff
gave
himself
over
to
the
idea
that
first
things
must
be
first
and
walked
into
smithville
it
was
a
small
town
with
perhaps
four
hundred
inhabitants
and
as
nearly
as
there
could
be
such
a
thing
it
was
a
place
where
the
outer
world
intruded
on
the
hills
smithville
was
about
the
streets
were
dirt
and
rutted
but
instead
of
the
log
houses
in
which
hill
families
abode
the
dwellings
here
were
frame
the
smithville
inn
was
largely
a
place
for
those
who
wished
merriment
in
its
louder
forms
and
there
was
one
store
wagons
piled
high
with
logs
offered
mute
testimony
as
to
the
way
the
town
residents
earned
a
livelihood
but
there
were
no
horses
to
be
seen
doubtless
with
night
approaching
the
teamsters
had
stabled
their
draft
animals
jeff
halted
in
front
of
the
store
a
rather
large
building
whose
front
end
consisted
of
numerous
small
panes
of
glass
inserted
in
wooden
frames
there
was
the
legend
abel
tarkman
general
store
and
beneath
it
was
printed
post
office
too
knowing
before
he
did
so
what
he
would
find
jeff
entered
isolated
stores
such
as
this
one
catered
to
all
the
wants
of
many
people
as
a
result
they
had
to
stock
a
little
bit
of
everything
that
was
practical
and
abel
tarkman
store
was
no
exception
counters
stretched
its
full
length
pails
straps
lanterns
and
bits
of
harness
were
suspended
from
rafter
beams
there
was
a
rack
of
hoes
rakes
spades
and
other
garden
tools
but
no
plows
or
harrows
this
was
not
a
farm
community
jeff
saw
a
shelf
of
drugs
a
vast
assortment
of
chewing
and
smoking
tobaccos
a
whole
rack
of
firearms
and
ammunition
a
food
counter
a
dry
goods
counter
and
toward
the
back
a
small
cubby
hole
of
unpainted
lumber
that
was
labeled
post
office
two
other
people
a
stocky
man
with
a
badge
and
a
woman
were
in
the
store
jeff
stood
aside
while
the
proprietor
evidently
abel
tarkman
himself
served
the
woman
a
small
quiet
man
with
an
inoffensive
manner
he
wrapped
the
woman
purchases
and
looked
inquiringly
at
jeff
four
pounds
of
pork
chops
jeff
said
he
ordered
a
dozen
eggs
two
loaves
of
bread
a
slab
of
bacon
two
quarts
of
milk
a
pound
of
coffee
a
peck
of
potatoes
and
mindful
of
the
youngster
at
the
cabin
a
head
of
lettuce
and
a
bunch
of
carrots
to
these
purchases
he
added
a
broom
four
panes
of
glass
to
replace
those
broken
out
of
the
cabin
putty
with
which
to
hold
them
a
lantern
a
gallon
of
kerosene
and
finally
a
half
dozen
eight
gauge
shotgun
shells
i
nothing
but
number
fours
in
eight
gauge
they
do
and
i
want
to
stick
them
in
my
pocket
abel
tarkman
looked
doubtfully
at
the
rest
it
a
lot
to
carry
put
it
in
gunny
sacks
i
manage
tarkman
reached
beneath
the
counter
for
a
gunny
sack
and
said
amiably
fishing
loafing
jeff
answered
nothing
strenuous
staying
long
i
do
know
where
you
staying
blazer
cabin
abel
tarkman
jaw
tautened
and
he
said
no
more
jeff
frowned
it
was
as
though
something
cold
had
crept
between
them
and
why
should
the
mention
of
blazer
bring
that
about
without
speaking
any
more
the
storekeeper
totaled
jeff
bill
on
a
piece
of
brown
wrapping
paper
and
jeff
paid
in
cash
ordinarily
he
have
tried
to
barter
but
though
the
pack
was
full
he
still
had
ideas
about
trading
with
the
hill
people
shouldering
two
gunny
sacks
jeff
left
the
store
the
sun
had
set
but
enough
light
remained
so
that
he
could
see
between
two
houses
and
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
store
jeff
took
the
six
shotgun
shells
from
one
pocket
and
a
knife
from
another
carefully
he
pried
the
wadding
from
each
shell
and
poured
the
shot
out
just
as
carefully
replacing
the
shot
with
bits
of
paper
that
he
tore
from
his
packages
he
the
shells
not
forgotten
was
the
fury
of
which
dan
was
capable
he
had
promised
jeff
that
he
do
no
shooting
on
impulse
but
jeff
wanted
no
accidents
should
dan
encounter
a
whitney
when
he
had
the
shotgun
in
his
hands
jeff
was
reassembling
the
last
shell
when
his
badge
shining
in
the
day
last
light
the
man
he
seen
in
the
store
came
to
and
paused
beside
him
howdy
howdy
my
name
ellis
the
constable
said
bill
ellis
and
i
constable
here
jeff
tarrant
jeff
extended
his
hand
they
shook
and
bill
ellis
asked
you
said
you
staying
at
blazer
cabin
that
right
see
anything
of
a
youngster
thereabouts
you
mean
dan
blazer
yes
he
there
then
i
guess
i
better
walk
out
with
you
and
pick
him
up
poor
little
tad
all
alone
in
the
world
no
he
is
i
taking
care
of
him
bill
ellis
was
suspicious
since
when
jeff
managed
to
sound
more
than
a
little
astonished
did
he
tell
you
all
he
did
was
walk
through
smithville
yesterday
with
a
little
sack
over
his
shoulder
and
a
shotgun
big
a
cannon
in
his
arm
all
he
said
was
that
he
would
meet
somebody
at
the
cabin
i
waited
this
long
to
see
if
he
really
would
jeff
gave
thanks
for
this
bit
of
coincidence
i
met
him
at
the
cabin
and
he
all
right
he
getting
everything
a
youngster
should
have
though
of
course
if
your
official
duties
call
for
so
doing
you
may
take
him
naturally
i
have
to
go
with
him
and
bring
him
right
back
so
there
may
be
a
bit
of
trouble
you
were
going
to
take
him
to
an
orphanage
were
you
where
else
ah
yes
jeff
agreed
where
else
splendid
place
an
orphanage
ideal
for
those
with
no
one
to
whom
they
might
turn
i
got
a
letter
from
some
school
in
ackerton
said
the
kid
left
there
right
after
his
dad
funeral
and
has
been
seen
since
said
they
thought
he
come
here
and
i
should
be
on
the
watch
for
him
an
error
jeff
murmured
why
do
you
write
to
the
school
maybe
i
better
do
that
jeff
urged
how
long
does
it
take
a
letter
to
get
to
ackerton
and
a
reply
back
here
about
a
week
jeff
made
up
his
mind
to
visit
ackerton
before
the
week
was
out
and
maybe
bill
ellis
need
send
his
letter
i
going
to
ackerton
jeff
said
i
bring
written
confirmation
from
the
school
if
you
want
it
well
if
you
going
there
let
leave
it
that
way
jeff
said
quickly
if
you
care
to
check
in
the
meanwhile
you
can
ask
dan
who
killed
his
father
anyway
if
i
knew
he
be
in
jail
have
you
any
ideas
sure
i
have
it
one
of
maybe
or
thirty
people
have
you
questioned
them
how
well
are
you
acquainted
around
here
i
just
got
in
that
explains
it
then
explains
what
your
not
knowing
why
i
have
questioned
or
thirty
people
let
me
tell
bill
ellis
spoke
at
length
of
those
who
lived
in
smithville
and
those
who
abode
in
the
mountains
surrounding
it
the
town
dwellers
with
few
exceptions
were
industrious
people
who
were
glad
to
work
for
the
lumber
company
and
to
accept
a
weekly
pay
check
they
seldom
caused
trouble
those
residing
in
the
hills
were
a
different
breed
they
worked
when
they
felt
like
it
which
was
not
often
and
few
of
them
could
bear
the
yoke
of
a
steady
job
for
more
than
three
weeks
at
a
time
they
did
for
themselves
and
took
their
living
from
the
wilderness
of
late
years
with
hunters
and
fishermen
finding
their
way
into
the
hills
guiding
them
had
become
a
good
source
of
income
but
the
only
reason
the
hill
people
were
willing
to
guide
was
because
they
usually
spent
all
their
time
hunting
or
fishing
anyway
they
made
their
own
laws
lived
by
their
own
code
and
united
only
when
outside
forces
threatened
any
part
of
their
way
of
life
when
they
fought
they
fought
hard
and
often
for
little
reason
for
many
years
a
feud
with
the
whitneys
on
one
side
and
the
paynters
on
the
other
had
raged
it
had
started
of
all
things
over
a
muskrat
stolen
from
jed
paynter
trap
his
own
judge
jury
and
executioner
jed
had
shot
enos
whitney
two
days
later
jed
was
found
with
a
bullet
in
his
head
and
though
everybody
knew
one
of
the
whitneys
had
shot
him
nobody
had
ever
proven
it
finally
with
four
paynters
and
two
whitneys
dead
the
remainder
of
the
paynters
left
the
hills
no
officer
had
ever
proven
anything
one
who
gone
into
the
hills
had
simply
disappeared
bill
ellis
knew
only
that
someone
had
shot
johnny
blazer
but
who
johnny
had
done
well
trapping
hunting
medicinal
roots
and
guiding
and
boarding
hunters
and
fishermen
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
hills
who
would
have
liked
what
johnny
had
and
not
a
man
who
would
have
quarreled
with
him
about
it
but
to
go
into
the
hills
with
wholesale
accusations
would
do
nothing
except
rouse
fury
accusing
or
even
suspecting
whoever
had
not
shot
johnny
would
be
insult
of
the
deadliest
sort
and
inevitably
bring
on
shooting
far
from
being
interested
in
local
quarrels
the
outside
world
seldom
even
heard
of
them
and
little
help
could
be
expected
from
anyone
if
bill
ellis
knew
who
had
shot
johnny
he
would
go
get
him
but
he
had
to
know
and
had
to
have
indisputable
proof
before
he
moved
he
already
done
everything
he
could
and
was
no
nearer
a
solution
than
he
had
been
two
months
ago
jeff
listened
intently
and
realized
that
he
was
hearing
the
truth
if
it
was
more
extreme
than
what
he
already
knew
about
mountain
dwellers
smithville
was
more
isolated
than
any
other
place
he
had
ever
visited
jeff
thought
of
the
youngster
in
the
cabin
dan
blazer
had
attended
a
city
school
but
his
were
hill
blood
and
hill
traditions
he
had
asked
no
one
to
help
him
avenge
his
father
but
vengeance
was
a
point
of
honor
jeff
gritted
his
teeth
dan
was
a
child
it
would
be
the
essence
of
simplicity
using
force
if
necessary
to
place
him
in
an
orphanage
or
make
him
go
back
to
school
but
it
would
solve
nothing
a
boy
now
dan
would
be
a
man
when
he
was
he
be
back
here
in
the
hills
there
would
be
no
forgetting
where
was
johnny
found
jeff
asked
between
here
and
his
cabin
if
you
noticed
a
big
sycamore
right
beside
the
road
he
was
lying
against
the
trunk
who
found
him
couple
of
fellows
from
ackerton
they
were
fishing
back
in
the
mountains
and
they
brought
johnny
here
mike
severance
he
does
first
aid
work
for
the
lumber
company
patched
him
up
and
they
took
him
to
delview
he
died
in
the
hospital
there
bullet
went
right
through
him
where
is
he
buried
in
delview
bill
ellis
narrowed
his
eyes
who
are
you
a
peddler
jeff
answered
honestly
i
thought
i
could
do
some
business
here
you
will
too
now
tell
me
straight
why
that
kid
came
back
i
told
you
he
with
me
we
leave
it
that
way
the
constable
promised
at
least
until
you
bring
word
from
ackerton
but
if
you
have
any
ideas
except
peddling
you
better
get
some
shells
that
are
loaded
with
something
besides
paper
wads
i
think
about
it
bill
ellis
guessed
the
kid
toted
the
gun
does
he
want
the
shells
that
about
it
you
aim
to
watch
him
why
do
you
think
i
giving
him
blanks
why
do
you
bother
with
him
i
an
orphan
myself
i
could
have
used
somebody
to
look
after
me
when
i
was
ten
years
old
for
pete
sake
be
careful
i
keep
that
in
mind
you
know
where
to
find
me
if
you
need
advice
bill
ellis
promised
but
if
you
start
any
ruckus
you
finish
it
i
a
wife
and
two
kids
to
think
about
well
maybe
i
be
seeing
you
pocketing
the
shells
and
shouldering
the
gunny
sacks
jeff
walked
swiftly
back
up
the
road
he
halted
when
he
came
to
the
big
sycamore
it
was
a
monstrous
tree
that
shaded
the
road
and
murmured
gently
as
the
evening
breeze
danced
through
its
branches
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
show
that
a
man
had
died
violently
beside
it
but
a
man
had
died
here
and
jeff
looked
quizzically
at
the
tree
if
it
could
talk
it
probably
could
tell
who
had
killed
johnny
blazer
he
left
the
tree
and
hurried
along
trees
did
not
talk
and
jeff
was
deep
in
thought
until
he
came
to
the
cabin
there
he
brushed
his
frowns
away
and
forced
a
sparkle
back
into
his
eyes
dan
was
a
ticklish
problem
and
like
all
such
he
had
to
be
handled
delicately
there
must
not
be
even
one
wrong
move
jeff
burst
into
the
cabin
with
a
cheerful
poke
the
fire
up
dan
there
pork
chops
for
supper
visitor
sleeping
in
the
same
corner
where
he
had
slept
so
many
times
pal
moaned
softly
and
twitched
his
paws
he
dreamed
that
things
were
as
they
had
once
been
and
that
he
was
hunting
grouse
with
johnny
blazer
pacing
ahead
pal
scented
a
grouse
and
showed
johnny
where
it
was
there
came
the
shotgun
blast
the
dream
faded
and
pal
woke
up
instantly
things
resumed
a
normal
perspective
the
scent
of
jeff
tarrant
filled
the
cabin
and
mingled
with
it
was
the
odor
of
dan
blazer
pal
remembered
meeting
dan
before
every
summer
but
never
for
more
than
ten
days
at
a
time
johnny
had
brought
him
to
the
cabin
for
a
visit
though
pal
liked
all
children
he
saw
only
an
incidental
connection
between
johnny
and
dan
blazer
however
if
only
because
johnny
had
once
welcomed
the
boy
and
jeff
was
now
welcoming
him
pal
was
happy
to
accept
dan
too
and
to
include
him
in
the
select
circle
of
intimates
who
deserved
every
courtesy
next
to
jeff
he
would
respect
dan
though
his
nose
told
him
that
all
was
well
pal
did
not
go
back
to
sleep
at
once
the
dream
had
been
a
very
vivid
one
and
it
brought
a
surge
of
memories
that
were
strengthened
by
being
back
at
his
old
home
the
past
remained
a
puzzle
pal
had
never
understood
why
johnny
had
disappeared
he
still
did
not
understand
and
he
was
troubled
because
of
it
having
a
dog
instinct
for
time
he
knew
that
the
night
was
about
half
gone
and
because
he
was
familiar
with
the
habits
of
humans
he
was
aware
that
jeff
and
dan
probably
would
not
get
out
of
bed
before
sunrise
equally
at
home
in
daylight
or
darkness
pal
had
never
known
why
people
preferred
to
spend
the
night
hours
in
a
cabin
or
shelter
but
he
had
never
questioned
their
doing
so
they
were
humans
he
was
a
dog
therefore
it
always
befitted
him
to
shape
himself
to
their
ways
and
never
even
think
that
they
should
bend
to
his
sometimes
johnny
had
taken
him
out
at
night
to
hunt
coon
and
pal
rather
hoped
that
jeff
would
do
the
same
because
he
liked
to
run
at
night
but
it
would
be
all
right
if
jeff
did
not
after
a
short
time
needing
contact
more
intimate
than
his
nose
offered
pal
rose
and
padded
across
the
wooden
floor
he
ascended
the
steps
walking
quietly
because
experience
had
taught
him
to
be
quiet
pal
existed
to
please
his
master
and
his
whole
life
must
be
shaped
to
that
purpose
there
were
no
delights
which
directly
or
indirectly
were
not
connected
with
that
when
johnny
had
patted
his
head
and
praised
him
pal
had
quivered
with
joy
now
he
reacted
in
the
same
fashion
to
jeff
and
his
life
was
a
full
one
he
ascended
the
steps
walked
to
the
bunks
that
jeff
and
dan
occupied
sniffed
gently
at
each
and
went
back
to
his
place
in
the
corner
he
had
made
doubly
sure
that
jeff
was
still
present
and
that
partially
satisfied
him
but
because
the
dream
and
the
cabin
brought
johnny
back
to
him
he
was
still
able
to
sleep
only
fitfully
pal
recalled
last
night
he
had
been
very
worried
when
jeff
went
away
and
left
him
in
the
cabin
ordinarily
it
would
have
been
routine
for
johnny
had
often
left
him
alone
but
a
great
fear
had
grown
out
of
johnny
death
pal
had
seen
him
leave
and
been
sure
he
come
back
but
he
never
had
now
he
was
fearful
that
jeff
might
not
return
dan
who
understood
had
tried
to
give
him
comfort
he
come
back
do
you
worry
he
come
back
but
pal
would
not
rest
until
jeff
return
and
then
he
was
happy
again
he
wagged
his
tail
because
the
two
in
the
cabin
greeted
each
other
gladly
and
he
drooled
at
the
odor
of
frying
pork
chops
eating
his
share
pal
looked
puzzled
when
dan
started
to
wash
the
dishes
and
jeff
began
to
work
with
the
broom
in
pal
opinion
the
cabin
was
satisfactory
and
he
had
never
understood
the
quirks
of
humans
that
kept
them
forever
doing
something
that
did
not
look
like
fun
and
seemed
unnecessary
but
pal
resigned
himself
to
the
cleaning
up
he
flattened
his
ears
and
retreated
into
a
corner
he
dodged
from
place
to
place
whenever
the
broom
came
near
and
relaxed
in
his
own
corner
only
when
jeff
finally
put
the
broom
down
and
started
replacing
the
broken
window
panes
unoccupied
and
thought
deserted
the
cabin
had
been
rifled
of
many
things
belonging
to
johnny
but
there
were
enough
dishes
and
tableware
left
for
johnny
had
kept
a
great
store
of
it
to
provide
for
his
guests
dan
yawned
and
jeff
sent
him
to
bed
but
the
young
peddler
worked
for
a
long
while
afterward
finally
giving
pal
a
pat
on
the
head
he
too
sought
one
of
the
upstairs
bunks
now
pal
raised
his
head
at
frequent
intervals
he
had
a
great
yearning
to
visit
again
the
sycamore
tree
the
last
place
where
he
seen
johnny
but
the
door
was
locked
if
the
customary
routine
was
followed
it
would
not
be
opened
until
jeff
and
dan
got
up
rising
pal
walked
nervously
around
the
cabin
sniffing
at
all
the
objects
he
knew
so
well
he
went
to
his
corner
and
did
not
leave
it
again
until
dawn
thin
light
turned
the
cabin
black
windows
to
pale
gray
he
heard
a
bunk
creak
as
jeff
moved
and
raised
expectant
ears
for
a
short
interval
there
was
silence
then
came
dan
sleepy
voice
you
awake
jeff
nope
i
sound
asleep
pal
heard
dan
giggle
there
were
various
little
noises
that
accompanied
their
getting
out
of
bed
and
dressing
tail
wagging
happily
pal
met
them
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
went
first
to
jeff
who
gave
him
a
pat
on
the
head
then
he
offered
his
morning
greeting
to
dan
these
ceremonies
complete
he
padded
over
to
stand
in
front
of
the
door
jeff
understood
i
let
you
out
pal
slipped
through
the
opened
door
and
waited
for
a
while
in
front
of
the
cabin
this
was
his
country
but
he
had
not
forgotten
that
it
had
rejected
him
he
had
walked
safely
with
johnny
blazer
but
he
had
been
clubbed
and
stoned
after
johnny
was
no
longer
with
him
the
lesson
had
penetrated
deeply
when
pal
finally
left
the
cabin
he
did
not
go
down
the
path
but
went
at
once
into
the
brush
and
walked
slowly
alone
he
had
better
be
careful
he
stopped
when
he
caught
the
scent
of
a
rabbit
that
was
hiding
in
the
brush
for
a
moment
he
was
tempted
to
chase
it
because
chasing
rabbits
was
fun
but
this
morning
he
had
a
more
urgent
mission
still
walking
slowly
nose
questing
and
ears
alert
he
made
his
way
to
the
road
and
halted
in
some
thick
brush
beside
it
he
would
not
expose
himself
on
the
open
road
until
he
knew
what
lay
ahead
across
the
road
and
up
the
opposite
slope
a
doe
and
fawn
were
feeding
pal
caught
the
faint
odor
of
grouse
and
he
knew
that
a
skunk
had
wandered
that
way
last
night
later
a
fox
had
minced
along
the
nearest
human
scents
were
those
of
dan
and
jeff
and
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
of
that
pal
considered
himself
safe
he
ventured
into
and
moved
slowly
down
the
road
but
as
he
drew
near
the
big
sycamore
he
broke
into
an
eager
trot
it
was
at
the
sycamore
that
he
had
last
seen
johnny
blazer
and
there
that
he
had
lost
all
trace
of
him
now
he
wanted
to
find
if
there
was
anything
he
might
have
overlooked
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
johnny
his
long
search
had
convinced
him
that
his
former
master
would
never
be
found
but
not
forgotten
never
to
be
forgotten
was
his
long
association
with
johnny
his
love
for
him
and
the
good
life
they
had
lived
together
pal
was
going
to
the
sycamore
for
the
same
reason
that
a
human
being
rereads
old
letters
written
by
a
dear
companion
whom
he
will
never
see
again
once
more
he
stopped
to
read
the
wind
currents
and
the
tracks
in
the
road
besides
the
fox
and
skunk
only
jeff
scent
remained
right
there
therefore
jeff
was
the
only
human
who
had
used
the
road
last
night
but
pal
caught
the
fainter
scents
of
smithville
and
the
people
inhabiting
it
they
were
distant
odors
and
no
one
was
coming
he
gave
undivided
attention
to
the
sycamore
winds
had
blown
and
rains
had
fallen
but
johnny
blazer
had
bled
here
and
his
scent
still
lingered
pal
drank
long
and
deeply
of
it
he
made
a
little
circle
as
though
the
scent
should
lead
him
farther
but
it
ended
at
the
tree
and
the
dog
came
back
to
sniff
again
he
moaned
softly
in
his
throat
because
his
affection
for
johnny
had
been
great
but
johnny
scent
ended
where
it
began
at
the
sycamore
about
to
cast
again
pal
halted
in
his
tracks
the
morning
breeze
blew
directly
from
smithville
to
him
and
the
breeze
had
told
him
that
nobody
was
coming
now
that
was
changed
clearly
pal
caught
the
scent
of
pete
whitney
and
he
knew
that
pete
was
walking
up
the
road
the
dog
bristled
but
not
because
he
saw
any
connection
between
pete
and
johnny
disappearance
he
knew
only
that
all
whitneys
were
enemies
and
that
pete
had
been
near
when
johnny
was
hurt
he
crouched
in
the
brush
undecided
for
the
moment
if
he
lay
perfectly
still
pete
probably
would
pass
without
seeing
him
but
as
the
man
drew
nearer
pal
nervousness
increased
he
decided
suddenly
that
he
would
be
safer
with
jeff
pete
was
just
a
short
distance
away
when
pal
cleared
the
road
in
one
bound
and
raced
toward
the
cabin
the
dog
knew
that
he
had
been
seen
but
he
did
not
care
the
one
dangerous
time
had
been
the
fleeting
instant
he
needed
to
cross
the
road
and
that
was
dangerous
only
because
the
road
offered
no
cover
once
in
the
brush
he
could
run
away
from
any
man
he
found
dan
drawing
water
from
the
spring
beside
the
cabin
and
slowed
to
a
walk
because
he
had
run
hard
he
was
panting
he
paused
very
close
to
the
boy
and
looked
nervously
back
toward
the
road
dan
stared
curiously
at
him
what
down
there
he
questioned
what
you
find
pal
the
great
dog
turned
toward
dan
and
wagged
his
tail
as
evidence
of
good
will
but
his
hackles
remained
raised
as
he
accompanied
the
boy
into
the
cabin
the
good
smell
of
frying
bacon
perfumed
the
air
standing
over
the
stove
jeff
looked
around
questioningly
is
that
bucket
a
load
for
you
dan
nah
i
can
carry
it
jeff
grinned
most
boys
were
proud
of
their
physical
prowess
and
he
had
not
offended
dan
by
offering
to
draw
the
water
for
him
he
broke
eggs
into
the
sputtering
skillet
pal
growled
and
jeff
turned
again
to
look
what
ailing
him
i
do
know
he
must
have
smelled
something
he
do
like
when
he
came
up
to
me
he
was
running
pal
knowing
that
pete
whitney
was
coming
toward
the
cabin
retreated
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
stood
still
bristling
he
showed
his
teeth
jeff
was
puzzled
what
the
something
around
dan
said
quickly
he
looked
out
of
the
window
jeff
pete
whitney
coming
eyes
blazing
he
looked
toward
the
shotgun
jeff
saw
and
interpreted
his
glance
remember
we
not
going
off
uh
all
right
jeff
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
man
standing
in
front
of
the
cabin
pete
whitney
clothing
was
slipshod
but
that
alone
did
not
give
him
the
air
he
had
jeff
was
not
able
to
place
it
at
once
there
was
something
about
him
that
should
not
be
something
very
like
a
surly
animal
about
thirty
pete
had
fine
blond
hair
that
seemed
rooted
so
precariously
that
the
slightest
wind
might
blow
it
away
his
unshaven
cheeks
were
covered
with
stubble
pale
blue
eyes
shifted
sideways
and
he
raised
a
foot
as
though
about
to
run
yet
at
the
same
time
it
was
as
though
he
had
no
intention
of
running
as
far
as
jeff
could
see
he
carried
no
firearms
but
he
acted
as
though
he
were
armed
and
doubtless
he
was
mentally
jeff
compared
him
to
the
man
he
had
met
yesterday
that
man
had
also
been
careless
of
his
clothing
and
appearance
but
there
was
a
strength
and
character
in
his
being
that
was
not
evident
in
pete
barr
whitney
was
strong
pete
was
weak
jeff
asked
pleasantly
something
i
can
do
for
you
nao
pete
spoke
with
a
high
nasal
twang
you
live
here
since
yesterday
jeff
said
dan
and
i
are
here
together
i
swan
pete
ejaculated
i
swan
jeff
saw
that
he
was
obviously
frightened
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
would
take
fright
easily
he
might
need
help
are
you
in
trouble
nao
it
jest
that
i
was
passin
up
the
raoad
an
an
he
blurted
out
i
swan
i
saw
johnny
blazer
big
dog
jeff
thought
swiftly
why
should
seeing
johnny
blazer
dog
be
cause
for
such
alarm
he
asked
casually
where
you
see
him
down
thar
on
the
raoad
i
swan
a
dog
jeff
understood
and
relaxed
many
of
the
mountain
people
believed
firmly
in
haunts
spirits
and
witchcraft
and
everybody
around
smithville
had
reason
to
believe
that
pal
must
be
dead
with
an
effort
jeff
concealed
his
amusement
a
man
such
as
this
thinking
johnny
blazer
dog
dead
and
coming
suddenly
upon
him
might
tremble
easily
you
did
see
him
jeff
said
he
here
he
be
for
a
split
second
pete
eyes
lost
their
appearance
and
venom
flooded
them
a
cold
finger
brushed
jeff
spine
any
man
able
to
look
like
that
was
a
dangerous
one
jeff
thought
of
his
pack
and
of
the
shotgun
in
its
corner
then
he
decided
that
he
could
handle
pete
and
meanwhile
there
were
the
amenities
to
be
observed
had
breakfast
nao
come
on
in
and
have
some
pete
shuffled
into
the
cabin
mouth
taut
and
eyes
angry
dan
backed
toward
pal
the
dog
growled
savagely
jeff
eyes
caught
dan
and
he
tried
to
flash
a
warning
he
and
dan
had
a
pact
which
included
no
hasty
or
moves
and
definitely
no
shooting
of
anyone
jeff
spoke
sharply
to
the
dog
stop
it
pal
pal
subsided
and
pete
said
nasally
blazer
allus
him
buster
he
pal
now
jeff
set
a
plate
of
bacon
and
eggs
on
the
table
and
put
bread
and
butter
beside
it
you
may
as
well
start
dan
unable
completely
to
erase
the
anger
from
his
eyes
not
speaking
dan
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
jeff
put
the
bacon
and
eggs
he
had
intended
for
himself
on
another
plate
thoughtfully
he
set
the
plate
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
two
places
away
from
the
furious
dan
here
you
are
whitney
the
name
pete
whitney
i
jeff
tarrant
and
this
is
dan
blazer
yeah
interest
leaped
in
pete
eyes
any
kin
to
john
he
was
my
pop
dan
flared
that
you
know
very
well
dan
mind
your
manners
jeff
remonstrated
putting
more
bacon
and
eggs
in
the
skillet
i
minding
them
he
knows
who
my
pop
was
and
he
knows
me
pete
who
had
been
eating
as
though
finishing
the
meal
was
a
job
he
had
to
complete
in
a
great
hurry
put
his
fork
down
and
bent
over
his
plate
again
jeff
thought
uncomfortably
of
a
hunted
animal
and
though
he
could
not
see
pete
eyes
he
was
sure
that
they
were
once
more
there
was
an
awkward
silence
which
pete
broke
seems
to
me
i
do
mind
a
comin
to
see
john
dan
flared
again
do
you
also
that
my
pop
was
shot
maybe
you
even
know
who
shot
him
dan
jeff
thundered
for
a
few
seconds
pete
lingered
over
his
food
then
it
was
as
though
he
had
thought
out
a
decision
which
had
been
hard
to
make
he
speared
half
an
egg
curled
a
whole
strip
of
bacon
on
the
end
of
his
fork
shoved
everything
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
chew
noisily
nao
he
said
i
would
knaow
who
done
fer
john
dan
upset
jeff
explained
he
did
realize
what
he
was
saying
an
explosive
i
did
too
lingered
on
dan
lips
and
died
there
when
he
caught
jeff
eyes
as
the
latter
turned
to
lift
his
own
breakfast
out
of
the
skillet
pete
nodded
vigorously
likely
likely
do
get
upsot
what
be
ye
doin
here
jeff
said
smoothly
we
represent
tarrant
enterprises
and
came
because
we
thought
we
could
do
some
business
around
smithville
pete
shifty
eyes
found
jeff
pack
peddler
huh
some
people
call
it
that
whar
ye
find
the
dog
over
beyond
cressman
he
made
himself
at
home
with
us
jeff
put
his
own
plate
on
the
table
and
began
to
eat
pete
mopped
up
the
last
of
his
breakfast
with
a
crust
of
bread
plopped
it
into
his
mouth
and
licked
his
fingers
that
done
he
picked
up
the
conversation
where
it
had
been
dropped
take
care
he
ai
take
care
who
is
killed
the
dog
he
turned
right
snarly
after
blazer
was
bill
ellis
a
shot
him
if
he
had
took
a
mind
to
run
away
did
he
hurt
anybody
nao
but
he
had
a
mind
to
pete
leaned
back
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
cleaning
his
teeth
with
his
tongue
he
asked
suddenly
whar
ye
get
the
for
a
moment
jeff
fumbled
but
tarrant
enterprises
had
taught
him
that
it
was
not
a
good
idea
to
be
at
a
loss
long
enough
to
let
anyone
else
think
too
far
ahead
of
him
he
said
glibly
dan
was
farmed
out
to
me
jeff
referred
to
the
common
practice
of
placing
with
accredited
people
who
would
support
them
youngsters
who
had
no
other
place
to
turn
dan
glared
jeff
did
not
look
at
him
pete
whitney
said
you
git
a
smart
lot
of
work
a
if
you
whomp
him
to
it
jeff
next
words
erased
dan
glare
dan
does
need
we
full
partners
aoh
there
was
another
silence
finally
pete
whitney
asked
what
ye
peddlin
what
do
you
need
i
ast
you
cash
or
swap
swap
pete
looked
surprised
that
anyone
should
think
he
had
cash
what
can
you
swap
pete
reached
inside
his
shirt
and
drew
out
a
knife
it
was
much
cruder
than
the
works
of
art
jeff
had
had
from
bart
whitney
but
it
was
sturdy
and
the
blade
jeff
thought
wryly
was
certainly
keen
enough
to
penetrate
anything
that
pete
might
have
reason
to
stab
since
there
was
a
buyer
for
everything
it
stood
to
reason
that
there
would
be
a
buyer
for
pete
knife
jeff
went
to
his
pack
took
out
a
cheap
jackknife
a
compass
and
a
wrapped
parcel
he
extended
the
knife
i
swap
even
for
this
pete
accepted
the
knife
opened
it
tried
the
blade
on
the
back
of
his
horny
hand
and
passed
it
back
nao
that
piddlin
thin
bend
on
rabbit
fur
enjoying
himself
as
he
always
did
when
bartering
jeff
handed
the
compass
over
pete
looked
at
it
puzzled
he
glanced
back
at
jeff
do
it
tell
the
hour
dan
laughed
jeff
explained
it
called
a
compass
see
the
needle
always
points
north
anyone
who
carries
this
can
tell
any
direction
at
all
pete
was
honestly
astounded
you
mean
they
some
what
cai
there
are
some
but
i
thought
you
would
be
one
of
them
he
spoke
admiringly
stressing
the
you
sales
resistance
faded
to
nothing
if
the
seller
while
convincing
the
buyer
that
he
was
much
to
be
admired
could
at
the
same
time
build
up
the
buyer
opinion
of
himself
like
a
good
showman
jeff
had
saved
his
masterpiece
for
last
he
unwrapped
the
parcel
to
reveal
a
cheap
box
whose
exterior
was
stamped
with
gaudy
green
dragons
pete
regarded
it
with
narrowed
eyes
this
jeff
said
smoothly
i
offer
to
very
few
customers
now
if
you
just
keep
your
eye
on
the
box
pete
obliged
bending
so
closely
that
his
face
was
no
more
than
six
inches
from
the
box
jeff
pressed
a
button
the
lid
flew
open
and
a
green
bellows
surmounted
by
a
grinning
clown
head
sprang
up
to
hit
pete
on
the
nose
he
leaped
backward
flung
himself
from
the
table
and
crouched
again
jeff
thought
of
an
animal
but
this
time
it
was
a
beast
of
prey
and
it
was
ready
to
strike
the
jack
that
had
leaped
out
of
the
box
quivered
on
the
table
swaying
this
way
and
that
completely
astounded
pete
regarded
it
for
a
moment
then
sheer
delight
flooded
his
eyes
i
swan
jeff
said
proudly
ever
see
anything
like
that
put
it
back
jeff
pressed
the
jack
into
place
uncertainly
still
a
little
fearful
of
such
magic
pete
came
near
he
extended
a
hand
and
immediately
withdrew
it
do
it
jeff
pressed
the
button
and
the
performance
was
repeated
sure
now
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
pete
picked
the
toy
up
and
looked
at
it
closely
he
pushed
the
jack
down
latched
the
cover
and
pressed
the
button
when
the
clown
head
flew
up
he
tittered
nervously
i
swan
for
that
i
must
have
two
knives
got
but
one
jeff
frowned
the
was
a
cheap
trinket
and
the
knife
was
worth
four
times
as
much
but
pete
considered
the
jack
a
very
valuable
object
and
jeff
hoped
to
do
much
trading
around
smithville
he
did
not
want
to
be
known
for
accepting
the
first
thing
offered
and
besides
that
was
bad
business
it
took
all
the
sport
out
of
trading
have
to
have
something
to
boot
he
said
firmly
i
got
this
from
his
sagging
pocket
pete
took
a
length
of
braided
horsehide
but
it
had
been
so
skillfully
cured
and
so
expertly
braided
that
it
was
strong
as
rope
and
pliable
as
the
finest
cloth
it
would
make
a
wonderful
bridle
rein
but
jeff
said
hesitantly
i
do
know
what
i
use
it
for
fer
tyin
things
well
jeff
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
pete
sprung
the
jack
again
and
again
fascinated
by
this
simple
thing
which
smacked
of
magic
because
never
before
had
he
seen
anything
like
it
then
holding
his
as
though
it
were
eggshells
he
made
the
swift
transformation
from
fascinated
child
to
dangerous
man
stick
to
peddlin
he
said
shortly
and
took
his
leave
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
threat
and
a
warning
and
jeff
knew
it
for
a
moment
he
sat
still
then
got
up
and
strolled
quietly
to
the
window
going
down
the
path
pete
whitney
sprung
the
jack
and
his
tittering
giggle
seemed
again
to
be
heard
in
the
room
granny
absorbed
in
watching
pete
jeff
was
almost
unaware
when
dan
came
to
stand
beside
him
as
pete
disappeared
hidden
by
foliage
he
turned
away
from
the
window
and
came
face
to
face
with
dan
the
boy
cheeks
were
flushed
and
hot
anger
burned
in
his
eyes
both
fists
were
clenched
so
tightly
that
straining
knuckles
showed
white
jeff
said
quietly
come
out
of
it
dan
he
a
whitney
sorry
you
did
shoot
him
i
it
not
that
jeff
i
was
thinking
very
straight
when
i
told
you
i
aimed
to
shoot
all
the
whitneys
it
why
should
a
whitney
be
in
my
pop
cabin
he
was
at
our
door
and
he
was
hungry
well
doggonit
jeff
you
talk
sense
jeff
heaved
an
inward
sigh
of
relief
yesterday
dan
had
not
only
talked
of
killing
every
whitney
but
he
had
acted
fully
capable
of
doing
it
but
yesterday
he
had
been
tired
hungry
and
so
terribly
alone
good
food
and
proper
rest
had
worked
a
change
but
they
had
not
made
him
forget
why
he
was
here
nothing
would
ever
do
that
dan
asked
you
think
we
will
get
him
do
you
get
who
whoever
killed
my
pop
murder
ca
be
hidden
dan
jeff
spoke
with
quiet
forcefulness
if
somebody
really
wants
to
find
it
out
and
we
find
out
we
find
out
then
dan
gritted
his
teeth
we
shoot
jeff
said
nothing
dan
was
too
young
too
angry
and
too
steeped
in
the
traditions
of
the
hills
to
think
of
anything
except
violent
vengeance
rather
than
tell
him
he
was
wrong
jeff
hoped
to
prove
it
when
they
found
whoever
had
murdered
johnny
blazer
and
they
must
find
him
if
dan
tangled
path
was
ever
to
be
straight
again
the
law
could
take
over
jeff
hoped
that
at
the
right
time
dan
would
see
such
a
course
as
the
proper
one
for
the
present
the
less
said
the
better
let
get
the
place
cleaned
up
and
go
out
trading
jeff
suggested
good
jeff
washed
dishes
while
dan
swept
the
floor
and
it
made
no
difference
that
it
had
also
been
swept
last
night
only
those
with
little
regard
for
themselves
were
contented
to
accept
dirty
surroundings
and
one
way
to
keep
dirt
from
accumulating
was
to
clean
often
the
cabin
in
order
jeff
showed
dan
his
pack
each
of
its
numerous
straps
so
adjusted
that
they
opened
at
the
flick
of
a
finger
gave
access
to
one
compartment
and
within
themselves
some
of
the
compartments
were
further
divided
they
were
also
of
various
sizes
obviously
it
was
possible
to
carry
a
vast
number
of
pins
needles
spools
of
thread
in
a
somewhat
small
space
kitchen
ware
of
which
jeff
had
a
considerable
store
naturally
needed
more
room
there
was
a
place
for
bright
ribbons
one
for
candy
and
articles
such
as
spices
and
tea
were
stored
by
themselves
jeff
had
razor
blades
pencils
an
assortment
of
novelties
such
as
the
a
variety
of
small
tools
nails
and
both
wood
and
metal
screws
at
the
rear
reached
by
thrusting
the
hand
through
a
hidden
flap
were
six
more
knives
like
the
one
he
traded
to
barr
whitney
meerschaum
pipes
pocket
watches
and
a
few
other
valuables
that
were
best
kept
where
they
were
not
at
once
available
or
easily
found
jeff
explained
that
he
always
planned
to
carry
as
great
an
assortment
as
possible
with
very
few
large
articles
the
partial
bolt
of
gingham
the
biggest
single
thing
in
the
pack
he
carried
not
because
there
was
much
profit
in
carrying
it
but
because
being
able
to
offer
gingham
often
provided
an
opening
wedge
to
other
sales
when
he
started
he
had
operated
on
a
strictly
cash
basis
and
had
earned
a
fair
amount
of
money
doing
so
then
he
had
discovered
a
great
truth
which
had
its
foundations
in
the
complexities
of
human
nature
no
matter
what
the
article
from
aardvark
whiskers
to
zebra
tails
somewhere
somebody
not
only
wanted
it
but
wanted
it
badly
enough
to
pay
well
on
the
atlantic
coast
jeff
had
picked
up
a
box
of
sea
shells
in
indiana
he
had
met
a
trapper
never
seen
any
sea
shells
and
traded
them
for
a
bundle
of
mink
pelts
taking
the
pelts
to
chicago
he
had
sold
them
to
a
furrier
for
more
money
than
he
might
have
earned
in
two
weeks
peddling
for
cash
though
everything
was
precious
or
at
least
desirable
to
somebody
whoever
had
an
abundance
of
any
kind
of
goods
was
seldom
inclined
to
regard
it
highly
but
though
they
always
sell
for
cash
whoever
offered
something
that
they
wanted
did
not
have
and
would
find
it
difficult
to
get
invariably
made
a
better
bargain
jeff
cited
the
knife
and
thong
he
had
acquired
from
pete
whitney
the
had
cost
fifteen
cents
but
jeff
would
be
able
to
sell
the
knife
for
at
least
a
dollar
and
twenty
cents
and
he
did
not
know
how
much
the
horsehide
thong
would
bring
but
because
pete
thought
the
such
a
treasure
and
never
would
have
been
able
to
get
one
for
himself
he
had
been
cheated
jeff
concluded
with
the
observation
that
peddlers
had
to
recognize
true
value
when
they
saw
it
otherwise
they
would
not
be
able
to
remain
in
business
dan
eyes
sparkled
that
sounds
like
fun
it
has
its
points
jeff
admitted
take
me
in
with
you
for
good
dan
pleaded
i
want
to
be
a
peddler
too
jeff
glanced
aside
he
had
taken
this
waif
under
his
wing
and
could
not
abandon
him
then
he
was
struck
by
the
happy
thought
that
dan
request
gave
him
control
over
his
charge
we
see
he
evaded
the
issue
take
me
i
do
anything
if
you
teach
me
jeff
asked
quickly
can
i
count
on
that
anything
just
ask
me
you
do
exactly
as
i
say
try
it
what
do
you
want
done
jeff
grinned
right
now
let
go
peddling
and
leave
the
shotgun
here
but
you
said
you
do
anything
let
go
jeff
with
an
ease
born
of
long
experience
jeff
slipped
into
the
pack
knowing
that
they
were
going
out
pal
leaped
to
his
feet
and
a
doggy
grin
framed
his
jaws
jeff
closed
the
door
but
did
not
lock
it
the
cabin
had
been
rifled
only
because
it
was
thought
abandoned
known
to
be
occupied
it
was
safe
the
hill
men
might
use
force
to
get
what
they
wanted
or
even
kill
another
man
for
it
but
petty
pilfering
was
beneath
them
the
sun
was
warm
without
being
too
warm
and
a
breeze
fanned
the
cheeks
of
the
pair
of
peddlers
the
smile
was
complete
on
jeff
face
and
laughter
was
in
his
heart
the
horizon
stretched
limitlessly
with
no
end
or
definition
and
good
fortune
was
a
certainty
he
could
be
other
than
happy
where
we
going
jeff
dan
asked
i
do
know
let
follow
our
noses
and
go
where
they
lead
jeff
took
the
first
mule
and
footpath
that
branched
from
the
road
for
he
was
sure
that
most
of
the
people
he
wanted
to
see
would
be
back
in
most
hill
people
preferred
plenty
of
room
and
they
did
not
as
one
hillbilly
had
expressed
it
to
jeff
like
to
be
all
cluttered
up
with
people
skassly
a
week
passes
but
what
three
four
go
by
ranging
ahead
pal
flushed
a
buck
from
its
thicket
chased
it
a
little
way
and
let
it
go
he
returned
to
jeff
and
dan
lingered
to
sniff
at
some
interesting
rabbit
tracks
and
ran
to
catch
up
there
came
a
faint
smell
of
wood
smoke
jeff
sniffed
eagerly
trying
to
determine
the
smoke
origin
and
he
thought
with
some
amusement
that
he
was
doing
exactly
as
he
had
told
dan
they
would
do
in
a
very
real
sense
he
was
following
his
nose
and
when
he
came
to
a
path
that
swung
from
the
one
they
were
following
he
took
it
pal
at
his
heels
dan
bringing
up
the
rear
he
walked
fast
in
three
minutes
they
came
to
a
clearing
apparently
without
plan
it
had
been
hacked
out
of
the
forest
it
was
probably
to
follow
the
easiest
cutting
and
a
few
large
trees
had
been
allowed
to
stand
in
it
there
were
many
stumps
a
small
garden
a
mule
that
hung
its
head
over
the
topmost
of
two
strands
of
rusting
wire
and
looked
cynical
and
four
pigs
that
squealed
and
scuttled
into
the
brush
the
barn
that
had
listed
badly
and
seemed
in
immediate
danger
of
falling
was
propped
up
with
saplings
the
house
made
of
timbers
was
very
small
and
very
old
rains
snow
sun
and
wind
had
so
beaten
it
that
it
had
achieved
a
unique
color
all
its
own
and
somehow
it
looked
sad
jeff
knocked
confidently
and
waited
the
door
opened
an
inch
then
another
inch
and
in
the
gloomy
interior
jeff
saw
not
too
well
a
scowling
face
that
was
framed
in
a
veritable
haystack
of
black
hair
and
beard
but
he
saw
very
clearly
the
sinister
snout
of
a
rifle
that
was
aimed
squarely
at
his
middle
and
he
heard
very
clearly
a
growled
git
goin
an
start
now
right
away
jeff
agreed
he
whirled
and
started
back
to
the
main
path
too
to
speak
dan
trotted
at
his
heels
and
he
dared
say
nothing
until
they
were
once
more
where
they
had
started
from
then
gee
he
breathed
were
you
scared
no
jeff
answered
wryly
my
heart
always
pounds
do
you
think
he
did
want
us
around
i
had
a
slight
suspicion
what
do
we
do
now
find
somebody
else
jeff
said
cheerfully
it
part
of
peddling
the
day
was
too
fine
and
too
sparkling
to
be
ruined
by
any
surly
mountaineer
they
walked
on
feet
winged
and
hearts
gay
jeff
thought
whimsically
that
the
money
he
made
selling
or
trading
was
the
very
smallest
part
of
the
reward
he
received
by
far
the
major
portion
lay
in
walks
just
like
this
in
the
fact
that
he
loved
the
work
he
was
doing
and
in
trying
to
anticipate
what
lay
ahead
he
always
tried
to
build
up
a
mental
picture
of
his
next
customer
always
failed
to
do
so
and
invariably
had
to
discard
his
approach
to
create
a
new
one
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
much
of
the
time
he
knew
the
sort
of
house
in
which
his
next
prospect
would
live
but
nothing
in
his
experience
had
prepared
him
for
the
house
they
found
not
a
mile
from
the
one
they
had
left
rounding
a
bend
they
saw
a
little
hill
there
was
nothing
majestic
or
imposing
about
it
for
it
was
a
very
small
hill
but
it
was
a
very
beautiful
one
it
was
as
though
the
creator
of
the
mountains
after
much
deliberation
had
decided
that
the
little
hill
would
fit
nowhere
except
exactly
where
it
was
all
the
trees
save
one
had
been
stripped
from
the
side
jeff
and
dan
could
see
and
the
grass
growing
there
was
so
green
and
soft
that
it
was
almost
unreal
the
one
tree
gave
it
just
the
right
touch
so
it
was
as
though
this
hill
were
something
out
of
fairyland
a
little
herd
of
sheep
cropped
the
grass
delighted
jeff
let
his
gaze
stray
upward
gee
but
it
pretty
dan
breathed
it
is
that
jeff
agreed
look
at
the
house
there
were
trees
on
the
very
top
of
the
hill
silhouetted
against
the
blue
sky
they
seemed
to
be
outlined
against
a
gentle
sea
a
log
house
nestled
in
the
grove
something
at
first
jeff
thought
it
must
be
the
whitewash
that
outlined
all
the
windows
and
then
he
knew
it
was
not
set
the
house
apart
like
the
hill
it
was
a
fairyland
house
and
jeff
knew
that
they
must
visit
there
the
hill
rose
in
undulating
waves
with
no
harsh
angles
or
uncouth
lines
to
mar
it
but
it
was
not
a
perfection
some
person
or
persons
must
have
expended
enormous
labor
to
make
the
hill
look
as
it
did
but
every
line
every
patch
of
grass
seemed
to
belong
naturally
just
where
it
was
jeff
could
decide
only
that
this
was
a
happy
hill
and
that
whoever
lived
in
the
house
was
either
the
owner
of
a
rare
talent
or
blessed
beyond
belief
by
the
angels
or
perhaps
some
of
both
they
came
to
the
house
and
marveled
it
was
made
of
logs
and
chinked
with
clay
but
nothing
haphazard
had
gone
into
its
making
even
the
chinking
was
not
just
slapped
on
and
troweled
in
but
flowed
in
graceful
lines
as
though
it
had
always
been
part
of
the
logs
as
old
as
the
cabin
they
had
left
the
house
had
a
sheen
instead
of
a
sad
and
aged
appearance
whoever
lived
here
must
love
it
greatly
howdy
boys
the
woman
came
around
the
house
so
silently
and
so
unexpectedly
that
for
a
moment
jeff
was
startled
the
top
of
her
head
reached
scarcely
to
his
shoulder
her
silver
hair
glowed
like
a
halo
but
there
was
something
which
was
far
from
angelic
in
the
remarkable
eyes
that
dominated
her
unusual
face
she
wore
a
simple
blue
dress
highlighted
in
silver
an
in
flight
adorned
the
front
of
it
her
movements
were
quick
and
graceful
but
there
was
no
suggestion
of
frailty
and
the
muzzle
loading
rifle
that
swung
easily
from
her
right
hand
might
have
been
a
strong
man
weapon
without
any
hesitation
pal
went
forward
to
receive
her
caress
in
a
sudden
rush
of
feeling
jeff
forgot
his
amazement
and
felt
entirely
at
home
he
knew
all
at
once
that
everything
and
everybody
was
welcome
on
this
hill
and
howdy
to
you
granny
he
said
graciously
i
jeff
thought
of
introducing
himself
as
tarrant
enterprises
but
did
not
i
jeff
tarrant
and
this
is
dan
blazer
her
head
flitted
like
a
bird
and
i
granny
wilson

remembered

an

cressman

you
now
ike
one
of
my
boys
what

he
doin
he
was
jeff
fumbled
darned
if
i
have
forgotten
her
laugh
was
like
rippling
water
he
was
in
jail
for
chickens
you
can
say
it
jeff
it
takes
all
kinds
to
make
a
family
my
tommy
a
doctor
my
joel
a
lawyer
my
billy
a
sailor
she
named
four
more
sons
all
of
whom
were
in
some
useful
occupation
and
finished
they
all
followed
their
natural
bent
and
ike
just
naturally
took
to
chicken
stealin
she
turned
to
dan
you

to
johnny
blazer
dan
said
bashfully
he

my
pop

invited

and

milk
i
vow
i

his
kin

jeff
and

jeff
looked
at
the
rifle
have
you
been
hunting
land
no
she
laughed
i
was
shootin
at
brant
severance
you
did
hit
him
she
said
did
aim
to
hit
him
just
wanted
to
show
him
he
could
pester
my
sheep
but
is
there
she
anticipated
and
forestalled
his
question
nope
i
all
alone
my
boys
they
want
me
to
come
with
them
land
i
grow
old
and
shrively
in
a
city
two
houses
are
one
too
many
do
come
in
granny
opened
the
door
that
was
made
of
boards
and
adorned
with
an
excellent
wood
carving
that
depicted
a
running
buck
chased
by
wolves
jeff
and
dan
breathed
their
delight
except
for
the
stove
the
pots
and
pans
that
hung
behind
it
the
lamps
and
a
few
other
articles
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
fashion
with
hand
tools
every
bit
of
furniture
had
been
made
of
whatever
materials
were
available
but
whoever
made
it
had
not
been
contented
with
something
merely
useful
strict
utility
had
received
consideration
but
beauty
was
in
vast
abundance
jeff
looked
through
a
large
window
that
faced
the
back
and
saw
a
neat
garden
a
little
grove
of
fruit
trees
a
fat
mule
a
brown
cow
and
a
cat
sitting
on
a
stone
it
was
exactly
the
big
fluffy
white
cat
that
should
have
belonged
in
such
a
place
not
until
he
took
a
second
glance
did
he
realize
that
the
cat
was
not
alive
at
all
but
woven
into
a
tapestry
he
went
nearer
stretched
on
a
walnut
frame
the
tapestry
was
so
exquisitely
woven
that
the
cat
every
hair
not
only
showed
but
was
in
the
right
place
the
cat
was
about
to
lick
a
front
paw
and
even
after
he
knew
it
was
a
tapestry
so
real
was
the
illusion
of
life
that
jeff
extended
a
hand
to
see
if
the
cat
might
not
be
soft
and
warm
he
turned
to
granny
who
did
this
she
was
all
gentleness
i
did
that
my
kitty
cat
dead
these
four
months
there
was
longing
in
her
voice
and
more
than
a
hint
of
sadness
and
jeff
knew
that
the
cat
had
meant
a
great
deal
to
her
he
understood
some
people
loved
horses
some
preferred
dogs
and
some
set
their
affections
on
cats
but
for
granny
it
could
not
be
just
any
cat
jeff
asked
do
you
do
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
land
yes
a
body
ought
to
keep
busy
jeff
said
gently
i
think
you
kept
busy
a
long
while
around
here
years
the
seventh
of
may
she
said
pertly
came
as
a
bride
enos
god
rest
his
soul
has
been
gone
these
past
three
years
you
two
come
on
into
the
kitchen
she
led
them
into
the
kitchen
seated
them
opened
a
trap
door
in
the
floor
took
cool
milk
from
an
chamber
and
lifted
a
tray
of
gingerbread
from
a
cabinet
eighty
years
old
her
movements
were
almost
as
brisk
and
sure
as
a
girl
jeff
and
dan
ate
heartily
any
food
they
prepared
for
themselves
could
not
possibly
compare
with
this
granny
seated
herself
companionably
near
ike
say
when
he
was
gettin
out
she
asked
well
no
he
was
there
with
bucky
jeff
snapped
his
fingers
i
forgot
his
last
name
bucky
edwards
she
furnished
land
he
and
ike
been
stealin
chickens
for
a
span
of
time
jeff
sensed
something
completely
fine
she
was
old
in
years
only
until
the
day
she
died
her
mind
would
be
young
and
strong
ike
escapades
probably
did
hurt
her
but
ike
was
as
much
her
son
as
the
doctor
the
lawyer
and
the
others
who
had
decided
in
favor
of
respectable
careers
she
would
not
deny
him
jeff
said
ike
and
bucky
did
seem
to
have
any
definite
plans
they
have
some
she
assured
him
they
come
here
and
when
they
do
there
be
a
heap
of
trouble
she
stopped
suddenly
as
though
she
had
said
something
unwise
when
do
you
expect
them
jeff
asked
do
rightly
know
maybe
soon
maybe
not
so
soon
for
a
moment
jeff
was
silent
and
dan
was
still
stuffing
gingerbread
into
his
mouth
granny
had
spoken
of
trouble
when
ike
came
but
apparently
it
was
not
trouble
for
herself
and
if
she
wanted
him
to
know
more
about
it
she
would
have
told
him
he
wished
he
could
offer
her
help
but
he
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
she
knew
how
to
help
herself
he
was
trying
to
think
of
a
way
to
steer
the
conversation
away
from
ike
when
granny
relieved
him
of
the
necessity
for
so
doing
what
you
peddlin
she
asked
brightly
jeff
fidgeted
the
contents
of
his
pack
for
the
most
part
were
designed
for
those
who
had
little
jeff
tried
to
please
people
who
yearned
after
a
bit
of
gay
ribbon
a
new
knife
anything
they
might
need
or
desire
but
could
not
get
for
themselves
but
he
could
imagine
what
granny
lacked
and
countered
her
question
with
one
of
his
own
where
do
you
get
your
thread
and
yarn
she
looked
surprised
spin
it
myself
to
be
sure
i
have
sheep
i
grow
flax
too
jeff
followed
up
because
he
was
interested
do
you
also
make
your
own
dyes
land
yes
be
a
sin
to
let
the
yarbs
go
to
waste
when
they
grow
right
at
the
door
step
do
you
use
anything
besides
herbs
bark
seeds
nut
husks
and
shells
it
all
here
take
a
bit
of
this
a
bit
of
that
a
bit
of
another
thing
seethe
it
and
there
a
dye
i
know
you
do
your
own
weaving
land
yes
jeff
grinned
ruefully
for
the
first
time
since
its
founding
tarrant
enterprises
had
reached
a
blind
end
something
for
everyone
was
one
of
its
numerous
slogans
but
he
did
not
have
anything
for
granny
wilson
and
he
was
honest
about
it
granny
i
do
believe
i
can
offer
you
a
thing
oh
come
now
you
must
have
somethin
but
i
have
now
jeff
you
jest
open
that
pack
and
give
me
a
look
for
myself
i
do
that
much
jeff
laid
his
pack
on
the
table
and
opened
every
compartment
granny
reached
for
a
skein
of
gray
yarn
she
tested
it
with
her
fingers
murmured
poorly
poorly
and
handed
it
back
granny
ignored
the
bright
ribbons
had
no
time
whatever
for
the
knickknacks
lingered
over
a
packet
of
needles
and
her
eyes
were
accusing
when
she
gave
them
back
young
man
you
are
a
poor
shakes
of
a
peddler
i
tried
to
tell
you
i
had
anything
you
want
you
should
have
somethin
to
please
a
poor
old
woman
i
know
if
i
had
anything
good
enough
for
you
oh
darn
a
skein
of
yarn
tumbled
out
of
the
pack
and
caught
on
a
buckle
jeff
reached
through
the
slit
for
one
of
the
knives
opened
the
scissors
and
carefully
snipped
the
tangled
wool
off
granny
clapped
joyful
hands
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
give
me
that
jeff
handed
her
the
knife
granny
eyes
shone
just
the
thing
she
cried
ecstatically
just
what
i
need
my
eyes
ai
what
they
used
to
be
i
missed
two
shots
at
runnin
bucks
last
fall
and
i
forever
mislayin
my
necessaries
be
handy
to
have
so
many
in
one
piece
cash
or
swap
jeff
said
recklessly
let
call
it
a
gift
granny
but
she
was
honestly
troubled
you
ca
give
me
aught
that
cost
you
dear
yes
i
can
not
by
my
leave
she
said
firmly
it
only
right
that
a
body
gets
his
worth
i
swap
even
for
a
look
at
some
of
your
other
tapestries
my
what
your
cloth
pictures
like
the
cat
land
i
get
some
she
bounced
from
her
chair
bustled
into
an
adjoining
room
and
they
heard
her
open
a
trunk
a
moment
later
she
was
back
with
two
tapestries
under
her
arm
she
spread
one
a
yard
long
by
about
twenty
inches
wide
and
jeff
gasped
it
was
last
but
instead
of
following
conventional
patterns
granny
had
drawn
inspiration
from
the
life
around
her
jesus
and
his
disciples
were
seated
at
a
wooden
table
that
was
innocent
of
any
adornment
or
finery
whatsoever
but
the
table
was
so
finely
done
that
a
sliver
thrusting
out
from
it
seemed
both
real
and
symbolic
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
that
rose
above
mere
human
dignity
and
the
dyes
had
been
applied
with
a
touch
so
delicate
that
holy
light
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
picture
its
message
was
one
of
hope
judas
was
not
to
be
abandoned
do
you
like
it
granny
asked
it
jeff
was
at
a
loss
for
words
it
wonderful
preacher
skiles
thinks
the
lord
ai
right
preacher
skiles
assumes
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
she
laughed
was
not
the
way
he
meant
it
he
thinks
jesus
should
be
sittin
above
the
rest
with
maybe
angels
flyin
at
his
shoulder
it
better
this
way
that
what
i
thought
granny
asserted
the
lord
he
was
above
the
beggars
the
sick
and
those
who
done
wrong
somehow
i
got
to
think
of
him
as
comin
down
to
all
of
us
i
too
this
one
granny
spread
the
other
tapestry
i
call
fall
of
jeff
gasped
again
the
picture
centered
around
the
black
silhouette
of
satan
with
a
background
done
in
delicate
shades
of
red
there
was
about
the
figure
utter
misery
abandonment
and
despair
the
gates
of
hell
which
he
had
not
yet
entered
were
merely
suggested
but
they
were
suggested
so
artistically
that
one
sensed
the
seething
fires
the
complete
torment
that
awaited
dan
looked
and
shuddered
gee
jeff
breathed
why
has
anyone
else
seen
these
granny
enos
she
answered
did
hold
with
hangin
them
on
the
walls
and
i
tried
to
keep
the
house
as
enos
want
it
but
i
knew
enos
mind
kitty
cat
he
he
company
somebody
should
see
them
pooh
who
bother
with
an
old
woman
foolishness
i
would
then
take
them
take
them
for
the
knife
i
wo
do
it
she
seemed
crestfallen
i
did
think
you
would
jeff
said
seriously
it
is
that
these
are
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
they
are
how
much
jeff
hazarded
a
guess
dollars
land
each
jeff
finished
my
land
granny
do
you
trust
me
pooh
i
did
raise
eight
of
my
own
knowin
aught
of
boys
are
these
dear
to
you
i
do
set
much
store
by
enos
never
liked
let
me
take
them
into
ackerton
jeff
urged
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
with
them
there
go
ahead
if
you
a
mind
to
land
meal
time
and
i
have
started
a
thing
for
you
boys
to
eat
ackerton
jeff
awakened
an
hour
before
sunrise
he
raised
himself
on
his
bunk
and
listened
dan
regular
breathing
proved
that
he
still
slept
and
jeff
settled
back
beneath
his
warm
blankets
to
do
some
thinking
in
some
respects
the
trading
around
smithville
had
not
gone
as
well
as
he
had
hoped
it
would
the
hill
men
had
been
eager
for
his
knives
of
many
uses
his
fishing
tackle
his
small
tools
his
nails
and
all
the
bolts
and
screws
he
had
they
had
also
taken
all
the
novelties
but
they
had
spurned
his
inferior
products
because
they
could
make
better
ones
themselves
and
jeff
had
been
able
to
trade
only
one
watch
watches
were
useless
to
those
who
guided
themselves
by
the
sun
the
women
had
been
happy
over
the
gay
ribbons
the
thread
and
yarn
the
pins
and
needles
and
the
bolt
of
gingham
had
gone
in
two
days
it
was
better
and
more
colorful
than
anything
abel
tarkman
stocked
but
the
women
had
wanted
only
a
small
portion
of
his
kitchenware
and
spices
jeff
had
traded
all
his
cinnamon
pepper
tea
and
the
few
other
things
that
could
not
be
found
locally
but
no
hill
woman
would
think
of
offering
anything
at
all
for
what
she
could
find
growing
within
easy
reach
of
her
doorstep
or
was
able
to
produce
in
her
garden
the
candy
had
been
exhausted
by
the
third
day
and
jeff
grinned
at
the
way
it
had
gone
he
had
conceived
what
he
thought
was
the
clever
idea
of
bribing
the
children
with
it
and
he
had
discovered
that
the
older
folks
had
a
sweet
tooth
too
never
to
be
forgotten
was
grandpa
severance
sucking
a
striped
peppermint
stick
with
toothless
jaws
however
in
other
respects
trading
had
far
exceeded
jeff
fondest
hopes
though
the
hill
people
had
rejected
some
of
his
wares
they
had
been
willing
to
pay
well
for
what
they
did
want
jeff
and
dan
had
visited
their
cabins
or
met
them
on
the
trails
for
news
that
a
peddler
rather
trade
than
sell
was
abroad
had
penetrated
into
the
remotest
valleys
jeff
had
a
dozen
hunting
knives
whose
quality
ranged
from
fair
to
superb
there
were
three
exquisitely
balanced
hatchets
a
wonderfully
polished
hunting
horn
a
set
of
fine
miniatures
made
of
deer
antler
a
fringed
buckskin
shirt
four
pairs
of
superior
moccasins
and
other
articles
including
an
ancient
matchlock
pistol
still
in
working
order
granny
wilson
tapestries
remained
his
biggest
prize
jeff
knew
that
beyond
any
doubt
his
week
work
had
paid
him
more
than
any
previous
month
but
he
knew
also
that
he
would
have
to
get
trade
goods
that
conformed
to
the
hill
people
idea
of
what
they
wanted
therefore
in
order
to
get
new
stock
and
dispose
of
the
wares
he
had
a
trip
to
ackerton
was
necessary
that
presented
a
problem
dan
had
traveled
with
him
all
week
far
from
lagging
his
interest
in
trading
had
heightened
so
far
dan
had
kept
his
promise
and
had
done
as
jeff
said
but
by
the
fastest
route
it
would
take
a
full
day
to
go
to
ackerton
a
full
day
to
return
and
jeff
thought
that
he
would
need
at
least
four
or
five
days
in
the
city
what
would
dan
do
if
jeff
were
not
there
to
restrain
him
the
boy
had
never
forgotten
that
a
blood
feud
had
brought
him
back
to
smithville
dan
bunk
rustled
and
he
whispered
jeff
i
here
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
awake
as
it
usually
did
when
he
needed
it
most
happy
inspiration
came
to
jeff
i
awake
all
right
and
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
sure
jeff
i
going
to
ackerton
today
and
i
may
be
gone
a
week
or
more
i
want
you
to
take
pal
and
go
up
to
watch
over
granny
wilson
but
she
needs
somebody
jeff
urged
you
and
i
have
stopped
in
there
almost
every
day
and
kept
an
eye
on
her
we
ca
just
leave
her
alone
dan
said
reluctantly
all
right
jeff
can
i
take
the
shotgun
you
just
better
his
problem
neatly
solved
jeff
relaxed
when
dan
announced
that
he
had
been
assigned
as
her
protector
granny
in
her
wisdom
would
accept
him
as
such
if
he
should
get
out
of
hand
the
shotgun
shells
were
loaded
with
nothing
but
paper
they
make
a
satisfactory
noise
but
hurt
anybody
jeff
prepared
their
breakfasts
they
cleaned
the
cabin
and
with
the
shotgun
over
one
shoulder
the
unwilling
pal
with
his
free
hand
dan
started
for
granny
wilson
pack
on
his
shoulder
jeff
strode
into
smithville
there
were
two
routes
to
ackerton
the
hard
one
was
over
the
mountains
the
easy
one
was
eighteen
miles
down
the
logger
road
to
delview
where
a
train
could
be
boarded
and
jeff
chose
that
way
he
walked
swiftly
anxious
to
make
time
but
even
as
he
walked
he
filed
in
his
mind
the
locations
of
the
cabins
he
either
passed
or
saw
evidence
of
there
were
vast
possibilities
for
trade
around
smithville
so
far
he
and
dan
had
explored
only
a
small
part
of
it
half
past
twelve
brought
him
to
delview
and
jeff
walked
openly
down
the
street
larger
than
cressman
delview
was
busier
and
jeff
peddling
instincts
cried
for
expression
he
submerged
them
a
city
was
the
only
place
to
offer
the
wares
he
carried
now
jeff
stopped
when
a
policeman
tapped
his
shoulder
are
you
peddling
no
jeff
answered
blandly
just
passing
through
you
come
from
cressman
cressman
i
came
from
smithville
just
thought
i
ask
been
fishing
hunting
jeff
said
gravely
he
grinned
to
himself
and
walked
on
obviously
pop
and
joe
parker
had
sent
word
to
delview
but
just
as
obviously
they
told
the
police
there
to
be
alert
for
a
peddler
accompanied
by
a
huge
dog
on
impulse
jeff
stopped
at
a
drugstore
bought
a
postcard
addressed
it
to
joe
parker
and
wrote
thanks
for
sending
me
to
delview
regards
to
pop
happy
days
he
signed
it
seymour
tarrant
dropped
it
into
a
mail
box
made
his
way
to
the
station
and
bought
a
ticket
to
ackerton
leaving
delview
at
half
past
three
and
stopping
several
times
en
route
the
train
did
not
reach
ackerton
until
a
quarter
to
eight
jeff
bore
the
slow
ride
serenely
for
only
the
unwise
thought
that
they
must
forever
hurry
besides
time
could
always
be
used
to
good
advantage
and
the
slow
train
was
a
opportunity
to
work
out
a
plan
arriving
in
ackerton
jeff
had
a
clear
idea
of
just
what
he
wanted
to
do
there
he
left
the
train
and
made
a
confident
way
through
the
huge
station
he
had
the
pack
on
his
back
because
that
was
the
easiest
way
to
carry
it
and
he
met
the
curious
stares
directed
at
him
with
a
grin
he
was
as
out
of
place
here
as
a
ackertonite
would
have
been
in
smithville
and
he
elicited
the
same
curiosity
but
he
did
not
mind
because
he
had
been
in
cities
before
and
he
would
be
forgotten
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
jeff
questing
eyes
found
a
paper
banner
displayed
above
one
of
the
station
newsstands
hotel
kennard
ackerton
best
he
glanced
at
the
banner
and
followed
a
pointing
arrow
with
taxi
stenciled
on
it
imperiously
he
beckoned
the
lead
cab
and
directed
the
hotel
kennard
the
cabbie
looked
questioningly
at
him
the
kennard
the
kennard
jeff
repeated
and
since
i
know
the
shortest
way
you
might
as
well
follow
it
the
cabbie
shrugged
if
this
traveler
wanted
to
go
to
the
kennard
and
was
able
to
pay
for
the
trip
that
was
his
affair
jeff
relaxed
in
the
back
seat
and
gave
himself
over
to
enjoying
a
sights
sounds
and
bustle
maybe
if
he
were
a
very
wealthy
merchant
instead
of
a
peddler
he
would
enjoy
such
a
place
himself
a
moment
later
he
decided
that
he
would
half
his
fun
lay
in
personal
contact
with
customers
and
there
was
little
that
was
personal
about
city
business
the
cab
halted
at
the
curb
and
the
driver
opened
the
door
just
a
second
jeff
directed
he
glanced
swiftly
at
the
kennard
and
was
satisfied
it
was
in
one
of
the
better
sections
and
the
men
and
women
going
in
and
out
were
proof
enough
that
it
was
if
not
the
best
at
least
one
of
the
best
hotels
thus
jeff
had
the
base
of
operations
that
he
wanted
he
paid
the
cabbie
and
entered
the
hotel
the
lobby
was
plush
with
thick
carpeting
marble
pillars
and
the
usual
quota
of
those
who
were
waiting
or
simply
loafing
in
upholstered
chairs
heads
rose
and
jeff
winked
slyly
at
an
obviously
affluent
man
who
peered
at
him
over
the
top
of
a
paper
embarrassed
the
man
ducked
back
beneath
his
paper
jeff
made
his
way
to
the
desk
first
floor
room
with
bath
he
directed
loftily
i
wish
to
be
away
from
street
noises
and
he
looked
critically
around
the
lobby
i
prefer
the
better
furnishings
the
blasé
clerk
who
had
registered
all
sorts
of
guests
but
few
like
this
took
jeff
measure
with
his
eye
those
rooms
are
five
dollars
a
day
my
good
man
i
asked
for
a
room
not
advice
ye
the
clerk
was
still
suspicious
but
he
was
also
there
to
rent
rooms
yes
sir
overnight
only
my
stay
is
indefinite
jeff
signed
the
register
with
a
flourishing
jeffrey
tarrant
accepted
the
key
and
gave
his
pack
over
to
a
bellboy
who
led
him
down
a
corridor
he
examined
the
room
as
he
entered
displayed
a
dollar
bill
flipped
a
quarter
and
said
to
the
bellboy
bring
me
a
city
directory
will
you
yes
sir
the
bellboy
left
knocked
discreetly
a
few
minutes
later
handed
jeff
a
bulky
directory
and
jeff
tipped
him
a
dollar
he
washed
and
careless
of
the
glances
he
attracted
enjoyed
a
good
dinner
in
the
dining
room
then
he
returned
to
his
room
on
the
bed
opened
the
directory
laid
a
pencil
and
sheet
of
paper
on
it
and
began
to
run
his
finger
down
the
columns
he
came
to
barnerson
joseph
dlr
antqes
grand
and
wrote
the
information
on
his
sheet
of
paper
jeff
noted
five
more
dealers
in
antiques
six
sporting
goods
stores
and
six
shops
chosen
at
random
which
from
their
listings
seemed
to
cater
to
exclusive
trade
that
done
he
referred
to
a
city
map
in
the
same
book
and
drew
a
line
through
whatever
did
not
seem
to
be
in
one
of
ackerton
better
districts
the
first
phase
of
his
campaign
was
outlined
jeff
rang
for
the
evening
papers
and
read
until
he
was
too
sleepy
to
read
any
more
from
force
of
habit
he
awoke
at
dawn
but
turned
over
and
went
back
to
sleep
the
hill
people
began
their
day
with
the
first
light
but
he
was
in
a
city
now
jeff
awoke
again
at
eight
breakfasted
and
made
his
way
to
the
street
he
wandered
down
it
and
entered
the
first
clothing
store
he
found
i
want
a
business
suit
he
told
the
clerk
who
accosted
him
this
way
sir
the
clerk
tried
to
read
jeff
thought
he
succeeded
and
brought
out
a
suit
that
had
been
in
style
fifteen
years
ago
and
probably
in
storage
since
jeff
rose
with
a
curt
do
you
have
any
new
suits
oh
sorry
sir
my
error
he
fitted
jeff
with
a
neat
blue
serge
suit
a
white
shirt
a
modest
but
smart
tie
a
pair
of
socks
and
new
shoes
jeff
took
his
old
clothes
back
to
the
kennard
wrapped
one
of
barr
whitney
knives
thrust
it
into
his
inside
coat
pocket
and
went
out
his
trap
was
set
and
scented
now
he
had
to
see
if
he
would
catch
anything
there
were
four
sporting
goods
stores
still
on
his
list
but
jeff
passed
the
first
because
its
windows
were
dirty
and
the
second
because
it
advertised
a
bargain
sale
but
the
third
seemed
to
offer
what
he
wanted
he
asked
the
friendly
clerk
who
came
forward
is
ryerson
in
no
he
is
but
calworth
is
may
i
see
him
this
way
jeff
followed
the
clerk
down
the
aisle
and
examined
the
store
closely
as
he
did
so
the
fire
arms
fishing
tackle
and
other
sporting
equipment
displayed
on
the
counters
was
all
of
quality
make
and
he
had
been
asked
for
an
appointment
so
evidently
this
store
catered
to
sportsmen
able
to
afford
the
best
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
overly
formal
the
clerk
ushered
him
into
an
office
and
jeff
hopes
rose
calworth
the
clerk
said
this
gentleman
wants
to
see
you
my
name
tarrant
jeff
shook
calworth
extended
hand
jeff
tarrant
and
i
hoped
you
be
kind
enough
to
furnish
me
with
some
information
sit
down
mr
tarrant
calworth
was
and
a
sprinkling
of
gray
showed
in
his
black
hair
but
there
was
a
sparkle
in
his
eyes
an
ease
of
movement
and
callouses
on
his
hands
obviously
he
did
something
besides
sit
at
a
desk
and
jeff
guessed
shrewdly
that
he
was
an
outdoor
enthusiast
himself
jeff
took
the
proffered
chair
and
draped
himself
carelessly
but
not
too
carelessly
upon
it
i
represent
tarrant
enterprises
jeff
almost
added
the
but
caught
himself
in
time
we
may
wish
to
expand
are
you
in
sporting
goods
partly
and
you
considering
ackerton
yes
and
no
that
what
i
hope
to
decide
there
plenty
of
room
mr
tarrant
but
how
much
room
calworth
laughed
i
tell
you
frankly
there
are
a
variety
of
sporting
goods
stores
but
ryerson
and
hapley
split
per
cent
of
the
trade
and
ninety
per
cent
of
the
most
desirable
trade
however
there
is
no
reason
why
an
aggressive
newcomer
should
not
do
very
well
jeff
bent
forward
is
there
a
survey
oh
purposely
arranged
to
do
so
the
knife
in
his
pocket
had
slipped
and
thrust
the
front
of
his
new
coat
outward
grinning
his
embarrassment
jeff
took
the
knife
from
his
pocket
and
balanced
it
on
his
knee
calworth
eyes
followed
his
movements
what
do
you
have
there
one
of
our
specialties
jeff
gave
him
the
knife
a
rather
exceptional
piece
calworth
slipped
the
knife
from
its
sheath
and
his
eyes
warmed
as
he
examined
it
he
tested
the
blade
with
his
thumb
and
shaved
a
couple
of
hairs
from
the
back
of
his
hand
when
he
turned
to
jeff
he
was
interested
you
specialize
in
this
sort
of
thing
we
specialize
in
quality
jeff
said
casually
when
we
sell
we
like
to
believe
that
the
customer
receives
full
value
do
you
get
many
articles
as
good
jeff
shrugged
look
at
it
can
that
be
no
calworth
admitted
what
is
your
retail
price
on
this
knife
twenty
dollars
jeff
said
firmly
when
do
you
intend
to
open
your
branch
mr
tarrant
i
not
sure
we
will
open
it
at
least
we
wo
until
after
much
more
extensive
research
would
you
care
to
make
ryerson
your
agent
until
you
decide
definitely
jeff
deliberated
then
i
had
thought
of
an
agency
it
ca
hurt
you
and
it
might
make
you
some
money
i
continue
to
be
frank
this
is
not
something
to
offer
an
average
customer
because
he
simply
can
not
afford
it
but
there
are
sportsmen
who
can
and
they
come
to
ryerson
we
take
this
and
any
other
quality
merchandise
you
have
at
a
thirty
per
cent
discount
jeff
thought
of
barr
other
knife
a
few
of
the
rest
the
hatchets
the
bridle
reins
and
made
a
swift
calculation
not
all
were
equally
valuable
but
all
were
quality
if
ryerson
paid
him
cash
he
would
more
than
make
up
for
everything
he
had
dispensed
from
his
pack
his
train
fare
his
expenses
in
ackerton
and
he
would
still
have
valuable
goods
he
said
finally
it
should
work
to
our
mutual
benefit
may
we
expect
some
more
soon
calworth
asked
i
have
a
few
in
my
sample
case
at
the
kennard
you
may
have
those
as
soon
as
i
time
to
deliver
them
and
more
in
shall
we
say
three
weeks
i
send
a
clerk
for
what
you
have
calworth
promised
and
leave
your
check
at
the
kennard
desk
or
would
you
prefer
payment
to
your
business
headquarters
jeff
held
his
breath
inwardly
but
answered
quite
casually
it
matter
we
leave
it
at
the
kennard
calworth
decided
what
should
the
total
be
jeff
made
a
swift
mental
calculation
barr
whitney
two
knives
for
twenty
dollars
each
one
almost
as
good
for
fifteen
two
for
ten
and
three
for
five
dollars
each
pete
horsehide
thong
for
four
dollars
and
the
three
hatchets
at
five
dollars
each
that
less
thirty
per
cent
jeff
gave
the
total
dollars
and
thirty
cents
good
jeff
knew
that
this
keen
man
would
examine
each
article
and
see
if
the
price
was
suitable
are
you
going
back
to
the
kennard
i
must
stop
in
for
a
few
minutes
may
i
send
someone
along
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
the
things
certainly
fine
do
forget
us
mr
tarrant
jeff
walked
back
to
the
kennard
with
one
of
ryerson
clerks
gave
him
the
merchandise
intended
for
him
in
the
lobby
and
got
a
receipt
then
he
returned
to
his
room
looked
over
the
motley
collection
of
knives
that
remained
and
decided
that
he
could
sell
or
trade
them
to
his
advantage
but
he
wanted
to
take
care
of
some
of
the
other
articles
first
and
then
give
special
attention
to
granny
tapestries
he
examined
the
pistol
and
the
set
of
miniatures
both
were
unknown
quantities
about
a
foot
long
the
pistol
had
a
metal
barrel
and
ivory
handles
that
had
faded
to
a
soft
yellow
on
each
handle
was
an
elaborate
boar
head
nat
stancer
who
had
traded
jeff
the
pistol
for
two
screwdrivers
had
kept
it
in
good
working
order
jeff
did
not
know
how
much
it
was
worth
but
certainly
it
would
be
of
use
only
to
a
hill
man
or
to
someone
interested
in
antiques
the
miniatures
were
small
but
well
carved
and
proportioned
and
all
of
them
consisted
of
deer
in
various
stages
and
poses
there
were
a
doe
and
fawn
a
running
buck
a
lone
fawn
three
grazing
does
a
resting
buck
and
a
doe
rearing
they
had
cost
jeff
a
yard
each
of
red
blue
and
yellow
ribbon
but
the
woman
who
had
traded
them
had
not
done
the
carving
the
miniatures
were
also
old
and
jeff
thought
they
had
probably
been
fashioned
by
some
invalid
with
nothing
else
to
do
the
pistol
in
one
side
pocket
and
the
miniatures
in
another
jeff
set
out
to
visit
the
antique
dealers
whose
names
and
addresses
he
had
listed
with
no
experience
in
antiques
he
had
only
a
vague
idea
as
to
how
to
go
about
selling
his
so
he
took
the
dealers
in
alphabetical
order
and
the
first
name
on
his
list
was
joseph
barnerson
he
entered
the
store
a
narrow
building
sandwiched
between
two
larger
ones
and
looked
curiously
at
the
objects
surrounding
him
jeff
recognized
few
and
wanted
none
but
looking
at
them
strengthened
his
own
conviction
that
no
matter
what
the
article
might
be
it
was
desirable
to
somebody
jeff
turned
toward
the
man
who
came
to
meet
him
he
had
half
expected
somebody
old
and
creaking
but
this
man
was
only
about
thirty
and
far
from
decrepit
what
may
i
do
for
you
i
have
an
old
pistol
jeff
said
and
maybe
i
sell
it
if
i
got
the
right
price
the
man
smiled
mister
i
sell
antiques
i
do
not
buy
them
you
do
where
do
you
get
your
stock
then
the
smile
became
a
grin
i
get
my
merchandise
in
my
own
way
let
me
see
your
pistol
jeff
handed
it
over
the
man
examined
it
closely
and
finally
said
they
a
drug
on
the
market
i
give
you
fifty
cents
in
that
case
wrap
up
six
for
me
i
give
you
three
dollars
for
where
would
i
get
six
you
said
they
a
drug
on
the
market
so
the
man
admitted
are
most
other
antiques
their
value
depends
on
how
badly
somebody
wants
them
find
somebody
who
wants
the
pistol
and
you
get
a
fair
price
to
somebody
who
does
want
it
it
is
worth
a
penny
that
makes
sense
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
find
somebody
who
wants
it
but
though
jeff
visited
other
dealers
in
antiques
none
offered
him
more
than
a
dollar
for
the
pistol
and
nobody
offered
anything
for
the
miniatures
it
was
very
late
when
he
returned
to
the
kennard
mighty
mission
in
his
room
at
the
kennard
jeff
slept
late
the
past
four
days
had
been
busy
ones
and
more
than
a
little
hectic
and
he
was
tired
calworth
himself
had
brought
back
three
of
the
cheapest
knives
admittedly
they
were
worth
five
dollars
each
but
they
were
not
merchandise
that
ryerson
could
sell
to
its
more
exacting
customers
if
they
were
to
pay
premium
prices
they
demanded
premium
quality
and
ryerson
had
better
knives
in
stock
that
they
sold
for
four
dollars
and
a
half
however
calworth
had
softened
their
return
by
taking
the
fringed
hunting
shirt
the
four
pairs
of
moccasins
and
the
polished
hunting
horn
and
privately
jeff
kicked
himself
for
failing
to
offer
them
in
the
first
place
they
had
brought
dollars
and
ryerson
would
take
all
jeff
could
supply
if
the
quality
remained
as
good
the
pistol
was
also
gone
failing
to
sell
it
to
anyone
at
the
price
he
wanted
to
get
jeff
had
carelessly
left
it
on
his
dresser
the
maid
who
tidied
up
the
room
had
found
it
decided
that
only
a
desperate
outlaw
would
use
such
a
thing
and
taken
to
it
the
clerk
unable
to
resolve
a
situation
so
grave
and
unwilling
to
take
the
responsibility
the
clerk
had
consulted
the
manager
and
the
manager
had
come
to
see
jeff
he
apologized
for
his
employees
but
thought
that
they
had
been
well
intentioned
he
also
recognized
the
pistol
and
it
just
so
happened
that
his
hobby
was
collecting
antique
fire
arms
if
jeff
cared
to
sell
the
pistol
jeff
did
for
fifteen
dollars
jeff
had
tramped
the
streets
going
from
store
to
store
and
bartering
it
had
taken
time
but
bit
by
bit
he
had
rid
himself
of
almost
everything
he
had
brought
to
ackerton
and
stocked
his
pack
with
items
the
hill
people
favored
none
of
it
had
cost
jeff
any
money
and
in
addition
to
all
expenses
he
had
a
clear
profit
of
almost
a
hundred
dollars
under
ordinary
circumstances
that
would
have
been
excellent
but
these
circumstances
were
not
ordinary
he
had
been
unable
to
find
a
buyer
for
either
the
miniatures
or
granny
wilson
tapestries
though
it
revolted
his
peddler
instincts
to
do
so
he
was
willing
to
keep
the
miniatures
if
it
took
too
much
time
to
sell
them
not
only
did
he
refuse
to
do
so
with
granny
tapestries
but
he
was
determined
to
settle
for
nothing
less
than
the
price
he
had
assured
granny
he
could
get
however
at
least
for
the
moment
he
had
reached
a
stalemate
jeff
had
visited
every
store
that
seemed
to
have
a
wealthy
trade
but
the
most
expensive
tapestry
he
had
been
shown
cost
twelve
dollars
and
fifty
cents
and
he
had
even
bothered
to
show
granny
jeff
turned
over
opened
his
eyes
sat
up
yawned
and
occupied
his
mind
with
the
problems
of
the
day
the
smile
remained
on
his
lips
and
his
eyes
retained
their
sparkle
the
fact
that
he
had
had
no
success
with
the
tapestries
proved
only
that
he
had
not
yet
offered
them
to
the
right
person
they
were
a
challenge
and
it
was
a
challenge
to
which
he
could
rise
if
he
had
permitted
himself
to
be
discouraged
by
every
small
setback
he
would
have
stopped
peddling
long
ago
he
dressed
breakfasted
and
lingered
over
his
plate
to
ponder
the
problem
of
the
tapestries
naturally
one
did
not
walk
up
to
any
stranger
ask
him
if
he
needed
an
expensive
tapestry
and
proceed
to
sell
him
one
but
there
had
to
be
a
way
because
there
was
always
a
way
what
way
jeff
tried
his
best
to
come
up
with
an
answer
and
could
do
it
he
still
had
no
intention
of
leaving
ackerton
until
the
tapestries
were
sold
jeff
fell
back
on
the
idea
that
first
things
must
be
first
and
he
still
had
more
to
do
in
ackerton
maybe
something
would
occur
to
him
while
he
was
doing
it
he
went
to
his
room
referred
to
the
directory
found
the
jackson
school
for
boys
noted
its
address
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
tucked
one
of
granny
tapestries
last
under
his
arm
before
he
left
the
hotel
far
from
doing
so
only
once
opportunity
was
always
knocking
and
jeff
thought
that
many
people
missed
her
visit
only
because
they
were
unprepared
when
she
was
all
but
hammering
the
door
from
its
hinges
jeff
took
a
taxi
across
town
there
were
trolleys
but
he
acquainted
himself
with
their
schedules
and
besides
taxis
were
faster
now
that
time
was
a
factor
he
wanted
to
finish
his
business
and
return
to
smithville
he
could
not
afford
to
loiter
jeff
looked
interestedly
at
the
section
of
the
city
they
were
entering
downtown
ackerton
was
crowded
with
land
so
precious
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
space
at
all
between
buildings
even
the
more
modest
residential
areas
had
houses
close
together
and
a
bit
of
yard
in
front
and
back
this
must
be
where
the
wealthy
element
lived
the
houses
were
large
and
set
back
from
the
streets
by
ackerton
standards
the
lawns
were
very
spacious
though
all
of
them
together
would
have
offered
a
hill
dweller
as
much
room
as
he
needed
they
came
to
an
area
where
there
were
no
residences
at
all
but
only
a
few
business
places
and
jeff
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
one
that
interested
him
the
display
windows
were
clear
but
drapes
hung
behind
them
and
jeff
thought
he
saw
a
tapestry
displayed
he
memorized
the
name
the
murchison
galleries
the
cabbie
turned
aside
into
a
paved
drive
and
halted
his
taxi
beside
a
large
building
that
had
a
distinct
air
of
gentility
the
taxi
stopped
and
jeff
looked
puzzled
i
wanted
the
jackson
school
this
is
it
jeff
paid
the
driver
got
out
and
looked
around
obviously
a
converted
mansion
the
jackson
school
had
none
of
the
aloofness
of
the
mansions
they
had
passed
surrounded
by
green
lawns
and
flower
gardens
there
was
the
same
strong
sense
of
being
welcome
that
was
so
evident
on
granny
wilson
hill
jeff
whistled
johnny
blazer
who
had
lived
in
a
cabin
behind
smithville
had
stinted
himself
when
he
chose
a
school
for
his
son
jeff
knew
a
little
misgiving
it
was
his
intention
to
see
dan
back
here
when
the
school
term
opened
but
could
he
afford
it
might
as
well
find
out
he
murmured
to
himself
inside
the
main
entrance
a
pleasant
girl
looked
up
from
a
desk
upon
which
was
a
typewriter
an
inkwell
with
a
tray
of
pens
and
a
few
papers
she
smiled
at
jeff
yes
i
like
to
see
jeff
tried
and
could
not
think
of
the
titles
given
officials
in
private
schools
for
boys
he
grinned
i
like
to
discuss
a
youngster
who
probably
would
be
in
the
sixth
grade
is
he
a
student
here
yes
i
call
nelson
will
you
be
seated
please
she
talked
into
a
speaking
tube
jeff
seated
himself
on
a
comfortable
divan
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
he
approved
of
the
man
who
came
in
about
fifty
years
old
he
was
short
and
inclined
to
stoutness
he
wore
a
gray
suit
that
fitted
well
and
had
been
chosen
with
care
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
hair
but
the
blue
eyes
that
set
his
face
off
were
gentle
understanding
and
wise
jeff
rose
to
meet
him
mr
nelson
yes
sir
his
voice
was
soft
and
pleasant
my
name
jeff
tarrant
jeff
introduced
himself
i
come
to
talk
to
you
about
dan
blazer
alert
interest
flooded
the
headmaster
face
oh
yes
do
you
know
where
he
is
yes
let
me
tell
you
nelson
listened
attentively
while
jeff
spoke
of
finding
dan
in
johnny
blazer
cabin
jeff
told
of
dan
fierce
anger
and
his
unshakable
determination
to
seek
out
whoever
had
killed
his
father
and
extract
full
vengeance
he
spoke
of
his
own
part
in
it
and
of
the
shotgun
shells
jeff
did
not
try
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
a
peddler
nor
did
he
hide
dan
interest
in
peddling
he
told
of
his
own
hopes
to
find
johnny
murderer
let
the
law
take
its
course
and
of
the
effect
he
thought
that
would
have
on
dan
for
a
moment
after
he
finished
nelson
did
not
speak
then
he
asked
where
is
the
boy
now
i
left
him
in
very
good
hands
he
will
lack
for
nothing
nelson
looked
troubled
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
him
mr
tarrant
if
i
can
afford
it
i
want
to
bring
him
back
here
when
the
fall
term
opens
nelson
smiled
gently
tarrant
when
you
looked
up
the
jackson
school
for
boys
i
sure
you
saw
nothing
about
our
being
restricted
to
wealthy
boys
only
we
do
have
students
and
i
admit
that
they
are
of
exceptional
ability
who
pay
whatever
their
parents
or
guardians
can
afford
where
does
dan
rate
in
that
category
very
highly
very
highly
i
assure
you
an
outstanding
youngster
but
your
revelations
were
not
a
complete
surprise
you
expected
him
to
run
away
i
took
him
to
his
father
funeral
nelson
said
softly
he
said
little
but
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
after
he
ran
away
i
wrote
to
the
authorities
in
smithville
but
i
had
no
reply
that
my
fault
jeff
admitted
i
told
them
that
dan
was
under
my
care
and
that
i
contact
you
personally
you
did
by
any
chance
did
you
have
ideas
about
looking
us
over
i
had
that
idea
and
i
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
come
back
if
you
did
not
measure
up
oh
we
do
meet
your
standards
jeff
smiled
you
good
enough
you
might
have
brought
dan
with
you
i
might
also
have
put
him
in
a
cage
jeff
said
wryly
and
if
i
kept
him
there
for
one
three
or
ten
years
he
get
out
some
time
when
he
did
he
still
go
back
and
hunt
whoever
shot
his
father
how
old
are
you
mr
tarrant
going
on
nineteen
would
it
be
impertinent
to
ask
your
background
jeff
said
quietly
i
lived
in
an
orphanage
until
i
was
a
little
past
fourteen
then
i
ran
away
and
worked
at
various
jobs
since
quitting
the
last
one
i
been
a
peddler
i
see
and
what
do
you
hope
to
gain
by
sending
this
youngster
back
to
us
jeff
still
spoke
quietly
sleep
easy
sleep
at
night
because
i
did
not
leave
him
alone
when
he
had
no
one
else
to
whom
he
could
turn
what
does
dan
think
about
it
i
have
told
him
jeff
grinned
but
i
have
a
pact
with
him
dan
has
agreed
to
do
anything
i
say
why
he
likes
peddling
and
he
has
an
idea
that
he
going
to
throw
in
with
me
i
told
him
he
could
unless
he
minded
me
what
are
your
plans
for
the
future
i
have
decided
jeff
said
seriously
but
i
like
smithville
and
if
things
continue
to
get
as
well
as
they
started
out
in
the
next
three
or
four
years
i
be
able
to
build
up
a
good
business
right
in
smithville
i
see
do
you
have
any
ideas
about
dan
in
with
you
yes
i
do
jeff
confessed
i
like
him
and
i
like
to
have
him
tarrant
and
blazer
would
be
a
mighty
good
team
but
first
he
must
have
an
education
why
so
he
know
what
i
have
never
learned
i
read
as
much
as
i
can
but
that
not
as
good
as
solid
groundwork
in
school
if
you
pay
for
his
education
would
you
insist
on
his
later
services
no
he
can
choose
his
own
way
you
willing
to
be
responsible
for
him
on
such
a
basis
yes
sir
wh
what
is
your
tuition
fee
blazer
paid
nelson
named
half
the
sum
jeff
had
expected
what
do
you
wish
to
have
me
do
i
want
only
your
written
confirmation
that
dan
is
in
my
care
may
i
also
say
that
you
are
to
return
him
to
us
by
september
fourteenth
certainly
all
right
miss
jackson
may
i
borrow
your
desk
the
confirming
letter
in
an
inside
pocket
jeff
strode
happily
out
of
the
school
it
had
all
been
much
simpler
than
he
had
thought
possible
but
nelson
was
an
understanding
person
jeff
knew
that
he
himself
had
undergone
one
of
the
most
severe
examinations
of
his
life
and
had
passed
it
relieved
about
dan
he
could
now
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
business
at
hand
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
kennard
but
jeff
did
not
want
to
hail
or
phone
for
a
taxi
as
yet
because
the
neighborhood
and
the
stores
he
had
seen
interested
him
he
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come
saw
the
stores
ahead
and
halted
in
front
of
the
murchison
galleries
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
seen
what
he
thought
he
had
seen
and
it
was
there
in
the
window
somehow
accentuated
by
the
very
simplicity
of
its
surroundings
was
a
tapestry
that
depicted
a
bowl
of
crocuses
in
bloom
though
he
did
not
know
a
great
deal
about
tapestries
jeff
realized
that
this
was
a
very
fine
one
but
mentally
he
compared
it
to
granny
and
decided
that
hers
was
better
jeff
entered
the
galleries
though
only
the
arrangement
of
the
interior
loaned
an
illusion
of
spaciousness
and
its
air
was
one
of
quiet
refinement
there
were
paintings
on
the
walls
and
others
on
easels
and
without
examining
them
too
closely
jeff
knew
that
the
way
they
were
placed
added
much
to
their
effectiveness
he
turned
to
meet
the
man
coming
toward
him
and
was
greeted
with
a
pleasant
good
morning
he
said
it
as
though
he
were
welcoming
a
guest
into
his
house
and
jeff
responded
in
kind
good
morning
i
think
you
may
save
my
life
indeed
the
man
arched
his
brows
you
hardly
seem
on
the
verge
of
expiring
i
really
am
though
you
do
know
something
about
tapestries
a
bit
the
man
smiled
indulgently
what
do
you
wish
jeff
unrolled
granny
last
and
held
it
up
for
inspection
i
find
the
exact
duplicate
of
this
may
i
see
it
the
man
took
the
tapestry
felt
its
texture
turned
it
over
and
examined
it
at
arm
length
his
eyes
hardened
ever
so
slightly
lowering
the
tapestry
he
wrinkled
his
brow
in
thought
perhaps
we
may
help
you
tarrant
jeff
supplied
jeffrey
tarrant
i
raold
murchison
you
wish
us
to
find
a
duplicate
of
this
if
you
can
jeff
wanted
dollars
but
decided
he
might
as
well
try
for
more
it
worth
a
hundred
dollars
how
soon
must
you
have
it
mr
tarrant
tomorrow
noon
the
deadline
jeff
said
ruefully
just
think
been
in
ackerton
almost
a
week
before
i
found
you
where
are
you
staying
the
kennard
room
sixteen
may
we
retain
this
until
tomorrow
at
noon
of
course
naturally
you
will
naturally
i
would
not
ask
you
to
leave
it
without
a
receipt
will
you
be
at
the
kennard
at
noon
i
make
it
a
point
to
be
there
i
shall
phone
you
then
tarrant
and
advise
you
concerning
our
success
or
failure
he
gave
jeff
a
receipt
and
noted
his
name
and
room
number
jeff
left
the
galleries
knowing
that
he
had
taken
a
gamble
but
who
hoped
to
win
had
to
take
chances
with
nothing
else
to
do
he
gave
the
rest
of
the
day
and
most
of
the
next
morning
to
wandering
about
ackerton
he
returned
to
his
room
at
twenty
to
twelve
and
exactly
twenty
minutes
later
his
phone
rang
tarrant
it
was
the
desk
clerk
there
a
murchison
here
to
see
you
send
him
in
jeff
opened
the
door
for
raold
murchison
and
no
matter
where
he
stood
he
would
still
be
master
of
the
murchison
galleries
i
came
in
person
tarrant
because
that
seemed
best
indeed
yes
we
succeeded
in
locating
the
exact
duplicate
of
your
tapestry
jeff
gave
thanks
for
his
ability
to
wear
a
poker
face
when
such
was
in
order
if
the
murchison
galleries
had
located
the
twin
of
granny
last
granny
had
made
it
and
raold
murchison
would
even
know
how
to
talk
to
her
murchison
smiled
tentatively
in
the
process
of
finding
the
duplicate
we
also
found
a
customer
who
is
enamoured
of
the
pair
those
things
happen
i
assume
that
you
have
a
customer
who
will
pay
you
at
least
two
hundred
dollars
jeff
made
no
comment
it
was
murchison
privilege
to
assume
anything
he
wished
the
art
dealer
continued
i
am
prepared
to
offer
you
a
hundred
and
dollars
for
yours
jeff
heart
leaped
but
his
face
revealed
nothing
obviously
somewhere
among
his
wealthy
neighbors
raold
murchison
just
as
jeff
had
hoped
had
known
the
exact
person
who
would
appreciate
such
a
tapestry
naturally
he
would
sell
it
for
more
than
the
price
offered
jeff
but
he
was
entitled
to
a
profit
too
hiding
his
elation
jeff
frowned
it
is
the
price
i
thought
i
get
but
you
can
not
sell
yours
without
a
duplicate
jeff
looked
away
without
answering
murchison
waited
expectantly
finally
jeff
looked
back
well
all
right
he
agreed
how
about
taking
another
tapestry
jeff
asked
oh
you
have
another
jeff
showed
him
fall
of
raold
murchison
examined
it
and
turned
to
jeff
a
fair
enough
piece
and
i
speculate
shall
we
say
fifty
dollars
let
say
i
taking
a
chance
but
will
you
accept
my
personal
check
certainly
raold
murchison
wrote
a
check
and
waved
it
in
the
air
until
it
dried
if
you
should
be
in
ackerton
again
tarrant
the
murchison
galleries
are
ever
ready
to
be
of
service
he
left
and
jeff
leaped
high
to
click
his
heels
in
the
air
he
had
hoped
to
get
fifty
dollars
for
both
tapestries
he
had
two
hundred
and
a
strong
hint
that
more
tapestries
would
be
welcome
he
fairly
danced
down
to
the
desk
when
is
the
next
train
for
delview
he
asked
the
clerk
consulted
a
time
table
thanks
jeff
ran
out
on
the
street
and
hailed
a
taxi
the
nearest
place
where
i
can
buy
a
kitten
he
directed
and
stay
with
me
i
want
you
all
afternoon
sure
bub
half
past
four
and
five
pet
shops
later
jeff
found
what
he
wanted
of
three
white
angora
kittens
in
the
window
one
was
almost
the
twin
of
granny
departed
pet
it
watched
jeff
shyly
and
arched
its
back
against
his
hand
then
it
promptly
proceeded
to
bite
his
finger
plainly
it
was
a
kitten
with
character
i
want
it
jeff
told
the
astonished
proprietor
put
it
in
a
cage
or
something
because
it
going
on
the
train
lifted
into
a
bird
cage
the
kitten
spat
its
indignation
and
fell
to
swiping
at
shadows
with
a
silky
paw
jeff
laid
five
dollars
the
requested
price
on
the
counter
and
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
where
the
miniatures
lay
present
for
you
he
said
scattering
them
across
the
counter
he
rushed
to
the
cab
hotel
kennard
and
do
spare
the
gasoline
i
have
to
be
at
the
station
by
he
made
it
with
a
whole
minute
to
spare
bombshell
dan
blazer
going
up
the
trail
toward
granny
wilson
with
the
shotgun
in
one
hand
and
pal
leash
in
the
other
was
a
little
angry
and
more
than
a
little
resentful
though
jeff
had
said
that
dan
was
going
to
take
care
of
granny
the
boy
had
convinced
himself
that
he
was
actually
to
be
taken
care
of
he
resented
it
because
he
and
jeff
had
a
pact
dan
had
promised
to
do
anything
jeff
said
but
jeff
seemed
to
have
forgotten
if
he
wanted
to
stay
at
granny
he
had
only
to
say
so
and
nothing
else
was
necessary
dan
turned
to
pull
the
balky
pal
along
come
on
he
ordered
come
on
pal
jeff
going
to
ackerton
and
he
does
want
either
you
or
me
with
him
pal
who
had
wanted
to
go
with
jeff
but
who
was
beginning
to
get
the
idea
that
he
was
not
supposed
to
stopped
straining
back
on
the
leash
he
was
not
wholly
abandoned
as
he
had
been
when
johnny
went
away
and
that
was
a
comfort
dan
brightened
a
little
jeff
had
not
only
let
him
have
the
shotgun
and
the
six
shells
but
had
insisted
that
he
take
them
the
very
fact
that
jeff
had
trusted
him
with
both
made
him
feel
more
like
a
man
and
less
like
a
little
boy
he
gripped
the
shotgun
tightly
some
day
he
would
look
down
the
rib
that
separated
its
two
barrels
and
see
the
man
who
had
shot
his
father
dan
eyes
flashed
then
softened
that
day
must
not
be
now
he
had
promised
jeff
that
he
would
shoot
anybody
and
jeff
was
very
smart
dan
skipped
along
save
for
the
one
dark
cloud
the
future
glowed
with
bright
promise
jeff
had
promised
to
make
a
peddler
of
him
and
that
would
be
the
ideal
life
dan
thought
of
it
during
his
waking
moments
and
dreamed
of
it
in
his
sleep
all
he
had
to
do
in
order
to
make
his
dreams
come
true
was
obey
jeff
and
that
was
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
reward
it
offered
jeff
was
and
maybe
he
really
sent
dan
to
take
care
of
granny
when
granny
green
hill
came
in
sight
dan
spirits
were
almost
completely
lifted
the
fact
that
he
wished
so
desperately
to
take
a
man
part
helped
convince
him
that
he
was
taking
one
and
he
forgot
his
resentment
to
greet
granny
with
a
smile
good
morning
granny
dan
my
land
where
jeff
gone
to
ackerton
and
he
be
gone
for
some
time
he
dan
hesitated
he
sent
me
and
pal
up
to
look
after
you
while
he
away
granny
reacted
precisely
as
jeff
had
thought
she
would
now
that
was
a
kindly
thought
i
really
miss
a
man
around
the
house
come
in
and
let
me
set
you
a
dish
of
cookies
granny
wholehearted
acceptance
of
himself
and
his
mission
removed
most
of
the
lingering
suspicion
dan
retained
that
granny
was
really
supposed
to
take
care
of
him
he
swelled
with
newfound
importance
and
felt
a
profound
gratitude
toward
jeff
for
sending
him
on
a
man
job
the
cookies
granny
set
before
him
were
tangible
proof
that
taking
care
of
her
would
not
be
without
its
rewards
with
the
appetite
of
a
dragon
and
the
digestion
of
a
goat
and
despite
his
substantial
breakfast
dan
finished
all
the
cookies
and
wished
there
were
more
but
it
would
hardly
be
polite
to
ask
i
can
stay
until
jeff
gets
back
granny
he
said
you
wo
have
to
worry
while
i
here
i
wo
she
asserted
i
just
wo
fret
even
one
particle
it
such
a
comfort
to
have
you
what
jeff
doing
in
ackerton
trading
we
been
working
pretty
hard
and
now
he
has
to
trade
everything
we
got
dan
thought
wistfully
of
jeff
who
in
the
boy
mind
was
nine
feet
tall
and
possessed
all
the
capacities
of
a
wizard
do
all
right
too
those
city
people
they
not
near
as
smart
as
jeff
they
could
be
granny
agreed
solemnly
that
jeff
he
man
all
through
we
partners
dan
said
partners
in
everything
any
of
those
whitneys
been
bothering
you
granny
not
of
late
granny
looked
a
bit
puzzled
why
do
you
ask
about
the
whitneys
because
dan
said
fiercely
one
of
them
shot
my
pop
and
soon
jeff
and
me
find
out
which
one
we
going
to
shoot
him
my
land
how
you
talk
dan
felt
suddenly
that
he
was
a
little
boy
again
and
justly
censured
by
an
adult
for
lack
of
wisdom
he
all
but
blushed
we
not
going
to
do
it
right
away
that
nice
granny
said
now
i
have
to
take
care
of
you
what
needs
taking
care
of
first
you
might
go
see
that
no
pesky
thing
troublin
my
sheep
pal
at
his
heels
dan
raced
down
to
where
the
fat
sheep
were
at
their
endless
task
of
cropping
grass
they
looked
at
him
with
mildly
surprised
eyes
and
continued
to
crop
dan
circled
the
sheep
three
times
petted
the
gentle
creatures
and
was
more
than
a
little
disappointed
because
there
seemed
to
be
no
immediate
need
of
his
protective
services
but
he
did
not
lose
hope
there
was
still
a
lot
of
granny
hill
left
molly
granny
placid
old
cow
and
ephraim
granny
mule
were
as
well
off
as
the
sheep
dan
sighed
then
became
a
little
excited
when
four
blackbirds
winged
out
of
the
trees
to
scratch
in
granny
garden
he
stalked
them
carefully
but
before
he
could
come
near
enough
pal
charged
the
blackbirds
and
sent
them
in
jittery
flight
back
to
the
trees
dan
circled
the
foot
of
the
hill
looking
hard
for
something
from
which
granny
should
be
protected
but
all
he
found
was
a
cottontail
rabbit
that
confounded
the
fleet
pal
by
ducking
into
a
burrow
three
inches
in
front
of
his
nose
dan
wandered
back
to
granny
house
just
in
time
for
lunch
that
consisting
of
bread
much
softer
and
better
than
any
abel
tarkman
sold
butter
strawberry
preserves
goblets
of
milk
and
a
crisp
apple
turnover
smothered
in
cream
was
better
than
any
dan
had
eaten
even
at
the
jackson
school
for
boys
suddenly
homesick
he
thought
of
the
school
and
all
it
had
meant
to
him
then
put
the
thought
behind
him
he
had
left
the
school
because
he
was
driven
by
a
mission
that
would
not
let
him
rest
and
would
never
permit
him
to
have
peace
until
it
was
fulfilled
until
it
was
he
must
think
of
nothing
else
he
should
even
think
seriously
of
going
peddling
with
jeff
but
he
could
help
that
then
his
faith
restored
itself
jeff
was
and
jeff
had
promised
him
that
justice
would
be
done
dan
was
a
bit
ashamed
of
his
doubts
unable
to
swallow
another
bite
he
pushed
his
plate
back
and
lingered
over
it
granny
who
had
had
a
hungry
boy
to
satisfy
in
far
too
long
was
shaping
an
apple
pie
at
the
table
and
dan
eyes
lingered
on
her
the
big
wood
stove
cast
a
pleasant
glow
into
the
room
and
tantalizing
odors
promised
much
to
come
dan
licked
his
lips
the
faint
beginning
of
fresh
hunger
rising
on
the
very
heels
of
the
meal
he
had
just
eaten
dan
wrinkled
his
brows
he
had
been
sent
to
look
after
granny
and
look
after
her
he
would
but
she
did
seem
to
need
any
right
now
and
the
forest
surrounding
the
hill
was
an
inviting
place
he
asked
is
everything
all
right
granny
land
it
right
as
rain
since
you
got
here
have
felt
this
safe
in
a
dog
age
would
you
still
feel
safe
if
pal
and
me
went
down
in
the
woods
this
afternoon
can
you
beat
that
i
was
just
about
to
ask
you
if
you
would
what
you
goin
to
do
there
dan
look
around
and
make
sure
nothing
lurking
too
near
good
good
if
you
can
spare
the
time
you
might
bring
a
few
trout
for
us
to
sup
on
oh
boy
dan
whooped
from
his
chair
with
pal
bustling
at
his
heels
he
ran
out
to
the
garden
he
loved
to
fish
his
father
had
taught
him
how
to
catch
trout
and
granny
accustomed
tackle
a
hook
and
line
tied
to
a
willow
pole
hung
over
the
door
in
the
spring
damp
overflow
dan
grubbed
until
he
had
filled
his
pocket
with
fat
worms
then
he
snatched
the
pole
from
over
the
doorway
and
raced
down
to
the
little
stream
that
from
the
hilltop
wound
like
a
silver
ribbon
through
the
forest
he
strung
a
worm
on
his
hook
crawled
cautiously
up
to
a
pool
and
dropped
the
worm
gently
watching
with
bated
breath
the
ripples
that
spread
a
trout
surged
from
the
depths
struck
viciously
and
dan
drew
his
wriggling
catch
in
deftly
he
slipped
it
onto
a
willow
stringer
stringer
in
one
hand
pole
in
the
other
he
sneaked
up
to
another
pool
and
caught
another
trout
mindful
of
the
pies
granny
was
making
he
decided
that
he
needed
no
more
than
two
trout
for
himself
because
his
appetite
must
be
saved
for
more
important
things
granny
might
eat
three
dan
had
four
trout
on
his
stringer
when
pal
growled
hackles
raised
ears
alert
nose
questing
he
peered
dan
stopped
not
knowing
what
was
coming
but
sure
that
pal
would
growl
for
no
reason
dragging
the
dog
with
him
the
boy
slipped
into
the
brush
and
a
moment
later
barr
whitney
appeared
he
was
fishing
too
but
instead
of
a
willow
stringer
he
carried
a
buckskin
creel
into
which
he
slipped
trout
as
he
caught
them
dan
held
his
breath
and
at
the
same
time
did
his
best
to
control
his
rising
rage
he
wished
mightily
that
he
had
brought
the
shotgun
but
so
far
there
had
been
no
indication
that
he
would
need
it
watching
barr
come
nearer
he
made
himself
very
small
if
he
did
not
move
maybe
barr
would
see
him
but
when
the
man
came
opposite
dan
he
swerved
and
splashed
across
the
creek
trousers
dripping
seeming
like
some
wet
monster
that
emerged
from
the
water
he
had
only
a
glance
for
the
growling
pal
but
he
thrust
a
hand
inside
his
shirt
and
the
boy
knew
that
he
had
a
weapon
of
some
sort
concealed
there
dan
quieted
the
growling
pal
by
gently
stroking
him
what
be
ye
doin
here
boy
dan
glared
i
do
talk
to
no
blamed
whitneys
barr
eyes
clouded
mind
your
tongue
boy
i
wo
mind
it
but
one
of
you
whitneys
will
wish
you
minded
yourselves
when
jeff
and
me
find
out
who
killed
my
pop
we
will
yes
you
will
and
me
and
jeff
are
on
the
track
you
be
jeff
image
came
to
stand
beside
dan
so
that
he
no
longer
felt
small
alone
and
so
terribly
frightened
with
his
friend
beside
him
he
could
do
anything
ha
he
exploded
you
think
jeff
a
peddler
but
not
dan
cast
desperately
for
an
apt
description
and
thought
of
the
most
awesome
image
his
mind
could
conjure
up
he
a
policeman
a
real
policeman
now
he
gone
into
ackerton
for
more
policemen
and
soon
he
gets
some
they
get
every
one
of
you
darned
whitneys
you
wait
you
be
sorry
jeff
said
so
barr
whitney
purred
are
you
are
you
going
to
do
anything
to
me
ca
think
of
ary
i
do
mebbe
string
you
on
the
hook
an
use
you
for
bait
no
longer
interested
in
fishing
barr
whitney
splashed
back
across
the
creek
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
immensely
gratified
dan
watched
him
go
he
told
those
whitneys
except
that
the
fluffy
kitten
did
not
like
the
bird
cage
and
expressed
his
dislike
with
frequent
that
attracted
the
attention
of
everyone
else
in
the
day
coach
jeff
trip
from
ackerton
to
delview
was
almost
routine
it
was
not
entirely
so
because
twice
the
conductor
threatened
either
to
take
the
kitten
into
the
baggage
car
or
throw
jeff
and
his
luggage
off
the
train
both
times
a
chorus
of
dissent
rose
from
the
six
other
passengers
in
the
car
the
train
did
not
make
as
many
stops
as
the
one
from
delview
to
ackerton
had
but
it
was
equally
slow
and
the
kitten
provided
diversion
when
they
finally
reached
delview
the
kitten
stood
erect
and
glared
at
everything
in
sight
obviously
he
was
a
creature
of
great
character
and
he
would
fit
in
perfectly
on
granny
hill
pack
on
his
back
and
the
caged
kitten
dangling
from
his
right
hand
jeff
strode
down
delview
main
street
he
had
decided
as
he
usually
did
to
guide
himself
by
whatever
circumstances
seemed
to
require
if
he
felt
too
tired
he
would
put
up
at
one
of
delview
two
hotels
overnight
but
the
events
of
the
day
particularly
his
astounding
success
with
tapestries
had
roused
him
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
so
high
that
he
was
not
at
all
tired
the
night
was
ideal
for
walking
and
jeff
made
up
his
mind
to
go
right
through
to
smithville
he
should
get
there
some
time
in
the
early
morning
hours
he
was
anxious
to
see
dan
again
and
to
watch
granny
eyes
when
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
with
her
tapestries
he
was
hungry
but
the
first
café
he
entered
was
one
of
exclusive
eating
places
and
the
late
diners
who
still
lingered
there
stared
in
horror
at
the
caged
kitten
a
waiter
asked
him
to
leave
and
jeff
did
not
feel
like
arguing
the
point
the
second
café
not
so
pretentious
and
presided
over
by
a
fat
man
with
a
completely
bald
head
and
a
clean
apron
was
less
particular
jeff
laid
his
pack
down
put
the
cage
on
a
chair
and
ordered
steak
fried
potatoes
and
coffee
heavy
on
all
three
and
a
saucer
of
milk
for
the
kitten
sure
bud
sure
the
fat
man
poked
a
pudgy
finger
at
the
kitten
who
crouched
in
the
cage
and
evidently
imagined
himself
unseen
he
sprang
suddenly
and
when
he
leaped
against
the
cage
door
it
burst
open
the
kitten
slithered
through
jumped
to
the
table
gave
everything
in
the
restaurant
a
haughty
look
scrambled
to
jeff
shoulder
and
began
to
purr
contentedly
cute
lil
feller
the
fat
man
said
admiringly
why
do
you
keep
him
caged
jeff
saw
opportunity
the
cage
had
been
only
a
means
for
getting
the
kitten
from
ackerton
to
granny
but
if
the
kitten
preferred
shoulder
he
was
welcome
to
ride
there
the
fat
man
was
obviously
interested
in
the
cage
usually
i
do
jeff
admitted
i
got
the
cage
to
bring
him
through
from
ackerton
he
added
as
though
it
were
an
afterthought
thing
cost
me
two
dollars
need
the
cage
any
more
i
do
know
my
wife
been
lookin
for
such
she
keeps
birds
what
you
take
for
it
jeff
forsook
bargaining
his
pack
was
full
and
since
the
kitten
seemed
happy
on
his
shoulder
he
did
not
want
to
carry
the
cage
to
smithville
swap
for
the
dinner
it
a
swap
the
fat
man
who
apparently
was
also
the
cook
went
into
the
kitchen
he
came
back
with
a
platter
containing
a
huge
steak
and
an
ample
supply
of
potatoes
he
also
had
a
mug
of
coffee
that
held
at
least
a
pint
the
kitten
scrambled
from
jeff
shoulder
to
the
table
top
turned
up
his
nose
at
the
saucer
of
milk
placed
before
him
and
looked
appealingly
at
jeff
steak
jeff
grinned
this
kitten
knew
what
he
wanted
and
was
willing
to
try
for
it
jeff
fed
him
a
small
piece
of
steak
then
another
and
a
third
only
when
jeff
firmly
refused
to
give
him
any
more
did
he
turn
and
lap
up
every
bit
of
the
milk
when
it
was
time
to
go
he
climbed
back
on
shoulder
and
pressed
his
naked
nose
and
pads
against
his
friend
neck
where
they
would
stay
warm
jeff
walked
swiftly
through
the
cool
night
stopping
every
hour
or
so
to
rest
he
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
dawn
was
faint
in
the
sky
when
they
came
to
smithville
and
rising
and
stretching
on
jeff
shoulder
the
kitten
greeted
it
with
a
hearty
who
there
it
was
the
constable
bill
ellis
jeff
tarrant
jeff
called
i
been
waiting
for
you
even
though
the
constable
was
only
there
was
about
him
a
great
hesitation
that
was
mingled
with
a
certain
furtiveness
as
he
came
through
the
darkness
jeff
waited
more
than
a
little
surprised
bill
ellis
came
nearer
and
whispered
where
you
been
why
ackerton
the
kitten
miaouwed
again
and
bill
ellis
took
a
backward
step
that
just
a
kitten
that
i
bringing
to
granny
wilson
there
was
vast
urgency
in
bill
ellis
voice
as
he
said
do
go
there
turn
around
and
get
out
of
the
hills
do
come
back
why
never
mind
why
just
go
i
going
to
granny
bill
ellis
shrug
was
more
sensed
than
seen
you
got
a
gun
why
no
where
is
it
at
granny
by
the
way
here
the
letter
from
the
school
he
took
the
letter
from
an
inside
pocket
and
handed
it
over
bill
ellis
accepted
it
but
it
seemed
unimportant
if
you
wo
run
he
said
get
to
granny
and
get
your
gun
while
darkness
lasts
do
go
anywhere
again
without
it
but
do
as
i
say
and
there
was
a
definite
note
of
fear
in
bill
voice
do
tell
anybody
i
told
you
he
turned
and
walked
swiftly
away
as
though
the
peddler
had
suddenly
become
an
outcast
or
tainted
being
with
whom
he
must
not
have
further
contact
jeff
stood
a
moment
completely
bewildered
why
this
unexpected
warning
what
had
come
into
the
hills
since
he
left
for
ackerton
why
was
bill
ellis
afraid
jeff
called
softly
bill
the
constable
waited
jeff
trotted
to
him
tell
me
some
more
i
told
you
enough
do
go
out
unless
you
can
protect
yourself
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
run
nobody
would
gun
down
an
unarmed
man
do
be
a
fool
i
see
bill
did
johnny
blazer
have
a
gun
when
he
was
found
no
leave
me
now
it
growing
lighter
jeff
resumed
his
journey
up
the
road
and
the
kitten
stretched
all
four
paws
against
his
neck
shaking
his
head
uncertainly
he
did
not
turn
aside
when
he
came
to
johnny
blazer
cabin
bill
ellis
had
told
him
to
get
to
granny
and
arm
himself
before
daylight
he
better
do
it
the
sun
was
just
rising
when
jeff
came
to
granny
green
hill
and
he
heard
pal
happy
roar
of
welcome
he
quickened
his
steps
and
even
on
this
hill
of
peace
he
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
watched
by
furtive
eyes
johnny
blazer
had
been
shot
down
in
cold
blood
at
the
door
he
composed
himself
granny
and
dan
must
not
be
worried
when
he
entered
the
cabin
an
ecstatic
pal
flung
himself
forward
and
jeff
tickled
the
big
dog
ears
he
turned
to
meet
granny
who
always
rose
with
the
sun
hiya
granny
he
plucked
the
kitten
from
his
shoulder
i
brought
you
a
present
oh
the
love
granny
cuddled
the
kitten
against
her
cheek
knowing
experienced
hands
and
instantly
liking
granny
almost
as
much
as
she
loved
him
the
kitten
licked
her
cheek
with
a
pink
tongue
and
fell
to
purring
rubbing
sleepy
eyes
dan
came
from
his
bedroom
jeff
hi
dan
my
land
granny
eyes
sparkled
like
sunshine
on
dewdrops
i
make
some
breakfast
right
away
what
you
see
in
ackerton
dan
asked
eagerly
what
you
see
in
ackerton
jeff
hang
on
to
your
horses
jeff
laughed
i
tell
you
in
good
time
granny
i
sold
your
tapestries
did
you
now
could
get
what
they
worth
though
jeff
said
sadly
land
had
no
idea
they
were
worth
anything
i
got
two
hundred
dollars
jeff
granny
almost
dropped
the
kitten
i
did
granny
four
times
as
much
as
i
told
you
i
get
but
and
there
a
place
for
more
granny
stroked
the
kitten
and
there
was
a
look
of
near
sadness
in
her
eyes
after
a
moment
she
said
gently
it
seems
almost
sinful
that
much
for
aught
so
small
it
not
jeff
assured
her
the
man
who
bought
them
from
me
will
make
a
profit
too
he
can
do
that
and
welcome
he
is
land
who
would
have
thought
it
two
hundred
dollars
half
would
do
me
for
a
year
all
would
do
you
for
two
years
granny
shook
her
head
no
jeff
for
years
i
abided
here
and
never
had
a
hundred
dollars
all
at
once
never
missed
it
either
when
enos
was
sick
i
might
have
paid
a
doctor
for
him
if
you
see
fit
to
give
me
half
i
take
it
should
i
have
need
of
aught
that
is
not
at
my
hand
half
is
yours
jeff
hesitated
he
worked
for
profit
but
somehow
it
had
seemed
right
to
make
any
on
granny
still
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
a
hundred
dollars
was
a
vast
sum
and
obviously
she
had
gone
as
far
as
she
intended
to
go
granny
laughed
we
leave
it
that
way
and
i
have
more
ta
oh
hang
i
keep
forgettin
the
name
more
cloths
the
next
time
you
go
it
seems
a
mort
of
pay
for
what
pleasures
me
so
dear
now
i
rouse
up
some
eatables
she
baked
delicious
pancakes
fried
a
heaping
platter
of
sausage
and
put
them
on
the
table
granny
and
dan
listened
intently
prompting
him
if
he
omitted
the
smallest
detail
as
jeff
told
everything
about
his
trip
to
ackerton
when
he
had
finished
he
looked
pointedly
at
dan
declaring
and
finally
i
arranged
for
you
to
go
back
to
school
in
september
i
not
going
dan
said
firmly
you
must
go
jeff
urged
dan
you
and
i
can
build
up
a
good
business
here
but
unless
we
always
want
to
carry
peddlers
packs
one
of
us
has
to
know
business
methods
the
place
to
learn
them
is
in
school
i
want
to
carry
a
pack
you
have
your
chance
it
is
going
to
work
that
fast
think
of
ten
or
maybe
even
fifteen
years
from
now
imagine
a
trading
post
in
smithville
and
a
store
in
ackerton
with
blazer
and
tarrant
enterprises
in
gold
letters
a
foot
high
across
both
of
jeff
grinned
we
could
cut
out
the
ltd
if
we
were
partners
we
would
be
limited
any
more
dan
said
stubbornly
i
ca
go
could
you
if
if
you
were
satisfied
about
your
pop
dan
hesitated
you
promise
jeff
i
promise
before
i
go
before
you
go
then
dan
sighed
i
reckon
i
can
go
back
good
jeff
said
quickly
now
i
want
you
to
stay
here
and
keep
pal
with
you
i
going
away
for
a
little
while
where
you
going
jeff
into
smithville
and
i
taking
the
shotgun
i
going
with
you
not
this
time
i
have
to
go
alone
but
it
wisdom
he
speaks
granny
said
softly
you
bide
here
dan
well
when
you
coming
back
jeff
i
do
know
exactly
but
i
will
be
back
you
take
a
care
now
do
be
fretting
about
me
jeff
grinned
but
he
was
not
grinning
when
with
the
shotgun
in
his
right
hand
and
the
shells
in
his
pocket
he
left
granny
house
and
hit
the
trail
back
to
smithville
the
time
for
a
showdown
was
here
jeff
planned
as
he
walked
he
had
always
known
that
he
would
stop
wandering
and
settle
down
when
and
if
he
found
a
place
he
liked
well
enough
and
he
liked
these
hills
though
he
never
been
able
to
imagine
himself
confined
to
any
one
small
spot
the
hills
were
not
small
they
presented
a
challenge
he
liked
the
fact
that
he
have
to
fight
for
his
right
to
be
here
and
that
there
were
problems
to
be
solved
was
not
extraordinary
he
always
had
to
fight
and
there
always
been
problems
jeff
knew
suddenly
what
he
had
never
known
before
his
whole
life
had
been
almost
desperately
lonely
he
had
thought
of
it
in
such
a
light
because
there
had
been
no
fair
basis
for
comparison
never
having
been
anything
except
lonely
he
could
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
otherwise
now
he
had
dan
granny
pal
and
a
genuine
love
for
all
three
they
were
his
and
having
them
was
good
he
had
no
illusions
about
becoming
very
rich
for
he
saw
no
great
wealth
in
the
offing
there
would
be
a
comfortable
living
with
always
enough
variety
so
that
there
would
be
continual
zest
the
hill
people
needed
what
the
outside
world
could
offer
but
without
someone
to
act
as
intermediary
they
had
almost
no
chance
of
getting
it
those
of
the
outside
world
delighted
in
the
products
of
the
hills
and
they
had
the
money
to
pay
for
them
nobody
would
be
cheated
jeff
put
these
thoughts
behind
him
first
things
must
always
be
first
and
before
he
did
anything
else
he
had
to
meet
and
fight
whoever
was
gunning
for
him
for
dan
sake
and
his
own
conscience
he
must
bring
to
justice
whoever
had
shot
johnny
blazer
he
could
do
neither
with
words
for
it
had
come
to
guns
but
before
he
could
use
the
shotgun
effectively
he
had
to
have
live
ammunition
for
it
he
wished
mightily
that
he
had
left
at
least
one
shell
loaded
wanting
only
to
see
if
anything
had
been
disturbed
there
jeff
swung
aside
when
he
came
to
johnny
blazer
cabin
he
entered
inside
each
man
armed
with
a
rifle
that
swung
at
once
to
cover
jeff
were
pete
barr
yancey
grant
and
dabb
whitney
the
talking
tree
they
stood
along
the
wall
unkempt
and
untidy
but
there
was
something
about
them
that
was
as
cold
and
deadly
as
the
whine
of
a
bullet
or
the
fangs
of
a
viper
they
were
lean
as
weasels
and
as
fast
the
rifles
they
held
from
the
repeating
carbines
belonging
to
barr
yancey
dabb
and
grant
to
pete
fifty
caliber
seemed
a
part
of
them
and
they
had
grown
up
with
those
rifles
these
were
men
who
had
no
shots
to
waste
and
who
therefore
must
make
every
one
count
they
would
be
shamed
if
they
shot
a
turkey
or
grouse
anywhere
except
through
the
head
and
they
had
only
raucous
jeers
for
whoever
was
unable
to
shoot
as
well
turn
pete
ordered
gruffly
not
here
ya
fool
barr
countermanded
the
order
a
fair
half
of
smithville
come
pete
sneered
let
come
they
wo
find
us
no
obviously
barr
was
in
command
this
goes
my
way
jeff
stood
cold
and
shaken
and
knowing
that
when
he
walked
into
the
cabin
he
had
walked
into
his
own
death
these
must
be
the
men
about
whom
bill
ellis
had
warned
him
but
why
should
the
whitneys
want
to
kill
him
summoning
all
his
past
experience
with
tarrant
enterprises
which
had
taught
him
to
try
to
appear
outwardly
cool
in
the
hottest
of
spots
jeff
did
his
best
to
seem
not
only
calm
but
to
take
full
command
of
the
situation
you
in
my
cabin
he
said
quietly
we
knaow
pete
eyes
were
but
you
wo
be
needin
it
fer
long
the
rest
of
the
whitneys
said
nothing
jeff
studied
them
and
tried
by
reading
their
faces
to
determine
his
next
act
pete
so
poisoned
with
hatred
that
it
distorted
his
face
offered
nothing
yancey
dabb
and
grant
might
be
swayed
if
it
were
not
for
barr
dominating
the
rest
and
with
them
at
the
same
time
he
stood
apart
from
them
he
was
strong
pete
was
weak
and
for
that
very
reason
extremely
dangerous
the
rest
needed
leadership
but
while
there
was
no
lust
in
barr
eyes
neither
was
there
any
mercy
jeff
looked
steadily
at
him
and
kept
his
voice
quiet
what
it
about
we
liked
ya
peddler
barr
voice
was
very
grave
we
liked
ya
you
traded
fair
with
your
goods
but
there
no
bit
of
room
in
these
hills
for
a
policeman
policeman
jeff
exploded
we
know
barr
seemed
downcast
as
though
someone
he
trusted
had
betrayed
him
the
boy
told
us
told
you
what
all
an
serve
ya
naught
to
plead
or
ask
pardon
if
you
a
man
be
one
now
jeff
head
whirled
apparently
while
he
was
in
ackerton
one
or
more
of
the
whitneys
had
met
dan
and
the
boy
had
spun
some
fantastic
tale
jeff
looked
over
his
captors
again
and
saw
only
unyielding
determination
he
took
a
deep
breath
before
he
spoke
what
did
dan
tell
you
enough
barr
grunted
we
had
the
truth
from
a
babe
mouth
but
dabb
interrupted
what
made
ye
set
your
mind
on
the
thought
that
a
whitney
blazer
did
you
we
do
not
pry
into
killin
barr
said
you
erred
when
you
did
another
piece
fitted
into
the
puzzle
evidently
dan
had
told
whoever
it
was
he
had
met
that
he
and
jeff
were
out
to
avenge
johnny
and
doubtless
he
said
that
jeff
was
an
officer
jeff
pondered
dabb
question
and
barr
comment
it
was
possible
even
probable
that
only
his
killer
knew
who
had
shot
johnny
whoever
was
guilty
would
be
a
fool
if
he
was
anything
except
about
it
leave
us
shoot
him
pete
said
nasally
serve
naught
to
do
elsewise
i
said
we
wait
barr
growled
jeff
breathed
a
little
easier
the
whitneys
intended
to
shoot
him
but
not
immediately
and
he
wondered
what
they
were
waiting
for
and
why
perhaps
as
barr
had
mentioned
they
were
too
close
to
smithville
and
in
order
to
remain
unseen
perhaps
they
would
wait
until
night
to
take
him
out
maybe
there
were
other
reasons
but
evidently
he
had
a
little
time
jeff
took
a
shot
in
the
dark
i
be
missed
in
ackerton
we
know
barr
muttered
the
boy
said
it
all
jeff
moistened
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
his
chance
shot
had
ricocheted
whatever
story
dan
had
concocted
tied
in
with
jeff
trip
to
ackerton
he
had
to
think
his
way
out
of
this
people
will
be
looking
for
me
they
wo
find
you
barr
promised
but
could
be
they
find
us
jeff
said
pointedly
five
against
one
you
had
a
shotgun
when
you
come
in
and
if
i
known
who
was
waiting
i
have
come
shooting
but
you
can
all
cheer
up
maybe
those
who
look
for
me
wo
expect
to
need
guns
and
you
can
take
them
just
like
you
did
me
maybe
they
wo
even
have
guns
then
you
can
shoot
them
down
from
ambush
you
did
johnny
six
pairs
of
eyes
regarded
him
and
only
pete
remained
unchanged
the
rest
shifted
from
deliberate
purposefulness
to
cold
fury
and
face
turned
white
his
lips
tautened
and
he
bit
his
words
off
and
spat
them
at
jeff
ye
lie
i
do
not
lie
swiftly
barr
closed
the
distance
between
them
his
left
hand
snaked
forward
and
his
open
palm
struck
jeff
cheek
it
was
not
a
blow
that
a
man
might
offer
a
worthy
antagonist
but
an
insulting
slap
barr
eyes
were
glowing
coals
ye
lie
policeman
nary
a
man
in
the
hills
shot
blazer
thataway
jeff
snarled
back
i
do
lie
and
i
can
prove
it
his
face
still
white
barr
stepped
back
he
jerked
his
rifle
to
shooting
position
and
lowered
it
reluctantly
tense
as
stretched
buckskin
he
studied
jeff
and
snapped
say
those
words
johnny
blazer
not
only
had
no
gun
when
he
was
shot
but
whoever
shot
him
was
hiding
when
he
did
it
jeff
pronounced
each
word
very
slowly
and
very
clearly
as
though
he
were
rehearsing
a
careful
speech
how
d
know
he
lacked
aught
to
shoot
back
i
jeff
thought
of
bill
ellis
and
caught
himself
in
time
i
saw
someone
who
found
him
on
my
ackerton
trip
johnny
had
no
gun
when
they
picked
him
up
shut
up
barr
whirled
furiously
on
his
cousin
who
had
started
to
speak
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
anyone
else
blazer
guns
found
in
his
cabin
jeff
laughed
tauntingly
you
hillbillies
are
brave
men
now
all
you
have
to
do
is
admit
that
whoever
shot
johnny
was
hiding
in
the
brush
still
furious
barr
regarded
him
steadily
how
do
ya
know
that
all
i
had
to
do
was
look
what
ya
look
at
jeff
answered
contemptuously
i
would
expect
any
of
you
to
think
that
far
but
the
bullet
went
clear
through
johnny
there
are
enough
trees
and
shrubs
around
so
that
it
had
to
nick
one
of
them
it
easy
to
figure
the
angle
it
came
from
jeff
held
his
breath
he
himself
had
not
thought
of
this
until
now
but
it
had
to
be
right
johnny
blazer
was
a
woodsman
if
whoever
shot
him
had
been
in
the
open
johnny
would
have
seen
him
because
he
was
unarmed
he
probably
would
have
died
anyhow
but
he
would
have
died
in
the
brush
for
he
would
at
least
have
tried
to
escape
dabb
digested
jeff
statement
and
spoke
solemnly
right
barr
none
among
us
thought
to
look
barr
was
momentarily
bewildered
none
saw
the
need
but
need
there
might
be
go
look
dabb
i
gao
too
pete
offered
dabb
goin
rifle
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
dabb
left
the
cabin
jeff
waited
uneasily
dabb
education
might
be
a
bit
short
in
the
conjugation
of
verbs
and
the
more
complex
forms
of
mathematics
but
it
had
taught
him
all
about
ballistics
when
he
came
back
he
would
know
whether
or
not
johnny
had
been
shot
from
ambush
if
he
had
been
jeff
looked
at
barr
stormy
eyes
and
shuddered
twenty
minutes
later
dabb
returned
he
came
slowly
and
somewhat
shrunkenly
as
though
he
had
been
both
derided
and
belittled
he
stood
in
the
doorway
not
looking
at
the
rest
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
muffled
and
reluctant
hit
true
barr
hit
true
enough
whosoever
shot
blazer
was
crouchin
in
a
little
patch
of
evergreens
a
hunnert
an
fifty
steps
from
the
road
he
said
as
though
that
was
vastly
important
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
his
crouch
he
broke
some
twigs
the
better
to
see
something
came
into
the
cabin
with
him
an
unseen
but
heavy
and
mournful
something
that
seemed
within
itself
to
rob
everyone
of
the
power
of
speech
the
whitneys
looked
sidewise
at
each
other
and
barr
spoke
slowly
thus
ye
saw
thus
i
saw
whar
did
the
lead
strike
the
tree
dabb
answered
dully
hit
buried
in
the
tree
there
was
silence
which
barr
broke
with
a
cry
this
day
i
know
shame
they
were
weighted
as
though
by
heavy
burdens
and
jeff
understood
why
they
scourged
themselves
by
the
cowardly
action
of
one
of
their
number
something
they
could
never
get
back
had
been
taken
from
all
of
them
they
must
hang
their
heads
because
among
them
walked
a
man
who
was
not
a
man
jeff
rubbed
salt
into
their
wounds
you
can
all
be
proud
of
yourselves
it
was
as
though
they
did
not
hear
this
terrible
crime
this
heinous
sin
had
been
committed
but
they
did
not
want
to
believe
grant
said
hopefully
maybe
an
outlander
no
outlander
barr
muttered
was
a
hill
man
jeff
trembled
fired
with
another
idea
if
the
tree
could
talk
he
had
thought
it
might
tell
who
shot
johnny
blazer
tree
could
talk
are
you
afraid
to
find
out
who
did
it
he
challenged
barr
glowered
at
him
an
how
do
we
do
that
dig
the
bullet
out
of
the
tree
pay
nao
heed
to
him
pete
intoned
he
would
but
tangle
us
an
lead
us
from
him
hold
your
tongue
barr
ordered
gruffly
no
man
walks
safe
with
one
among
us
who
shoots
men
as
he
would
a
varmint
get
the
bullet
dabb
dabb
left
a
second
time
and
jeff
hoped
his
wildly
beating
heart
could
not
be
heard
to
these
mountain
men
killing
was
right
as
long
as
men
met
in
a
fair
fight
but
it
was
the
extreme
depths
of
degradation
to
kill
as
johnny
blazer
killer
had
and
that
killer
was
about
to
be
known
only
one
rifle
could
have
fired
the
fatal
shot
and
the
hill
men
would
recognize
that
bullet
and
know
who
had
fired
it
or
would
they
four
of
the
whitneys
present
carried
thirty
caliber
rifles
and
there
must
be
more
in
the
hills
jeff
hopes
alternately
rose
and
waned
then
dabb
came
back
and
held
up
the
leaden
slug
so
all
could
see
four
pairs
of
eyes
swung
accusingly
on
pete
mushrooming
where
it
had
struck
johnny
and
then
the
tree
the
slug
still
retained
its
shape
where
it
had
fitted
its
brass
shell
there
could
be
no
mistake
it
was
fifty
caliber
sweat
broke
out
on
pete
forehead
hit
hit
me
barr
spat
you
he
he
stole
pelts
my
traps
you
met
him
unfair
pete
half
screamed
he
had
a
rifle
an
shot
afore
i
did
barr
said
relentlessly
whar
was
his
rifle
i
i
brought
it
back
here
he
had
no
rifle
you
lay
like
a
whiskered
cat
afore
a
mouse
den
gave
him
no
fairness
do
not
add
a
lie
to
cowardice
jeff
said
eagerly
now
you
know
barr
now
all
of
you
know
and
dan
did
tell
part
of
the
truth
i
promised
him
that
we
find
out
who
shot
his
father
it
was
all
we
wanted
and
all
we
will
want
i
am
not
a
policeman
barr
looked
squarely
at
him
so
you
say
it
true
go
to
ackerton
and
find
out
what
i
did
there
and
think
a
little
neither
the
whitneys
nor
anyone
else
can
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
forever
keep
it
there
do
the
right
thing
now
an
what
is
that
take
pete
into
smithville
and
turn
him
over
to
bill
ellis
he
get
a
fair
trial
yancey
exploded
give
our
kin
into
the
law
keep
is
best
to
shoot
him
ourselves
stop
the
talkin
barr
was
still
looking
at
jeff
you
say
ye
are
a
peddler
an
naught
else
i
say
so
yet
you
saw
fit
to
beholden
yourself
to
the
boy
you
took
it
upon
yourself
to
tell
him
you

with
whosoever
shot
his
father
i
did
then
be
ye
peddler
or
policeman

here
through
the
day
barr
pronounced
with
the
night
we
shall
go
to
a
cabin
on
trilley
ridge
you
have
a
shotgun
an
barr
inclined
a
contemptuous
head
toward
pete
he
has
a
rifle
with
the
dawn
both
at
the
same
time
ye
walk
on
trilley
ridge
if
you

the
ridge
peddler
ye
be
free
to
come

yancey
shall
be
at
the
foot
of
trilley
ridge
to
shoot
should
one
of
ye
flee
rather
than
fight
grant
dabb
and
yancey
nodded
solemn
agreement
jeff
head
reeled
with
tomorrow
dawn
he
was
to
fight
a
death
duel
with
pete
whitney
barr
would
be
with
them
all
night
to
make
sure
that
things
went
according
to
his
fantastic
plan
dabb
grant
and
yancey
would
be
waiting
to
kill
whoever
violated
the
terms
of
the
duel
if
jeff
won
even
though
he
would
be
privileged
to
remain
in
the
hills
he
would
have
killed
a
man
regardless
of
what
happened
or
who
won
the
whitneys
would
have
rid
themselves
of
an
unwelcome
kinsman
and
closed
the
mouth
of
one
who
might
be
a
policeman
jeff
licked
dry
lips
he
had
never
killed
a
man
and
knew
that
he
could
never
kill
he
tried
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
something
he
could
do
and
there
was
nothing
jeff
licked
his
lips
again
what
say
you
barr
demanded
it
it
a
crazy
idea
is
what
ye
wanted
what
ye
told
the
boy
you
git
i
did
tell
him
i
get
it
this
way
for
heaven
sake
man
listen
to
reason
the
law
and
not
me
should
take
care
of
this
barr
eyes
flamed
are
ye
a
policeman
no
the
boy
said
different
mebbe
grant
said
slowly
be
best
to
shoot
him
i
go
on
trilley
ridge
with
with
who
used
to
be
my
kin
jeff
heaved
a
great
sigh
first
things
first
always
a
new
customer
down
the
road
and
if
he
went
on
the
ridge
he
would
have
time
to
think
if
he
did
not
his
hours
were
numbered
anyway
he
said
slowly
let
it
be
your
way
barr
barr
said
quietly
is
well
ye
say
so
for
not
be
right
should
a
whitney
shoot
a
whitney
or
be
shot
by
one
d
lack
aught
my
pack
barr
looked
curiously
at
him
but
jeff
made
no
attempt
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
always
been
able
to
pull
almost
anything
he
needed
out
of
his
pack
and
there
should
be
something
to
help
him
now
he
think
of
what
it
was
but
the
pack
had
been
a
part
of
him
for
so
long
that
he
would
feel
better
if
he
had
it
whar
the
pack
barr
asked
at
granny
wilson
get
it
an
fetch
it
barr
directed
yancey
d
need
aught
else
jeff
brain
was
still
whirling
no
barr
glanced
inquiringly
at
pete
who
stared
like
a
vicious
animal
and
said
nothing
there
was
finality
in
barr
words
ask
no
more
for
it
shall
not
be
given
both
have
had
your
say
the
words
hammered
dully
at
jeff
ears
then
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
swallowed
twice
for
the
first
time
he
became
aware
of
the
shotgun
shells
that
weighted
his
pocket
they
were
even
more
harmless
than
so
many
stones
for
they
were
still
loaded
with
paper
but
he
been
given
a
chance
to
speak
and
he
had
not
spoken
pal
went
wild
with
joy
when
jeff
returned
from
ackerton
he
stayed
as
close
as
he
could
get
for
he
had
missed
his
master
greatly
and
needed
him
sorely
he
smirked
at
the
white
kitten
when
he
spotted
it
but
made
no
hostile
move
because
jeff
had
brought
it
wholly
contented
pal
lay
at
jeff
feet
while
he
breakfasted
and
talked
with
granny
and
dan
when
jeff
rose
to
leave
pal
danced
happily
to
the
door
and
wagged
his
tail
in
anticipation
everything
was
once
more
as
it
had
been
and
should
be
they
were
about
to
go
peddling
together
on
the
trails
the
big
dog
glanced
back
to
see
if
dan
was
coming
too
instead
the
boy
grasped
his
collar
you
stay
here
pal
flattened
his
ears
and
drooped
his
tail
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
go
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
hopefully
in
front
of
the
door
then
he
went
sadly
back
into
the
kitchen
playing
with
a
ball
of
paper
that
granny
had
wadded
up
and
thrown
on
the
floor
the
fluffy
kitten
arched
its
back
and
spat
pal
paid
no
attention
his
heart
was
heavy
and
joy
had
gone
with
jeff
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
he
was
a
wooden
dog
who
did
not
even
rouse
himself
when
yancey
whitney
came
to
the
door
said
that
jeff
wanted
his
pack
and
went
away
with
it
that
afternoon
he
followed
dan
about
the
hill
but
he
had
no
eyes
for
the
sheep
the
cow
the
mule
and
he
lacked
zest
even
for
chasing
blackbirds
that
came
to
pillage
granny
garden
he
cared
only
about
the
trail
up
which
jeff
had
come
and
down
which
he
had
gone
again
that
night
after
dan
and
granny
had
gone
to
bed
pal
padded
restlessly
over
to
the
door
eagerly
he
sniffed
every
wind
that
blew
and
every
scent
that
tickled
his
nose
he
knew
when
six
deer
feeling
safe
in
the
cover
of
night
came
out
of
the
forest
and
climbed
the
hill
to
graze
in
the
sheep
pasture
he
heard
a
mouse
rustle
and
he
was
aware
when
a
owl
cruised
past
the
door
all
these
things
he
smelled
or
heard
he
felt
only
the
absence
of
his
master
the
night
was
very
deep
and
very
black
when
pal
yearning
for
jeff
became
unbearable
he
pushed
his
nose
against
the
door
and
when
he
did
so
the
latch
rattled
slightly
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
bent
his
head
toward
the
noise
but
he
did
not
understand
any
of
the
mysterious
ways
by
which
people
fastened
things
softly
he
reared
against
the
door
sniffing
at
every
crack
getting
down
he
trembled
anxiously
then
inch
by
inch
he
began
a
second
inspection
of
the
door
it
was
completely
accidental
when
in
raising
his
head
he
pushed
the
latch
upward
and
the
door
swung
open
pal
did
not
linger
to
think
about
anything
else
he
knew
only
that
the
way
was
clear
he
flew
into
the
night
found
jeff
trail
and
raced
along
it
at
johnny
blazer
cabin
he
scented
jeff
trail
and
that
of
five
whitneys
the
yancey
had
gone
back
there
leading
into
the
hills
pal
followed
along
he
halted
momentarily
at
the
foot
of
trilley
ridge
for
dabb
whitney
was
sitting
on
a
big
rock
and
the
smell
of
his
pipe
was
rank
and
heavy
in
the
darkness
pal
slipped
past
knowing
that
he
could
not
be
seen
in
the
night
he
caught
the
odor
of
wood
smoke
then
mingled
with
it
were
the
scents
of
pete
and
barr
whitney
and
of
jeff
abandoning
the
trail
pal
followed
his
nose
to
his
beloved
master
he
came
to
the
cabin
and
scratched
on
the
door
surprise
they
came
to
the
cabin
on
trilley
ridge
after
dark
jeff
and
pete
walking
side
by
side
and
barr
silent
behind
them
jeff
balanced
the
pack
on
his
shoulders
and
was
glad
he
had
it
there
it
was
an
old
friend
and
had
always
been
a
true
one
he
had
been
in
trouble
many
times
while
it
was
on
his
shoulders
but
he
had
never
stayed
in
trouble
as
they
walked
he
tried
to
pinpoint
directions
but
because
of
the
darkness
he
could
not
do
so
they
had
left
the
road
for
a
path
so
faint
that
the
casual
traveler
would
not
even
see
it
as
he
passed
there
was
another
path
and
still
another
and
all
of
it
was
country
that
the
hill
men
knew
well
but
that
jeff
did
not
know
at
all
when
they
finally
reached
the
cabin
he
was
sure
only
that
it
was
north
of
the
road
but
it
would
not
have
been
an
unpleasant
journey
if
pete
had
not
been
walking
with
him
found
out
pete
had
retreated
sullenly
into
himself
and
jeff
again
thought
of
an
animal
but
pete
was
no
ordinary
savage
thing
that
might
attack
because
it
was
hungry
or
seeking
a
fight
he
planned
and
hidden
behind
his
weak
blue
eyes
was
a
crafty
brain
jeff
knew
that
only
thought
revolved
around
ways
to
kill
him
and
it
was
a
cold
thing
to
know
the
men
came
to
the
cabin
and
barr
said
this
is
hit
jeff
spoke
over
his
shoulder
you
sure
the
place
is
haunted
no
barr
seemed
perplexed
as
though
there
was
something
about
the
mission
he
no
longer
understood
push
the
door
an
go
in
sure
jeff
said
agreeably
he
opened
the
door
and
felt
pete
go
tense
beside
him
jeff
gripped
his
shotgun
with
both
hands
preparing
to
bring
it
crashing
down
on
the
man
head
pete
would
kill
without
imperiling
himself
if
he
could
and
almost
his
only
chance
would
occur
when
they
entered
the
dark
cabin
but
barr
knew
this
too
stay
here
he
ordered
his
cousin
and
to
jeff
got
a
match
in
your
pocket
yep
go
in
by
yourself
an
light
hit
strike
hit
to
the
tallow
candle
that
be
settin
on
the
table
jeff
entered
felt
the
cabin
walls
enclose
him
and
had
a
strange
feeling
that
barr
whitney
was
a
complete
fool
it
would
be
simple
to
swing
suddenly
cock
the
shotgun
as
he
swung
and
always
supposing
he
had
some
live
ammunition
send
a
leaden
hail
back
through
the
door
then
he
understood
barr
was
no
fool
he
had
merely
gauged
jeff
and
he
knew
men
he
had
known
that
pete
would
turn
and
shoot
if
sent
in
first
but
jeff
would
not
besides
jeff
thought
wryly
though
pete
might
be
forced
to
stand
in
any
line
of
fire
that
might
sweep
out
the
door
barr
would
be
elsewhere
jeff
took
a
match
from
his
pocket
struck
it
and
looked
around
the
cabin
it
was
one
fairly
large
room
and
at
the
far
end
was
a
natural
stone
fireplace
there
was
a
table
three
chairs
two
double
bunks
built
one
on
top
of
the
other
cooking
utensils
hanging
from
wooden
pegs
driven
into
the
wall
and
small
windows
the
cabin
was
either
a
bachelor
home
or
else
it
was
used
only
on
occasion
by
some
person
or
persons
who
had
reason
to
spend
time
here
jeff
touched
his
dying
match
to
the
fat
tallow
candle
that
stood
on
the
table
and
flicked
the
burned
match
onto
the
floor
come
on
in
he
said
cheerfully
and
welcome
to
our
happy
home
pete
face
was
cold
and
that
was
almost
the
only
expression
he
strode
to
a
chair
pulled
it
away
from
the
table
and
sat
down
with
his
rifle
across
his
lap
jeff
stood
his
shotgun
in
a
corner
and
turned
to
face
barr
snug
little
den
he
said
pleasantly
barr
looked
puzzled
and
said
nothing
however
the
burning
determination
and
the
sternness
were
partly
gone
from
his
face
this
was
a
serious
business
but
jeff
was
not
accepting
it
seriously
never
flicking
his
eyes
from
his
captives
barr
pulled
a
chair
very
close
to
the
door
here
we
be
he
pronounced
an
here
we
stay
the
sun
lightens
the
topmost
twigs
on
the
big
pines
that
cute
jeff
declared
admiringly
that
really
cute
barr
glared
at
him
what
is
your
description
the
sun
lightens
the
topmost
twigs
on
the
big
pines
not
exactly
poetry
but
it
has
a
poetic
spirit
well
if
going
to
be
here
all
night
we
should
do
something
besides
glare
at
each
other
he
slid
out
of
the
pack
laid
it
on
the
table
and
stretched
then
he
stifled
a
yawn
he
had
no
sleep
last
night
and
evidently
he
get
none
tonight
but
more
than
once
he
had
to
stay
awake
as
long
and
he
could
do
it
again
if
you
be
weary
barr
indicated
the
bunks
you
might
sleep
thanks
jeff
declined
but
i
afraid
i
have
bad
dreams
besides
this
may
be
my
last
chance
to
talk
with
you
what
we
talk
about
barr
barr
broke
out
suddenly
i
ca
plumb
ya
ca
plumb
ya
jeff
said
smoothly
it
easy
i
not
a
complex
person
i
tell
you
my
life
story
if
you
want
to
hear
it
wo
cost
you
a
cent
i
swan
barr
ejaculated
i
could
like
ye
a
lot
i
did
if
you
did
think
i
was
a
policeman
sorry
i
ca
change
your
mind
on
that
subject
but
i
not
barr
eyes
searched
jeff
why
the
boy
say
it
jeff
shrugged
if
i
knew
why
boys
say
things
i
be
a
lot
smarter
than
i
am
but
ya
did
tell
the
boy
ya
find
out
who
blazer
yup
yet
now
ye
got
the
chanst
you
pass
it
by
this
is
a
chance
i
do
want
to
kill
anybody
i
never
promised
dan
anything
except
that
we
find
his
father
murderer
afterwards
i
was
going
to
turn
him
over
to
the
law
barr
wrinkled
his
brows
but
ye
be
no
policeman
i
not
jeff
said
flatly
barr
what
had
you
intended
to
do
with
me
it
was
barr
turn
to
shrug
shoot
ya
and
in
your
opinion
that
was
right
barr
said
fiercely
a
body
do
stop
to
think
should
he
tromp
on
its
haid
does
he
find
a
pizen
snake
on
his
jeff
lapsed
into
silence
his
life
story
he
had
offered
in
jest
but
he
understood
barr
his
ancestors
had
been
among
the
first
to
come
to
america
and
they
had
come
because
there
was
room
enough
for
them
in
europe
but
neither
had
there
been
room
enough
in
america
scattered
colonies
for
people
so
fierce
reckless
and
proud
they
had
either
left
the
settlements
of
their
own
accord
or
been
driven
out
they
had
wanted
above
all
to
live
by
their
own
personal
inclinations
and
not
by
rules
which
they
had
little
part
in
making
always
they
had
sought
the
wildest
and
most
inaccessible
places
because
only
there
could
they
live
as
they
must
barr
whitney
typified
this
wild
independence
which
could
possibly
endure
sooner
or
later
even
the
hill
clans
must
submit
to
the
forward
march
of
civilization
and
jeff
hoped
that
the
advancing
juggernaut
would
not
crush
them
completely
the
spirit
they
represented
always
had
been
and
always
would
be
necessary
to
free
people
probably
the
older
ones
would
go
down
fighting
certainly
they
would
never
learn
that
they
must
bend
themselves
to
others
perhaps
their
children
or
their
children
would
jeff
shrugged
that
was
to
come
this
was
now
and
neither
civilization
nor
anything
else
had
as
yet
tamed
barr
whitney
jeff
rubbed
a
hand
on
his
trousers
you
ail
barr
asked
my
hand
twitching
the
oil
of
shunk
an
the
grease
of
mixed
two
of
one
to
one
of
the
other
an
cooked
on
a
fire
when
the
moon
near
horn
points
to
water
will
drive
out
ary
itch
jeff
grinned
ca
wait
for
the
moon
near
horn
to
point
to
water
and
besides
i
do
want
a
cure
when
my
hand
twitches
i
lucky
pete
moved
so
swiftly
that
he
seemed
in
one
split
second
to
be
sitting
on
his
chair
and
then
magically
to
be
standing
with
his
rifle
at
half
raise
but
quick
as
he
was
barr
was
quicker
his
rifle
cracked
a
lock
of
hair
detached
itself
from
pete
head
to
float
softly
to
the
floor
and
before
the
sound
died
barr
had
levered
another
cartridge
into
the
chamber
he
spoke
as
casually
as
though
he
had
just
shot
at
a
squirrel
goin
through
your
haid
pete
si
down
pete
sat
barr
grinned
jeff
dared
let
himself
think
of
the
prospect
that
awaited
tomorrow
morning
side
by
side
and
at
exactly
the
same
time
jeff
and
pete
would
be
allowed
to
leave
the
cabin
jeff
pulled
his
stomach
in
as
though
he
could
already
feel
pete
slug
ripping
through
it
again
he
pondered
escaping
but
all
he
could
think
of
was
what
he
had
already
considered
if
he
ran
one
of
the
waiting
whitneys
would
shoot
him
down
when
he
came
off
the
ridge
there
was
little
chance
of
doing
anything
tonight
barr
was
along
to
see
that
he
did
he
could
protect
himself
with
paper
bullets
jeff
had
a
wild
notion
of
whirling
as
they
stepped
out
the
door
smashing
pete
over
the
head
with
the
muzzle
of
his
shotgun
and
trying
to
claim
him
as
prisoner
but
that
was
a
very
wild
plan
which
had
almost
no
chance
of
success
pete
was
far
too
quick
and
far
too
expert
a
rifleman
jeff
put
such
thoughts
behind
him
no
man
could
do
anything
well
if
he
tried
to
do
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
and
first
things
must
be
first
he
shivered
how
about
a
fire
barr
lay
a
blaze
ye
want
thar
wood
in
the
box
jeff
laid
a
fire
lighted
it
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
as
flames
crackled
he
looked
at
a
darkened
window
and
had
a
curious
thought
that
this
night
would
never
end
it
should
he
decided
have
passed
long
ago
but
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
half
past
nine
he
should
be
hungry
but
he
was
they
eaten
in
johnny
cabin
and
now
he
was
too
nervous
to
eat
after
a
very
long
interval
he
looked
again
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
ten
jeff
glanced
at
his
pack
and
created
mental
images
of
the
goods
it
contained
there
were
knives
fishing
tackle
a
half
dozen
new
mouth
organs
fiddle
strings
gay
ribbons
scissors
needles
he
had
bought
only
what
the
hill
people
wanted
and
among
all
of
it
he
could
not
think
of
a
single
article
that
would
help
him
now
jeff
set
his
jaw
maybe
if
there
was
something
to
do
time
would
not
drag
so
slowly
and
besides
he
could
think
better
when
he
was
busy
play
cards
he
invited
no
barr
shook
his
head
oh
come
on
barr
tipped
his
head
toward
pete
who
sat
motionless
with
his
rifle
across
his
lap
unmoving
he
missed
nothing
and
was
ready
at
a
split
second
notice
to
take
advantage
of
anything
that
offered
take
his
rifle
away
jeff
urged
you
can
still
watch
him
a
body
has
the
right
to
keep
his
rifle
he
sure
is
nursing
it
jeff
felt
reckless
how
about
sitting
in
pete
we
do
have
to
shoot
each
other
before
morning
pete
refused
to
answer
jeff
pulled
his
chair
to
the
table
and
tried
to
entertain
himself
with
solitaire
but
he
was
too
tense
and
strained
to
concentrate
and
when
he
found
himself
adding
the
four
of
hearts
to
the
seven
of
spades
he
shoved
the
cards
across
the
table
and
let
them
lay
there
restlessly
he
threw
another
chunk
of
wood
on
the
fire
and
turned
to
barr
with
no
noise
and
almost
without
effort
barr
rose
his
eyes
were
alert
and
his
face
was
intent
he
backed
so
that
while
continuing
to
command
the
cabin
and
the
two
in
it
he
could
control
the
door
too
there
was
a
rasping
scratch
on
the
door
and
barr
said
softly
see
what
thar
see
who
jeff
opened
the
door
and
pal
panted
in
his
ears
were
flat
and
his
tail
as
giving
barr
a
wide
berth
and
glancing
suspiciously
at
pete
he
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
and
stood
not
knowing
whether
or
not
he
was
to
be
punished
for
leaving
granny
he
looked
expectantly
at
his
master
jeff
laughed
and
twitched
his
fingers
come
here
you
old
flea
cage
grinning
happily
pal
came
at
once
and
jeff
brushed
his
shaggy
head
with
an
affectionate
hand
he
was
less
tense
and
strangely
his
anxiety
lessened
the
great
dog
wagged
an
ecstatic
tail
while
jeff
continued
to
pat
his
head
for
a
short
space
delighted
to
be
near
each
other
once
more
neither
had
paid
attention
to
anything
else
pal
licked
jeff
face
with
a
big
sloppy
tongue
and
wagged
everything
from
his
muzzle
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
he
turned
to
growl
at
barr
and
pete
and
barr
flicked
his
rifle
i
would
leave
him
try
it
i
wo
jeff
promised
he
slipped
two
fingers
beneath
pal
collar
led
him
over
to
the
table
and
sat
down
bending
over
pal
as
though
continuing
to
caress
him
he
hoped
barr
could
not
hear
his
pounding
heart
and
was
glad
his
eyes
were
hidden
after
a
moment
jeff
raised
his
head
he
looked
too
casually
at
the
candle
that
flickered
a
foot
from
his
hand
trying
to
appear
disinterested
he
gauged
pete
exact
distance
and
barr
position
he
moistened
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
and
reviewed
his
plan
even
though
he
risked
a
burned
hand
doing
it
he
was
positive
that
he
could
snuff
the
candle
out
before
barr
could
shoot
then
he
tip
the
table
over
and
fight
his
way
out
jeff
nibbled
his
lower
lip
and
looked
doubtfully
at
pal
barr
was
supple
as
an
eel
and
strong
as
an
ox
jeff
might
need
help
and
could
he
count
on
pal
barr
asked
suspiciously
what
ye
flustered
about
jeff
muttered
silently
at
himself
he
had
a
plan
if
it
was
desperate
the
situation
called
for
desperate
measures
but
everything
depended
on
surprise
to
give
barr
the
slightest
warning
would
also
give
him
time
to
shoot
jeff
it
went
without
saying
that
he
would
then
be
able
to
shoot
pal
and
jeff
had
the
least
doubt
that
barr
would
be
happy
to
do
both
he
forced
a
laugh
it
just
nice
to
see
something
around
here
that
not
to
shoot
something
else
barr
remained
alert
whar
ye
get
blazer
dog
found
him
over
beyond
cressman
jeff
said
truthfully
do
you
keep
dogs
houn
barr
admitted
would
pester
myself
with
a
dog
such
as
that
jeff
cast
for
a
way
to
lull
barr
depends
on
what
you
want
in
a
dog
would
you
say
could
what
do
you
want
jeff
did
his
best
to
look
like
a
man
who
faces
a
desperate
situation
but
who
was
mightily
cheered
because
his
dog
saw
fit
to
track
him
down
if
he
did
everything
exactly
right
and
with
precision
his
plan
had
at
least
an
even
chance
of
working
escape
would
not
solve
everything
pete
would
still
be
unpunished
and
if
the
whitneys
should
meet
him
jeff
again
they
would
not
bother
to
take
him
prisoner
they
shoot
on
sight
but
he
could
name
johnny
killer
that
would
start
things
and
maybe
he
be
able
to
finish
them
regardless
of
what
might
happen
in
the
future
this
was
now
jeff
had
to
get
out
of
the
cabin
before
he
could
do
anything
else
but
it
was
as
though
barr
could
read
his
mind
you
ponderin
he
accused
is
that
a
crime
in
these
hills
if
barr
said
deliberately
you
try
to
make
a
break
i
kill
ye
in
your
tracks
i
have
spoke
it
jeff
said
irritably
do
be
a
darn
fool
do
you
be
one
nuther
you
gettin
a
chanst
yes
jeff
sighed
a
big
chance
he
looked
again
at
the
candle
any
of
your
hounds
ever
get
you
out
of
jail
barr
how
might
a
houn
do
such
well
pal
got
me
out
those
words
i
mistrust
he
did
jeff
insisted
it
was
in
cressman
he
told
of
the
cressman
jail
and
of
how
he
was
literally
thrown
out
of
it
because
when
he
played
the
mouth
organ
pal
howled
he
spoke
of
inquiring
the
way
to
delview
as
a
ruse
to
throw
pop
and
joe
parker
from
his
trail
for
he
suspected
that
they
had
intended
to
have
him
rearrested
there
instead
of
going
to
delview
he
had
come
over
the
hills
to
smithville
barr
chuckled
derisively
peddlin
teach
you
sech
tall
tales
it
true
ha
you
toot
music
an
the
dog
howls
let
me
show
you
jeff
took
a
mouth
organ
from
his
pack
blew
a
soft
note
and
pal
responded
with
a
moaning
wail
that
trailed
out
on
a
soft
soprano
note
barr
seemed
dumfounded
doggone
jeff
eyes
strayed
to
the
candle
barr
rose
wrenched
it
from
its
drippings
and
put
it
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
he
resumed
his
seat
i
can
see
best
when
hit
thar
he
announced
grimly
you
havin
notions
that
candle
was
you
why
no
of
course
not
jeff
managed
to
appear
innocent
even
while
he
mentally
kicked
himself
his
chance
had
come
and
gone
there
be
another
chance
and
barr
seemed
more
at
ease
this
night
i
lear
what
i
knew
not
a
dog
howls
to
noise
this
one
does
make
him
do
hit
is
a
mighty
curious
thing
jeff
blew
another
note
and
pal
howled
again
barr
eyes
sparkled
an
elemental
creature
himself
he
was
interested
in
the
elemental
and
this
fascinated
him
he
must
find
the
answer
but
while
seeking
it
he
did
not
forget
to
keep
his
eyes
on
jeff
and
pete
why
he
do
hit
he
asked
i
do
know
jeff
admitted
ca
figure
it
myself
have
him
do
hit
some
more
at
the
first
note
pal
obliged
with
a
banshee
wail
that
subsided
then
gathered
force
and
mounted
again
the
sound
filled
the
cabin
and
offered
the
illusion
of
being
not
only
real
but
all
reality
it
was
as
though
the
door
burst
open
of
its
own
accord
and
jeff
rubbed
his
eyes
in
disbelief
ike
wilson
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
he
was
slim
supple
smiling
but
behind
the
smile
there
was
something
hard
as
stone
and
there
was
nothing
to
provoke
humor
in
the
cocked
shotgun
he
carried
half
erect
in
his
chair
barr
froze
there
pete
face
turned
white
ike
grinned
happily
hi
peddler
hi
ike
where
the
blazes
did
you
come
from
broadview
prison
stopped
by
granny
an
she
told
me
you
was
about
heerd
the
dog
howl
an
you
be
nigh
his
chuckle
was
rich
and
very
audible
i
did
expect
a
hul
nest
of
you
good
thing
i
peered
in
the
window
glass
afore
i
come
in
barr
snarled
this
ai

mix
oh
yes

is
yes
it
is
my
mix
now
just
hand

that
lil
old
rifle
gun
barr
stock
foremost
fighting
against
so
doing
but
unable
to
help
himself
barr
relinquished
his
rifle
ike
threw
it
through
the
open
door
now
pete
he
coaxed
i
need
pete
remained
rooted
smiling
but
with
a
deadly
something
behind
the
smile
ike
tightened
his
finger
on
the
shotgun
trigger
do
like
to
shoot
settin
but
i
will
pete
handed
his
rifle
over
ike
tossed
it
out
and
slammed
the
door
holding
the
shotgun
with
one
hand
he
drew
a
length
of
buckskin
from
his
pocket
and
whipped
it
straight
he
spoke
as
though
he
were
addressing
a
petulant
child
now
just
