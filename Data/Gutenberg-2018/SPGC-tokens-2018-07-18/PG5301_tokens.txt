chapter
i
it
would
have
been
idle
to
inquire
into
the
antecedents
or
even
the
circumstances
of
old
mother
beggarlegs
she
would
never
tell
the
children
at
all
events
were
convinced
of
that
and
it
was
only
the
children
perhaps
who
had
the
time
and
the
inclination
to
speculate
her
occupation
was
clear
she
presided
like
a
venerable
stooping
hawk
over
a
stall
in
the
covered
part
of
the
elgin
where
she
sold
gingerbread
horses
and
large
round
gingerbread
cookies
and
brown
sticky
squares
of
what
was
known
in
all
circles
in
elgin
as
taffy
she
came
it
was
understood
with
the
dawn
with
the
night
she
vanished
spending
the
interval
on
a
not
improbable
broomstick
her
gingerbread
was
better
than
anybody
s
but
there
was
no
comfort
in
standing
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
while
you
made
up
your
mind
the
horses
were
spirited
and
you
could
eat
them
a
leg
at
a
time
but
there
was
more
in
the
cookies
she
bent
such
a
look
on
you
so
fierce
and
intolerant
of
vacillation
she
belonged
to
the
group
of
odd
characters
rarer
now
than
they
used
to
be
etched
upon
the
vague
consciousness
of
small
towns
as
in
a
way
mysterious
and
uncanny
some
said
that
mother
beggarlegs
was
connected
with
the
aristocracy
and
some
that
she
had
been
let
off
being
hanged
the
alternative
was
allowed
full
swing
but
in
any
case
it
was
clear
that
such
persons
contributed
little
to
the
common
good
and
being
reticent
were
not
entertaining
so
you
bought
your
gingerbread
concealing
as
it
were
your
weapons
paying
your
copper
coins
with
a
neutral
nervous
eye
and
made
off
to
a
safe
distance
whence
you
turned
to
shout
insultingly
if
you
were
an
untrounced
young
male
of
elgin
old
mother
beggarlegs
old
mother
beggarlegs
and
why
beggarlegs
nobody
in
the
world
could
tell
you
it
might
have
been
a
dateless
waggery
or
it
might
have
been
a
corruption
of
some
more
dignified
surname
but
it
was
all
she
ever
got
serious
meticulous
persons
called
her
mrs
beggarlegs
slightly
lowering
their
voices
and
slurring
it
however
it
must
be
admitted
the
name
invested
her
with
a
graceless
anatomical
interest
it
penetrated
her
wizened
black
and
derisively
exposed
her
her
name
went
far
indeed
to
make
her
dramatic
lorne
murchison
when
he
was
quite
a
little
boy
was
affected
by
this
and
by
the
unfairness
of
the
way
it
singled
her
out
moved
partly
by
the
oppression
of
the
feeling
and
partly
by
a
desire
for
information
he
asked
her
sociably
one
day
in
the
act
of
purchase
why
the
gilt
was
generally
off
her
gingerbread
he
had
been
looking
long
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
gingerbread
with
the
gilt
on
it
being
accustomed
to
the
phrase
on
the
lips
of
his
father
in
connection
with
small
profits
mother
beggarlegs
so
unaccustomed
to
politeness
that
she
could
not
instantly
recognize
it
answered
him
with
an
imprecation
at
which
he
no
doubt
retreated
suddenly
thrown
on
the
defensive
hurling
the
usual
taunt
one
prefers
to
hope
he
didn
t
with
the
invincible
optimism
one
has
for
the
behaviour
of
lovable
people
but
whether
or
not
his
kind
attempt
at
colloquy
is
the
first
indication
i
can
find
of
that
active
sympathy
with
the
disabilities
of
his
which
stamped
him
later
so
intelligent
a
meliorist
even
in
his
boy
s
beginning
he
had
a
heart
for
the
work
and
mother
beggarlegs
but
for
a
hasty
conclusion
might
have
made
him
a
friend
it
is
hard
to
invest
mother
beggarlegs
with
importance
but
the
date
helps
me
the
date
i
mean
of
this
chapter
about
elgin
she
was
a
person
to
be
reckoned
with
on
the
of
may
i
will
say
at
once
for
the
reminder
to
persons
living
in
england
that
the
of
may
was
the
queen
s
birthday
nobody
in
elgin
can
possibly
have
forgotten
it
the
elgin
children
had
a
rhyme
about
it
the
of
may
is
the
queen
s
birthday
if
you
don
t
give
us
a
holiday
we
ll
all
run
away
but
elgin
was
in
canada
in
canada
the
of
may
was
the
queen
s
birthday
and
these
were
times
and
regions
far
removed
from
the
prescription
that
the
anniversary
should
be
observed
on
any
of
those
various
outlying
dates
which
by
now
must
have
produced
in
her
immediate
people
such
indecision
as
to
the
date
upon
which
her
majesty
really
did
come
into
the
world
that
day
and
that
only
was
the
observed
the
celebrated
a
day
with
an
essence
in
it
dawning
more
gloriously
than
other
days
and
ending
more
regretfully
unless
indeed
it
fell
on
a
sunday
when
it
was
kept
on
the
monday
with
a
slightly
clouded
feeling
that
it
wasn
t
exactly
the
same
thing
travelled
persons
who
had
spent
the
anniversary
there
were
apt
to
come
back
with
a
poor
opinion
of
its
celebration
in
the
old
country
a
pleasant
relish
to
the
appreciated
advantages
of
the
new
the
advantages
that
came
out
so
by
contrast
more
space
such
persons
indicated
more
enterprise
they
boasted
and
even
more
loyalty
they
would
flourish
all
with
an
affectionate
reminiscent
smile
at
the
little
ways
of
a
grandmother
a
bank
holiday
indeed
here
it
was
a
real
holiday
that
woke
you
with
bells
and
cannon
who
has
forgotten
the
time
the
ancient
piece
of
ordnance
in
the
square
blew
out
all
the
windows
in
the
methodist
church
and
went
on
with
squibs
and
crackers
till
you
didn
t
know
where
to
step
on
the
sidewalks
and
ended
up
splendidly
with
rockets
and
and
drunken
indians
vociferous
on
their
way
to
the
such
a
day
for
the
hotels
with
teams
hitched
three
abreast
in
front
of
their
aromatic
barrooms
such
a
day
for
the
circus
with
half
the
farmers
of
fox
county
agape
before
the
posters
with
all
their
chic
and
shock
they
can
not
produce
such
posters
nowadays
nor
are
there
any
vacant
lots
to
form
attractive
backgrounds
such
a
day
for
mother
beggarlegs
the
hotels
and
the
shops
and
stalls
for
eating
and
drinking
were
the
only
places
in
which
business
was
done
the
public
sentiment
put
universal
shutters
up
but
the
public
appetite
insisted
upon
excepting
the
means
to
carnival
an
air
of
ceremonial
festivity
those
fastened
shutters
gave
the
sunny
little
town
sat
round
them
important
and
significant
and
nobody
was
ever
known
to
forget
that
they
were
up
and
go
on
a
fool
s
errand
no
doubt
they
had
an
impressiveness
for
the
young
countryfolk
that
strolled
up
and
down
main
street
in
their
honest
best
turning
into
snow
s
for
when
a
youth
was
disposed
to
treat
gallantry
exacted
dishes
but
for
young
ladies
alone
or
family
parties
mrs
snow
would
bring
quantities
almost
without
asking
and
for
very
small
boys
one
dish
and
the
requisite
number
of
spoons
there
was
discrimination
there
was
choice
in
this
matter
of
treating
a
happy
excitement
accompanied
it
which
you
could
read
in
the
way
corydon
clapped
his
soft
felt
hat
on
his
head
as
he
pocketed
the
change
to
be
treated
to
dishes
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
by
the
same
young
man
gave
matter
for
private
reflection
and
for
public
entertainment
expressed
in
the
broad
grins
of
less
reckless
people
i
speak
of
a
soft
felt
hat
but
it
might
be
more
than
that
it
might
be
a
dark
green
one
with
a
feather
in
it
and
here
was
distinction
for
such
a
hat
indicated
that
its
owner
belonged
to
the
independent
order
of
foresters
who
would
leave
their
spring
wheat
for
forty
miles
round
to
meet
in
elgin
and
march
in
procession
wearing
their
hats
and
dazzlingly
scatter
upon
main
street
they
gave
the
day
its
touch
of
imagination
those
green
cocked
hats
they
were
lyrical
upon
the
highways
along
the
prosaic
sidewalks
by
twos
and
threes
they
sang
together
it
is
no
great
thing
a
hat
of
any
quality
but
a
small
thing
may
ring
dramatic
on
the
right
metal
and
in
the
vivid
idea
of
lorne
murchison
and
his
sister
advena
a
robin
hood
walked
in
every
independent
forester
especially
in
the
procession
which
shows
the
risks
you
run
if
you
a
person
of
honest
livelihood
and
solicited
vote
adopt
any
portion
of
a
habit
not
familiar
to
you
and
go
marching
about
with
a
banner
and
a
band
two
children
may
be
standing
at
the
first
street
corner
to
whom
your
respectability
and
your
property
may
at
once
become
illusion
and
your
outlawry
the
delightful
fact
a
cheap
trip
brought
the
order
of
green
hats
to
elgin
and
there
were
cheap
trips
on
this
great
day
to
persuade
other
persons
to
leave
it
the
grand
trunk
had
even
then
an
idea
of
encouraging
social
combination
for
change
of
scene
and
it
was
quite
a
common
thing
for
the
operatives
of
the
milburn
boiler
company
to
arrange
to
get
themselves
carried
to
the
lakeside
or
the
falls
at
half
a
dollar
a
head
the
hands
got
it
up
themselves
and
it
was
a
question
in
elgin
whether
one
might
sink
one
s
dignity
and
go
as
a
hand
for
the
sake
of
the
opportunity
a
question
usually
decided
in
the
negative
the
social
distinctions
of
elgin
may
not
be
easily
appreciated
by
people
accustomed
to
the
rough
and
ready
standards
of
a
world
at
the
other
end
of
the
grand
trunk
but
it
will
be
clear
at
a
glance
that
nobody
whose
occupation
prescribed
a
clean
face
could
be
expected
to
travel
cheek
by
jowl
as
a
privilege
with
persons
who
were
habitually
seen
with
smutty
ones
barefaced
smut
streaming
out
at
the
polite
afternoon
hour
of
six
jangling
an
empty
dinner
pail
so
much
we
may
decide
and
leave
it
reflecting
as
we
go
how
simple
and
satisfactory
after
all
are
the
prejudices
which
can
hold
up
such
obvious
justification
there
was
recently
to
be
pointed
out
in
england
the
heir
to
a
dukedom
who
loved
stoking
and
got
his
face
smutty
by
preference
he
would
have
been
deplorably
subversive
of
accepted
conventions
in
elgin
but
happily
or
otherwise
such
persons
and
such
places
have
at
present
little
more
than
an
imaginative
acquaintance
vaguely
cordial
on
the
one
side
vaguely
critical
on
the
other
and
of
no
importance
in
the
sum
polite
society
to
return
to
it
preferred
the
alternative
of
staying
at
home
and
mowing
the
lawn
or
drinking
raspberry
vinegar
on
its
own
beflagged
verandah
looking
forward
in
the
afternoon
to
the
lacrosse
match
there
was
nearly
always
a
lacrosse
match
on
the
queen
s
birthday
and
it
was
the
part
of
elegance
to
attend
and
encourage
the
home
team
as
well
as
that
of
small
boys
with
broken
straw
hats
who
sneaked
an
entrance
and
were
more
enthusiastic
than
anyone
it
was
a
quarter
to
get
in
so
the
spectators
were
naturally
composed
of
persons
who
could
afford
the
quarter
and
persons
like
the
young
flannigans
and
finnigans
who
absolutely
couldn
t
but
who
had
to
be
there
all
the
same
lorne
and
advena
murchison
never
had
the
quarter
so
they
witnessed
few
lacrosse
matches
though
they
seldom
failed
to
refresh
themselves
by
a
sight
of
the
players
after
the
game
when
crimson
and
perspiring
but
still
glorious
in
striped
jerseys
their
lacrosses
and
running
shoes
slung
over
one
shoulder
these
heroes
left
the
field
the
birthday
i
am
thinking
of
with
mrs
murchison
as
a
central
figure
in
the
kitchen
peeling
potatoes
for
dinner
there
was
a
lacrosse
match
of
some
importance
for
the
fox
county
championship
and
the
fox
county
cup
as
presented
by
the
member
for
the
south
riding
mrs
murchison
remains
the
central
figure
nevertheless
with
her
family
radiating
from
her
gathered
to
help
or
to
hinder
in
one
of
those
domestic
crises
which
arose
when
the
murchisons
were
temporarily
deprived
of
a
everybody
was
subject
to
them
in
elgin
everybody
had
to
acknowledge
and
face
them
let
a
new
mill
be
opened
and
it
didn
t
matter
what
you
paid
her
or
how
comfortable
you
made
her
off
she
would
go
and
you
might
think
yourself
lucky
if
she
gave
a
week
s
warning
hard
times
shut
down
the
mills
and
brought
her
back
again
but
periods
of
prosperity
were
very
apt
to
find
the
ladies
of
elgin
where
i
am
compelled
to
introduce
mrs
murchison
in
the
kitchen
you
d
better
get
up
the
girl
s
gone
lorne
had
stuck
his
head
into
his
sister
s
room
to
announce
while
yet
the
bells
were
ringing
and
the
rifles
of
the
local
volunteers
were
spitting
out
the
feu
de
joie
i
ve
lit
the
fire
an
swep
out
the
you
tell
mother
queen
s
birthday
too
i
guess
lobelia
s
about
as
mean
as
they
re
made
and
the
murchisons
had
descended
to
face
the
situation
lorne
had
by
then
done
his
part
and
gone
out
into
the
chromatic
possibilities
of
the
day
but
the
sense
of
injury
he
had
communicated
to
advena
in
her
bed
remained
and
expanded
lobelia
it
was
felt
had
scurvily
manipulated
the
situation
her
situation
it
might
have
been
put
if
any
murchison
had
been
in
the
temper
for
jesting
she
had
taken
unjustifiable
means
to
do
a
more
unjustifiable
thing
to
secure
for
herself
an
improper
and
unlawful
share
of
the
day
s
excitements
transferring
her
work
by
the
force
of
circumstances
to
the
shoulders
of
other
people
since
as
mrs
murchison
remarked
somebody
had
to
do
it
nor
had
she
her
mistress
testified
the
excuse
of
fearing
unreasonable
confinement
i
told
her
she
might
go
when
she
had
done
her
dishes
after
dinner
said
mrs
murchison
and
then
she
had
only
to
come
back
at
six
and
get
tea
what
s
getting
tea
i
advised
her
to
finish
her
ironing
yesterday
so
as
to
be
free
of
it
today
and
she
said
she
would
be
very
glad
to
now
i
wonder
if
she
did
finish
it
and
mrs
murchison
put
down
her
pan
of
potatoes
with
a
thump
to
look
in
the
family
clothes
basket
not
she
five
shirts
and
all
the
coloured
things
i
call
it
downright
deceit
i
believe
i
know
the
reason
she
ll
say
said
advena
she
objects
to
rag
carpet
in
her
bedroom
she
told
me
rag
carpet
upon
my
word
mrs
murchison
dropped
her
knife
to
exclaim
it
s
what
her
betters
have
to
do
with
i
ve
known
the
day
when
that
very
piece
of
rag
carpet
sixty
balls
there
were
in
it
and
every
one
i
sewed
with
my
own
fingers
was
the
best
i
had
for
my
spare
room
with
a
bit
of
ingrain
in
the
middle
dear
me
she
went
on
with
a
smile
that
lightened
the
whole
situation
how
proud
i
was
of
that
performance
she
didn
t
tell
me
she
objected
to
rag
carpet
no
mother
advena
agreed
she
knew
they
were
all
there
in
the
kitchen
supporting
their
mother
and
it
seems
an
opportunity
to
name
them
advena
the
eldest
stood
by
the
long
kitchen
table
washing
the
breakfast
cups
in
soft
soap
and
hot
water
the
soft
soap
mrs
murchison
had
a
barrelful
boiled
every
spring
in
the
back
yard
an
old
colonial
economy
she
hated
to
resign
made
a
fascinating
brown
lather
with
iridescent
bubbles
advena
poured
cupfuls
of
it
from
on
high
to
see
the
foam
rise
till
her
mother
told
her
for
mercy
s
sake
to
get
on
with
those
dishes
she
stood
before
a
long
low
window
looking
out
into
the
garden
and
the
light
filtering
through
apple
branches
on
her
face
showed
her
strongly
featured
and
intelligent
for
fourteen
advena
was
named
after
one
grandmother
when
the
next
girl
came
mrs
murchison
to
make
an
end
of
the
matter
named
it
abigail
after
the
other
she
thought
both
names
outlandish
and
acted
under
protest
but
hoped
that
now
everybody
would
be
satisfied
lorne
came
after
advena
at
the
period
of
a
naive
fashion
of
christening
the
young
sons
of
canada
in
the
name
of
her
it
was
a
simple
way
of
attesting
a
loyal
spirit
but
with
mrs
murchison
more
particular
motives
operated
the
marquis
of
lorne
was
not
only
the
deputy
of
the
throne
he
was
the
of
a
good
woman
of
whom
mrs
murchison
thought
more
and
often
said
it
for
being
the
woman
she
was
than
for
being
twenty
times
a
queen
and
he
had
made
a
metrical
translation
of
the
psalms
several
of
which
were
included
in
the
revised
psalter
for
the
use
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
canada
from
which
the
whole
of
knox
church
sang
to
the
praise
of
god
every
sunday
these
were
circumstances
that
weighed
with
mrs
murchison
and
she
called
her
son
after
the
royal
representative
feeling
that
she
was
doing
well
for
him
in
a
sense
beyond
the
mere
bestowal
of
a
distinguished
and
a
euphonious
name
though
that
as
she
would
have
willingly
acknowledged
was
well
enough
in
its
we
must
take
this
matter
of
names
seriously
the
murchisons
always
did
indeed
from
the
arrival
of
a
new
baby
until
the
important
sunday
of
the
christening
nothing
was
discussed
with
such
eager
zest
and
such
sustained
interest
as
the
name
he
should
get
there
was
a
fascinating
list
at
the
back
of
the
dictionary
and
to
the
last
minute
it
was
problematical
in
stella
s
case
mrs
murchison
actually
changed
her
mind
on
the
way
to
church
and
abby
who
had
sat
through
the
sermon
expecting
dorothy
maud
which
she
thought
lovely
publicly
cried
with
disappointment
stella
was
the
youngest
and
mrs
murchison
was
thankful
to
have
a
girl
at
last
whom
she
could
name
without
regard
to
her
own
relations
or
anybody
else
s
i
have
skipped
about
a
good
deal
but
i
have
only
left
out
two
the
boys
who
came
between
abby
and
stella
in
their
names
the
contemporary
observer
need
not
be
too
acute
to
discover
both
an
avowal
and
to
some
extent
an
enforcement
of
mr
murchison
s
political
views
neither
an
alexander
mackenzie
nor
an
oliver
mowat
could
very
well
grow
up
into
anything
but
a
sound
liberal
in
that
part
of
the
world
without
feeling
himself
an
unendurable
paradox
to
christen
a
baby
like
that
was
in
a
manner
a
challenge
to
public
attention
the
faint
relaxation
about
the
lips
of
dr
drummond
the
best
of
the
liberals
himself
though
he
made
a
great
show
of
keeping
it
out
of
the
pulpit
recognized
this
and
the
just
perceptible
stir
of
the
congregation
proved
it
sonorously
he
said
it
oliver
mowat
i
baptize
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
compliment
should
have
all
the
impressiveness
the
rite
could
give
it
while
the
murchison
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
family
pew
stood
on
one
foot
with
excitement
as
to
how
oliver
mowat
would
take
the
drops
that
defined
him
the
verdict
was
on
the
way
home
that
he
behaved
splendidly
alexander
mackenzie
the
year
before
had
roared
he
was
weeping
now
at
the
age
of
seven
silently
but
very
copiously
behind
the
woodpile
his
father
had
finally
cuffed
him
for
importunity
and
the
world
was
no
place
for
a
just
boy
who
asked
nothing
but
his
rights
only
the
woodpile
friendly
mossy
logs
unsplit
stood
inconscient
and
irresponsible
for
any
share
in
his
black
circumstances
and
his
tears
fell
among
the
lichens
of
the
stump
he
was
bowed
on
till
observing
them
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
could
cry
enough
to
make
a
pond
there
and
was
presently
disappointed
to
find
the
source
exhausted
the
murchisons
were
all
imaginative
the
others
oliver
and
abby
and
stella
still
poor
alec
s
rights
to
a
present
of
on
the
queen
s
birthday
were
common
ones
and
almost
statutory
how
their
father
sitting
comfortably
with
his
pipe
in
the
flickering
may
shadows
under
the
golden
pippin
reading
the
toronto
paper
could
evade
his
liability
in
the
matter
was
unfathomable
to
the
murchisons
it
was
certainly
illiberal
they
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
illegal
a
little
teasing
was
generally
necessary
but
the
resistance
today
had
begun
to
look
ominous
and
alec
as
we
know
too
temerarious
had
retired
in
disorder
to
the
woodpile
oliver
was
wiping
advena
s
dishes
he
exercised
himself
ostentatiously
upon
a
plate
standing
in
the
door
to
be
within
earshot
of
his
father
eph
wheeler
he
informed
his
family
eph
wheeler
he
s
got
cents
an
a
english
sixpence
an
a
yankee
nickel
an
mr
wheeler
s
only
a
common
working
man
a
lot
poorer
n
we
mr
murchison
removed
his
pipe
from
his
lips
in
order
apparently
to
follow
unimpeded
the
trend
of
the
dominion
s
leading
article
oliver
eyed
him
anxiously
do
father
he
continued
in
logical
sequence
aw
make
him
mother
said
abby
indignantly
it
s
the
queen
s
birthday
time
enough
when
the
butter
bill
s
paid
said
mrs
murchison
oh
the
butter
bill
say
father
aren
t
you
going
to
what
asked
john
murchison
and
again
took
out
his
pipe
as
if
this
were
the
first
he
had
heard
of
the
matter
give
us
our
fifteen
cents
each
to
celebrate
with
you
can
t
do
it
under
that
oliver
added
firmly
crackers
are
eight
cents
a
packet
this
year
the
small
nonsense
said
mr
murchison
the
reply
was
definite
and
final
and
its
ambiguity
was
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
their
father
disliked
giving
a
plump
refusal
nonsense
was
easier
to
say
if
not
to
hear
than
oliver
considered
for
a
moment
drew
abby
to
colloquy
by
the
pump
and
sought
his
brother
behind
the
woodpile
then
he
returned
to
the
charge
look
here
father
he
said
cash
down
we
ll
take
john
murchison
was
a
man
of
few
words
but
they
were
usually
impregnated
with
meaning
especially
in
anger
no
more
of
this
he
said
celebrate
fiddlesticks
go
and
make
yourselves
of
some
use
you
ll
get
nothing
from
me
for
i
haven
t
got
so
saying
he
went
through
the
kitchen
with
a
step
that
forbade
him
to
be
followed
his
eldest
son
arriving
over
the
backyard
fence
in
a
state
of
heat
was
just
in
time
to
hear
him
lorne
s
apprehension
of
the
situation
was
instant
and
his
face
fell
but
the
depression
plainly
covered
such
splendid
spirits
that
his
brother
asked
resentfully
well
what
s
the
matter
with
you
matter
oh
not
much
i
m
going
to
see
the
cayugas
beat
the
wanderers
that
s
all
an
abe
mackinnon
s
mother
said
he
could
ask
me
to
come
back
to
tea
with
them
can
i
mother
there
s
no
objection
that
i
know
of
said
mrs
murchison
shaking
her
apron
free
of
stray
but
you
won
t
get
money
for
the
lacrosse
match
or
anything
else
from
your
father
today
can
assure
you
they
didn
t
do
five
dollars
worth
of
business
at
the
store
all
day
yesterday
and
he
s
as
cross
as
two
oh
that
s
all
lorne
jingled
his
pocket
and
oliver
took
a
fascinated
step
toward
him
i
made
thirty
cents
this
morning
delivering
papers
for
fisher
his
boy
s
sick
i
did
the
north
ward
took
me
over
n
hour
guess
i
can
go
all
right
can
t
i
why
yes
i
suppose
you
can
said
his
mother
the
others
were
dumb
oliver
hunched
his
shoulders
and
kicked
at
the
nearest
thing
that
had
paint
on
it
abby
clung
to
the
pump
handle
and
sobbed
aloud
lorne
looked
gloomily
about
him
and
went
out
making
once
more
for
the
back
fence
he
encountered
alexander
in
the
recognized
family
retreat
oh
my
goodness
he
said
and
stopped
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
was
back
in
the
kitchen
followed
sheepishly
by
alexander
whose
grimy
face
expressed
the
hope
that
beat
behind
his
little
waistcoat
say
you
kids
he
announced
alec
s
got
four
cents
an
he
says
he
ll
join
up
this
family
s
going
to
celebrate
all
right
come
on
down
no
one
could
say
that
the
murchisons
were
demonstrative
they
said
nothing
but
they
got
their
hats
mrs
murchison
looked
up
from
her
occupation
alec
she
said
out
of
this
house
you
don
t
go
till
you
ve
washed
your
face
lorne
come
here
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
producing
a
bunch
of
keys
if
you
look
in
the
corner
of
the
top
small
drawer
in
my
bureau
you
ll
find
about
twenty
cents
say
nothing
about
it
and
mind
you
don
t
meddle
with
anything
else
i
guess
the
queen
isn
t
going
to
owe
it
all
to
chapter
ii
we
ve
seen
changes
mr
murchison
aye
we
ve
seen
dr
drummond
and
mr
murchison
stood
together
in
the
store
door
over
which
the
sign
john
murchison
hardware
had
explained
thirty
years
of
varying
commercial
fortune
they
had
pretty
well
begun
life
together
in
elgin
john
murchison
was
one
of
those
who
had
listened
to
mr
drummond
s
trial
sermon
and
had
given
his
vote
to
call
him
to
the
charge
since
then
there
had
been
few
sundays
when
morning
and
evening
mr
murchison
had
not
been
in
his
place
at
the
top
of
his
pew
where
his
dignified
and
intelligent
head
appeared
with
the
isolated
significance
of
a
strong
individuality
people
looked
twice
at
john
murchison
in
a
crowd
so
did
his
own
children
at
home
hearing
some
discussion
of
the
selection
of
a
premier
alec
looking
earnestly
at
him
once
said
why
don
t
they
tell
father
to
be
it
the
young
minister
looked
twice
at
him
that
morning
of
the
trial
sermon
and
asked
afterward
who
he
was
a
scotchman
mr
drummond
was
told
not
very
long
from
the
old
country
who
had
bought
the
playfair
business
on
main
street
and
settled
in
the
plummer
place
which
already
had
a
quarter
of
a
century
s
standing
in
the
annals
of
the
town
the
playfair
business
was
a
respectable
business
to
buy
the
plummer
place
though
it
stood
in
an
unfashionable
outskirt
was
a
respectable
place
to
settle
in
and
the
minister
in
casting
his
lot
in
elgin
envisaged
john
murchison
as
part
of
it
thought
of
him
confidently
as
a
dependance
saw
him
among
the
future
elders
and
of
the
congregation
a
man
who
would
be
punctual
with
his
sage
in
his
judgements
and
whose
views
upon
church
attendance
would
be
extended
to
his
family
so
the
two
came
contemporaries
to
add
their
labour
and
their
lives
to
the
building
of
this
little
outpost
of
empire
it
was
the
frankest
transfer
without
thought
of
return
they
were
there
to
spend
and
be
spent
within
the
circumference
of
the
spot
they
had
chosen
with
no
ambition
beyond
in
the
course
of
nature
even
their
bones
and
their
memories
would
enter
into
the
fabric
the
new
country
filled
their
eyes
the
new
town
was
their
opportunity
its
destiny
their
fate
they
were
altogether
occupied
with
its
affairs
and
the
affairs
of
the
growing
dominion
yet
obscure
in
the
heart
of
each
of
them
ran
the
undercurrent
of
the
old
allegiance
they
had
gone
the
length
of
their
tether
but
the
tether
was
always
there
thus
before
a
congregation
that
always
stood
in
the
early
days
had
the
minister
every
sunday
morning
for
thirty
years
besought
the
almighty
with
ardour
and
humility
on
behalf
of
the
royal
family
it
came
in
the
long
prayer
about
the
middle
not
in
the
perfunctory
words
of
a
ritual
but
in
the
language
of
his
choice
which
varied
according
to
what
he
believed
to
be
the
spiritual
needs
of
the
reigning
house
and
was
at
one
period
touching
certain
of
its
members
though
respectful
extremely
candid
the
general
assembly
of
the
church
of
scotland
now
in
session
also
was
it
ever
forgotten
once
and
even
the
prime
minister
and
those
who
sit
in
council
with
him
with
just
a
hint
of
extra
commendation
if
it
happened
to
be
mr
gladstone
the
minister
of
knox
church
elgin
ontario
canada
kept
his
eye
on
them
all
remote
as
he
was
and
concerned
with
affairs
of
which
they
could
know
little
his
sphere
of
duty
could
never
revolve
too
far
westward
to
embrace
them
nor
could
his
influence
under
any
circumstances
cease
to
be
at
their
disposal
it
was
noted
by
some
that
after
mr
drummond
had
got
his
from
an
american
university
he
also
prayed
occasionally
for
the
president
of
the
neighbouring
republic
but
this
was
rebutted
by
others
who
pointed
out
that
it
happened
only
on
the
occurrence
of
assassinations
and
held
it
reasonable
enough
the
cavillers
mostly
belonged
to
the
congregation
of
st
andrew
s
established
a
glum
lot
indeed
who
now
and
then
dropped
in
of
a
sunday
evening
to
hear
mr
drummond
preach
there
wasn
t
much
to
be
said
for
the
preaching
at
st
andrew
s
the
established
folk
went
on
calling
the
minister
of
knox
church
mr
drummond
long
after
he
was
doctor
to
his
own
congregation
on
account
of
what
they
chose
to
consider
the
dubious
source
of
the
dignity
but
the
knox
church
people
had
their
own
theory
to
explain
this
hypercriticism
and
would
promptly
turn
the
conversation
to
the
merits
of
the
sermon
years
it
was
in
point
this
monday
morning
when
the
doctor
not
being
established
we
need
not
hesitate
besides
by
this
time
nobody
did
stood
with
mr
murchison
in
the
store
door
and
talked
about
having
seen
changes
he
had
preached
his
anniversary
sermon
the
night
before
to
a
full
church
when
laying
his
hand
upon
his
people
s
heart
he
had
himself
to
repress
tears
he
was
aware
of
another
strand
completed
in
their
mutual
bond
the
sermon
had
been
a
moral
an
emotional
and
an
oratorical
success
and
in
the
expansion
of
the
following
morning
dr
drummond
had
remembered
that
he
had
promised
his
housekeeper
a
new
gas
and
that
it
was
high
time
he
should
drop
into
murchison
s
to
inquire
about
it
mrs
forsyth
had
mentioned
at
breakfast
that
they
had
ranges
with
exactly
the
improvement
she
wanted
at
thompson
s
but
the
minister
was
deaf
to
the
hint
thompson
was
a
congregationalist
and
improvement
or
no
improvement
it
wasn
t
likely
that
dr
drummond
was
going
outside
the
congregation
for
anything
he
required
it
would
have
been
on
a
par
with
a
wandering
tendency
in
his
flock
upon
which
he
systematically
frowned
he
was
as
great
an
autocrat
in
this
as
the
rector
of
any
country
parish
in
england
undermined
by
dissent
but
his
sense
of
obligation
worked
unfailingly
both
ways
john
murchison
had
not
said
much
about
the
sermon
it
wasn
t
his
way
and
dr
drummond
knew
it
you
gave
us
a
good
sermon
last
night
doctor
not
much
more
than
that
and
i
noticed
the
milburns
there
we
don
t
often
get
episcopalians
and
again
the
wilcoxes
thomas
wilcox
wholesale
grocer
was
the
chief
prop
of
st
andrew
s
were
sitting
just
in
front
of
us
we
overtook
them
going
home
and
wilcox
explained
how
much
they
liked
the
music
glad
to
see
you
i
said
glad
to
see
you
for
any
reason
mr
murchison
s
eye
twinkled
but
they
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
it
was
not
an
effusive
form
of
felicitation
the
minister
would
have
liked
it
less
if
it
had
been
felt
less
justified
perhaps
in
remembering
about
the
range
on
that
particular
morning
as
it
was
he
was
able
to
take
it
with
perfect
dignity
and
good
humour
and
to
enjoy
the
point
against
the
wilcoxes
with
that
laugh
of
his
that
did
everybody
good
to
hear
so
hearty
it
was
so
rich
in
the
grain
of
the
voice
so
full
of
the
zest
and
flavour
of
the
joke
the
range
had
been
selected
and
their
talk
of
changes
had
begun
with
it
mr
murchison
pointing
out
the
new
idea
in
the
boiler
and
dr
drummond
remembering
his
first
kitchen
stove
that
burned
wood
and
stood
on
its
four
legs
with
nothing
behind
but
the
stove
pipe
and
if
you
wanted
a
boiler
you
took
off
the
front
lids
and
put
it
on
and
how
remarkable
even
that
had
seemed
to
his
eyes
fresh
from
the
conservative
kitchen
notions
of
the
old
country
he
had
come
unhappily
a
widower
to
the
domestic
improvements
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
often
i
used
to
think
he
said
to
mr
murchison
if
my
poor
wife
could
have
seen
that
stove
how
delighted
she
would
have
been
but
i
doubt
this
would
have
been
too
much
for
her
altogether
that
stove
answered
mr
murchison
well
i
remember
it
i
sold
it
myself
to
your
predecessor
mr
wishart
for
thirty
dollars
the
last
purchase
he
ever
made
poor
man
it
was
great
business
for
me
i
had
only
two
others
in
the
store
like
it
one
of
them
old
milburn
bought
the
father
of
this
man
d
ye
mind
him
the
other
stayed
by
me
a
matter
of
seven
years
i
carried
a
light
stock
in
those
it
was
no
longer
a
light
stock
the
two
men
involuntarily
glanced
round
them
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
contrast
murchison
evoked
though
neither
of
them
from
motives
of
vague
delicacy
felt
inclined
to
dwell
upon
it
john
murchison
had
the
shyness
of
an
artist
in
his
commercial
success
and
the
minister
possibly
felt
that
his
relation
toward
the
prosperity
of
a
member
had
in
some
degree
the
embarrassment
of
a
s
the
stock
was
indeed
heavy
now
you
had
to
go
upstairs
to
see
the
ranges
where
they
stood
in
rows
and
every
one
of
them
bore
somewhere
upon
it
in
raised
black
letters
john
murchison
s
name
through
the
windows
came
the
iterating
ring
on
the
iron
from
the
foundry
in
chestnut
street
which
fed
the
shop
with
an
overflow
that
found
its
way
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
finicking
visitors
to
elgin
found
this
wearing
but
to
john
murchison
it
was
the
music
that
honours
the
conqueror
of
circumstances
the
ground
floor
was
given
up
to
the
small
wares
of
the
business
chiefly
imported
two
or
three
young
men
steady
and
moved
about
in
their
shirt
sleeves
among
shelves
and
one
of
them
was
our
friend
alec
our
other
friend
oliver
looked
after
the
books
at
the
foundry
their
father
did
everything
deliberately
but
presently
in
his
own
good
time
his
commercial
letter
paper
would
be
headed
with
regard
to
these
two
john
murchison
and
it
had
long
announced
that
the
business
was
wholesale
and
dr
drummond
and
mr
murchison
considering
the
changes
in
elgin
from
the
store
door
did
it
at
their
leisure
the
merchant
with
his
thumbs
thrust
comfortably
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
the
minister
with
that
familiar
trick
of
his
balancing
on
one
foot
and
suddenly
throwing
his
slight
weight
forward
on
the
other
a
bundle
of
nerves
people
called
the
doctor
to
stand
still
would
have
been
a
penance
to
him
even
as
he
swayed
backward
and
forward
in
talking
his
hand
must
be
busy
at
the
seals
on
his
watch
chain
and
his
shrewd
glance
travelling
over
a
dozen
things
you
would
never
dream
so
clever
a
man
would
take
notice
of
it
was
a
prospect
of
moderate
commercial
activity
they
looked
out
upon
a
street
of
mellow
shopfronts
on
both
sides
of
varying
height
and
importance
wearing
that
air
of
marking
a
period
a
definite
stop
in
growth
that
so
often
coexists
with
quite
a
reasonable
degree
of
activity
and
independence
in
colonial
towns
one
could
almost
say
standing
there
in
the
door
at
murchison
s
where
the
line
of
legitimate
enterprise
had
been
overpassed
and
where
its
intention
had
been
none
too
sanguine
on
the
one
hand
in
the
faded
and
pretentious
red
brick
building
with
the
false
third
storey
occupied
by
cleary
which
must
have
been
let
at
a
loss
to
or
anything
else
on
the
other
hand
in
the
solid
gregory
block
opposite
the
market
where
rents
were
as
certain
as
the
dividends
of
the
bank
of
british
north
america
main
street
expressed
the
idea
that
for
the
purpose
of
growing
and
doing
business
it
had
always
found
the
days
long
enough
drays
passed
through
it
to
the
grand
trunk
station
but
they
passed
one
at
a
time
a
certain
number
of
people
went
up
and
down
about
their
affairs
but
they
were
never
in
a
hurry
a
street
car
jogged
by
every
ten
minutes
or
so
but
nobody
ran
after
it
there
was
a
decent
procedure
and
it
was
felt
that
bofield
he
was
too
in
putting
in
an
elevator
was
just
a
little
unnecessarily
in
advance
of
the
times
bofield
had
only
two
storeys
like
everybody
else
and
a
very
easy
staircase
up
which
people
often
declared
they
preferred
to
walk
rather
than
wait
in
the
elevator
for
a
young
man
to
finish
serving
and
work
it
these
of
course
were
the
sophisticated
people
of
elgin
countryfolk
on
a
market
day
would
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
the
young
man
and
think
nothing
of
it
and
i
imagine
bofield
found
his
account
in
the
elevator
though
he
did
complain
sometimes
that
such
persons
went
up
and
down
on
frivolous
pretexts
or
to
amuse
the
baby
as
a
matter
of
fact
elgin
had
begun
as
the
centre
of
trading
for
the
farmers
of
fox
county
and
had
soon
that
limit
in
demand
so
that
when
other
interests
added
themselves
to
the
activity
of
the
town
there
was
still
plenty
of
room
for
the
business
they
brought
main
street
was
really
therefore
not
a
fair
index
nobody
in
elgin
would
have
admitted
it
its
appearance
and
demeanour
would
never
have
suggested
that
it
was
now
the
chief
artery
of
a
thriving
manufacturing
town
with
a
collegiate
institute
eleven
churches
two
newspapers
and
an
asylum
for
the
deaf
and
dumb
to
say
nothing
of
a
fire
department
unsurpassed
for
organization
and
achievement
in
the
province
of
ontario
only
at
twelve
noon
it
might
be
partly
realized
when
the
prolonged
toots
of
seven
factory
whistles
at
once
let
off
so
to
speak
the
hour
elgin
liked
the
demonstration
it
was
held
to
be
cheerful
and
unmistakable
an
indication
of
proclivities
which
spoke
for
itself
it
occurred
while
yet
dr
drummond
and
mr
murchison
stood
together
in
the
store
door
i
must
be
getting
on
said
the
minister
looking
at
his
watch
and
what
news
have
you
of
lorne
well
he
seems
to
have
got
through
all
what
you
ve
heard
already
then
he
telegraphed
from
toronto
on
saturday
mr
murchison
stroked
his
chin
the
better
to
retain
his
satisfaction
waste
of
money
the
post
would
have
brought
it
this
morning
but
it
pleased
his
mother
yes
he
s
through
his
law
schools
examination
and
at
the
top
too
as
far
as
i
can
make
dear
me
and
you
never
mentioned
it
dr
drummond
spoke
with
the
resigned
impatience
of
a
familiar
grievance
it
was
certainly
a
trying
characteristic
of
john
murchison
that
he
never
cared
about
communicating
anything
that
might
seem
to
ask
for
congratulation
well
well
i
m
very
glad
to
hear
it
slipped
my
mind
said
mr
murchison
yes
he
s
barrister
and
solicitor
now
he
can
plead
your
case
or
draw
you
up
a
deed
with
the
best
of
them
lorne
s
made
a
fair
record
so
far
we
ve
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
that
you
have
personal
sentiments
between
these
two
scotchmen
were
indicated
rather
than
indulged
he
s
going
in
with
fulke
and
warner
i
suppose
you
ve
got
that
fixed
up
pretty
well
old
man
warner
was
in
this
morning
to
talk
it
over
he
says
they
look
to
lorne
to
bring
them
in
touch
with
the
new
generation
it
s
a
pity
he
lost
that
son
of
oh
a
great
pity
but
since
they
had
to
go
outside
the
firm
they
couldn
t
have
done
better
they
couldn
t
have
done
better
i
hope
lorne
will
bring
them
a
bit
of
knox
church
business
too
there
s
no
reason
why
bob
mackintosh
should
have
it
all
they
ll
be
glad
to
see
him
back
at
the
hampden
debating
society
he
s
a
great
light
there
is
lorne
and
the
young
liberals
i
hear
are
wanting
him
for
chairman
this
there
s
some
talk
of
it
but
time
enough
time
enough
for
that
he
ll
do
if
he
gets
the
law
to
practise
let
alone
the
making
of
maybe
so
he
s
young
yet
well
good
morning
to
you
i
ll
just
step
over
the
way
to
the
express
office
and
get
a
proof
out
of
them
of
that
sermon
of
mine
i
noticed
their
reporter
fellow
what
s
his
name
rawlins
with
his
pencil
out
last
night
and
i
ve
no
faith
in
better
cast
an
eye
over
it
responded
mr
murchison
cordially
and
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
longer
in
the
door
watching
the
crisp
significant
little
figure
of
the
minister
as
he
stepped
briskly
over
the
crossing
to
the
newspaper
office
there
dr
drummond
sat
down
before
he
explained
his
errand
and
wrote
a
paragraph
we
are
pleased
to
learn
it
ran
that
mr
lorne
murchison
eldest
son
of
mr
john
murchison
of
this
town
has
passed
at
the
capital
of
the
province
his
final
examination
in
law
distinguishing
himself
by
coming
out
at
the
top
of
the
list
it
will
be
remembered
that
mr
murchison
upon
entering
the
law
schools
also
carried
off
a
valuable
scholarship
we
are
glad
to
be
able
to
announce
that
mr
murchison
junior
will
embark
upon
his
profession
in
his
native
town
where
he
will
enter
the
firm
of
fulke
and
the
editor
mr
horace
williams
had
gone
to
dinner
and
rawlins
was
out
so
dr
drummond
had
to
leave
it
with
the
press
foreman
mr
williams
read
it
appreciatively
on
his
return
and
sent
it
down
with
the
following
addition
this
is
doing
it
as
well
as
it
can
be
done
elgin
congratulates
mr
murchison
upon
having
produced
these
results
and
herself
upon
having
produced
mr
chapter
iii
from
the
day
she
stepped
into
it
mrs
murchison
knew
that
the
plummer
place
was
going
to
be
the
bane
of
her
existence
this
may
have
been
partly
because
mr
murchison
had
bought
it
since
a
circumstance
welded
like
that
into
one
s
life
is
very
apt
to
assume
the
character
of
a
bane
unless
one
s
temperament
leads
one
to
philosophy
which
mrs
murchison
s
didn
t
but
there
were
other
reasons
more
difficult
to
traverse
it
was
plainly
true
that
the
place
did
require
a
tremendous
amount
of
looking
after
as
such
things
were
measured
in
elgin
far
more
looking
after
than
the
murchisons
could
afford
to
give
it
they
could
never
have
afforded
in
the
beginning
to
possess
it
had
it
not
been
sold
under
mortgage
at
a
dramatic
sacrifice
the
house
was
a
dignified
old
affair
built
of
wood
and
painted
white
with
wide
green
verandahs
compassing
the
four
sides
of
it
as
they
often
did
in
days
when
the
builder
had
only
to
turn
his
hand
to
the
forest
it
stood
on
the
very
edge
of
the
town
wheatfields
in
the
summer
billowed
up
to
its
fences
and
in
the
autumn
camped
around
it
like
a
besieging
army
the
plank
sidewalk
finished
there
after
that
you
took
the
road
or
if
you
were
so
inclined
the
river
into
which
you
could
throw
a
stone
from
the
orchard
of
the
plummer
place
the
house
stood
roomily
and
shadily
in
ornamental
grounds
with
a
lawn
in
front
of
it
and
a
shrubbery
at
each
side
an
orchard
behind
and
a
vegetable
garden
the
whole
intersected
by
winding
gravel
walks
of
which
mrs
murchison
was
wont
to
say
that
a
man
might
do
nothing
but
weed
them
and
have
his
hands
full
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
was
a
fountain
an
empty
basin
with
a
plaster
triton
most
difficult
to
keep
looking
respectable
and
pathetic
in
his
frayed
air
of
exile
from
some
garden
of
italy
sloping
to
the
sea
there
was
also
a
barn
with
stabling
a
loft
and
big
carriage
doors
opening
on
a
lane
to
the
street
the
originating
plummer
mrs
murchison
often
said
must
have
been
a
person
of
large
ideas
and
she
hoped
he
had
the
money
to
live
up
to
them
the
murchisons
at
one
time
kept
a
cow
in
the
barn
till
a
succession
of
girls
left
on
account
of
the
milking
and
the
lane
was
useful
as
an
approach
to
the
backyard
by
the
teams
that
brought
the
cordwood
in
the
winter
it
was
trying
enough
for
a
person
with
the
instinct
of
order
to
find
herself
surrounded
by
circumstances
which
she
simply
could
not
control
but
mrs
murchison
often
declared
that
she
could
put
up
with
the
grounds
if
it
had
stopped
there
it
did
not
stop
there
though
i
was
compelled
to
introduce
mrs
murchison
in
the
kitchen
she
had
a
in
which
she
might
have
received
the
with
french
windows
and
a
chandelier
and
a
library
with
an
italian
marble
mantelpiece
she
had
an
icehouse
and
a
wine
cellar
and
a
string
of
bells
in
the
kitchen
that
connected
with
every
room
in
the
house
it
was
a
negligible
misfortune
that
not
one
of
them
was
in
order
she
had
far
too
much
as
she
declared
for
any
one
pair
of
hands
and
a
growing
family
and
if
the
ceiling
was
not
dropping
in
the
the
cornice
was
cracked
in
the
library
or
the
gas
was
leaking
in
the
or
the
verandah
wanted
reflooring
if
anyone
coming
to
the
house
was
not
to
put
his
foot
through
it
and
as
to
the
barn
if
it
was
dropping
to
pieces
it
would
just
have
to
drop
the
barn
was
definitely
outside
the
radius
of
possible
amelioration
it
passed
gradually
visibly
into
decrepitude
and
mrs
murchison
often
wished
she
could
afford
to
pull
it
down
it
may
be
realized
that
in
spite
of
its
air
of
being
impossible
to
overtake
i
must
in
this
connection
continue
to
quote
its
mistress
there
was
an
attractiveness
about
the
dwelling
of
the
murchisons
the
attractiveness
of
the
large
ideas
upon
which
it
had
been
built
and
designed
no
doubt
by
one
of
those
gentlefolk
of
reduced
income
who
wander
out
to
the
colonies
with
a
nebulous
view
to
economy
and
occupation
to
perish
of
the
readjustment
the
case
of
such
persons
when
they
arrive
is
at
once
felt
to
be
pathetic
there
is
a
tacit
local
understanding
that
they
have
made
a
mistake
they
may
be
entitled
to
respect
but
nothing
can
save
them
from
the
isolation
of
their
difference
and
their
misapprehension
it
was
like
that
with
the
house
the
house
was
admired
without
enthusiasm
but
it
was
not
copied
it
was
felt
to
be
outside
the
general
need
misjudged
adventitious
and
it
wore
its
superiority
in
the
popular
view
like
a
folly
it
was
in
elgin
but
not
of
it
it
represented
a
different
tradition
and
elgin
made
the
same
allowance
for
its
bedroom
bells
and
its
dignities
as
was
conceded
to
its
original
master
s
habit
of
a
clock
dinner
with
wine
the
architectural
expression
of
the
town
was
on
a
different
scale
beginning
with
frame
rising
through
the
semidetached
culminating
expensively
in
mansard
roofs
cupolas
and
modern
conveniences
and
blossoming
in
extreme
instances
into
moorish
fretwork
and
silk
portieres
for
interior
decoration
the
murchison
house
gained
by
force
of
contrast
one
felt
stepping
into
it
under
influences
of
less
expediency
and
more
dignity
wider
scope
and
more
leisured
intention
its
shabby
spaces
had
a
redundancy
the
pleasanter
and
its
yellow
plaster
cornices
a
charm
the
greater
for
the
numerous
examples
of
contemporary
taste
in
red
brick
which
made
surrounded
by
geranium
beds
so
creditable
an
appearance
in
the
west
ward
john
murchison
in
taking
possession
of
the
house
had
felt
in
it
these
satisfactions
had
been
definitely
penetrated
and
soothed
by
them
the
more
perhaps
because
he
brought
to
them
a
capacity
for
feeling
the
worthier
things
of
life
which
circumstances
had
not
previously
developed
he
seized
the
place
with
a
sense
of
opportunity
leaping
sharp
and
conscious
out
of
early
years
in
the
grey
wynds
of
a
northern
scottish
town
and
its
personality
sustained
him
very
privately
but
none
the
less
effectively
through
the
worry
and
expense
of
it
for
years
he
would
take
his
pipe
and
walk
silently
for
long
together
about
the
untidy
shrubberies
in
the
evening
for
the
acute
pleasure
of
seeing
the
big
horse
chestnuts
in
flower
and
he
never
opened
the
hall
door
without
a
feeling
of
gratification
in
its
weight
as
it
swung
under
his
hand
in
so
far
as
he
could
he
supplemented
the
idiosyncrasies
he
found
the
walls
though
mostly
bare
in
their
french
paper
lavender
and
gilt
a
pattern
held
a
few
good
engravings
the
library
was
reduced
to
contain
a
single
bookcase
but
it
was
filled
with
english
classics
john
murchison
had
been
made
a
careful
man
not
by
nature
by
the
discipline
of
circumstances
but
he
would
buy
books
he
bought
them
between
long
periods
of
abstinence
during
which
he
would
scout
the
expenditure
of
an
unnecessary
dollar
coming
home
with
a
parcel
under
his
arm
for
which
he
vouchsafed
no
explanation
and
which
would
disclose
itself
to
be
lockhart
or
sterne
or
borrow
or
defoe
mrs
murchison
kept
a
discouraging
eye
upon
such
purchases
and
when
her
husband
brought
home
chambers
s
dictionary
of
english
literature
after
shortly
and
definitely
repulsing
her
demand
that
he
should
get
himself
a
new
winter
overcoat
she
declared
that
it
was
beyond
all
endurance
mrs
murchison
was
surrounded
indeed
by
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
than
she
could
find
use
or
excuse
for
since
though
books
made
but
a
sporadic
appearance
current
literature
daily
weekly
and
monthly
was
perpetually
under
her
feet
the
toronto
paper
came
as
a
matter
of
course
as
the
london
daily
takes
its
morning
flight
into
the
provinces
the
local
organ
as
simply
indispensable
the
westminster
as
the
corollary
of
church
membership
and
for
sunday
reading
these
were
constant
but
there
were
also
mutables
once
a
week
good
words
for
the
young
blackwood
s
and
the
cornhill
they
used
to
be
years
of
back
numbers
mrs
murchison
had
packed
away
in
the
attic
where
advena
on
rainy
days
came
into
the
inheritance
of
them
and
made
an
early
acquaintance
with
fiction
in
ready
money
mortiboy
and
verner
s
pride
while
lorne
flat
on
his
stomach
beside
her
had
glorious
hours
on
the
back
of
the
north
wind
their
father
considered
such
publications
and
their
successors
essential
like
tobacco
and
tea
he
was
also
an
easy
prey
to
the
subscription
agent
for
works
published
in
parts
and
paid
for
in
instalments
a
custom
which
mrs
murchison
regarded
with
abhorrence
so
much
so
that
when
john
put
his
name
down
for
masterpieces
of
the
world
s
art
which
was
to
cost
twenty
dollars
by
the
time
it
was
complete
he
thought
it
advisable
to
let
the
numbers
accumulate
at
the
store
whatever
the
place
represented
to
their
parents
it
was
pure
joy
to
the
young
murchisons
it
offered
a
margin
and
a
mystery
to
life
they
saw
it
far
larger
than
it
was
they
invested
it
arguing
purely
by
its
difference
from
other
habitations
with
a
romantic
past
i
guess
when
the
prince
of
wales
came
to
elgin
mother
he
stayed
here
lorne
remarked
as
a
little
boy
secretly
he
and
advena
took
up
boards
in
more
than
one
unused
room
and
rapped
on
more
than
one
thick
wall
to
find
a
hollow
chamber
the
house
revealed
so
much
that
was
interesting
it
was
apparent
to
the
meanest
understanding
that
it
must
hide
even
more
it
was
never
half
lighted
and
there
was
a
passage
in
which
fear
dwelt
wild
were
the
gallopades
from
attic
to
cellar
in
the
early
nightfall
when
every
young
murchison
tore
after
every
other
possessed
like
cats
by
a
demoniac
ecstasy
of
the
gloaming
and
the
garden
with
the
autumn
moon
coming
over
the
apple
trees
and
the
neglected
asparagus
thick
for
ambush
and
a
casual
untrimmed
boy
or
two
with
the
delicious
recommendation
of
being
utterly
without
credentials
to
join
in
the
rout
and
be
trusted
to
make
for
the
back
fence
without
further
hint
at
the
voice
of
mrs
murchison
these
were
joys
of
the
very
fibre
things
to
push
ideas
and
envisage
life
with
an
attraction
that
made
it
worth
while
to
grow
up
and
they
had
all
achieved
it
all
six
they
had
grown
up
sturdily
emerging
into
sobriety
and
decorum
by
much
the
same
degrees
as
the
old
house
under
john
murchison
s
improving
fortunes
grew
cared
for
and
presentable
the
new
roof
went
on
slate
replacing
shingles
the
year
abby
put
her
hair
up
the
bathroom
was
contemporary
with
oliver
s
leaving
school
the
electric
light
was
actually
turned
on
for
the
first
time
in
honour
of
lorne
s
return
from
toronto
a
barrister
and
solicitor
several
rooms
had
been
done
up
for
abby
s
wedding
abby
had
married
early
and
satisfactorily
dr
harry
johnson
who
had
placidly
settled
down
to
await
the
gradual
succession
of
his
father
s
practice
dr
harry
and
dr
henry
they
were
called
dr
harry
lived
next
door
to
dr
henry
and
had
a
good
deal
of
the
old
man
s
popular
manner
it
was
an
unacknowledged
partnership
which
often
provided
two
opinions
for
the
same
price
the
town
prophesied
well
of
it
that
left
only
five
at
home
but
they
always
had
abby
over
in
the
west
ward
where
abby
s
housekeeping
made
an
interest
and
abby
s
baby
a
point
of
pilgrimage
these
considerations
almost
consoled
mrs
murchison
declaring
as
she
did
that
all
of
them
might
have
gone
but
abby
who
alone
knew
how
to
be
any
comfort
or
any
dependence
in
the
house
who
could
be
left
with
a
day
s
preserving
and
i
tell
you
that
to
be
left
by
mrs
murchison
with
a
day
s
preserving
be
it
cherries
or
strawberries
damsons
or
pears
was
a
mark
of
confidence
not
easy
to
obtain
advena
never
had
it
advena
indeed
might
have
married
and
removed
no
prop
of
the
family
economy
mrs
murchison
would
have
been
sorry
for
the
man
she
maintained
a
candour
toward
and
about
those
belonging
to
her
that
permitted
no
illusions
but
she
would
have
stood
cheerfully
out
of
the
way
on
her
own
account
when
you
have
seen
your
daughter
reach
and
pass
the
age
of
without
having
learned
properly
to
make
her
own
bed
you
know
without
being
told
that
she
will
never
be
fit
for
the
management
of
a
house
don
t
you
very
well
then
and
for
ever
and
for
ever
no
matter
what
there
was
to
do
with
a
book
in
her
hand
mrs
murchison
would
put
an
emphasis
on
the
book
which
scarcely
concealed
a
contempt
for
such
absorption
and
if
at
the
end
of
your
patience
you
told
her
for
any
sake
to
put
it
down
and
attend
to
matters
obeying
in
a
kind
of
dream
that
generally
drove
you
to
take
the
thing
out
of
her
hands
and
do
it
yourself
rather
than
jump
out
of
your
skin
watching
her
sincerely
mrs
murchison
would
have
been
sorry
for
the
man
if
he
had
arrived
but
he
had
not
arrived
advena
justified
her
existence
by
taking
the
university
course
for
women
at
toronto
and
afterward
teaching
the
english
branches
to
the
junior
forms
in
the
collegiate
institute
which
placed
her
arbitrarily
outside
the
sphere
of
domestic
criticism
mrs
murchison
was
thankful
to
have
her
there
outside
where
little
more
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
her
than
that
she
should
be
down
in
time
for
breakfast
it
is
so
irritating
to
be
justified
in
expecting
more
than
seems
likely
to
come
mrs
murchison
s
ideas
circulated
strictly
in
the
orbit
of
equity
and
reason
she
expected
nothing
from
anybody
that
she
did
not
expect
from
herself
indeed
she
would
spare
others
in
far
larger
proportion
but
the
sense
of
obligation
which
led
her
to
offer
herself
up
to
the
last
volt
of
her
energy
made
her
miserable
when
she
considered
that
she
was
not
fairly
done
by
in
return
pressed
down
and
running
over
were
the
services
she
offered
to
the
general
good
and
it
was
on
the
ground
of
the
merest
justice
that
she
required
from
her
daughters
some
sort
of
interest
in
domestic
affairs
from
her
eldest
she
got
no
sort
of
interest
and
it
was
like
the
removal
of
a
grievance
from
the
hearth
when
advena
took
up
employment
which
ranged
her
definitely
beyond
the
necessity
of
being
of
any
earthly
use
in
the
house
advena
s
occupation
to
some
extent
absorbed
her
shortcomings
which
was
much
better
than
having
to
attribute
them
to
her
being
naturally
or
naturally
clever
according
to
the
bias
of
the
moment
mrs
murchison
no
longer
excused
or
complained
of
her
daughter
but
she
still
pitied
the
man
the
boys
of
course
were
too
young
to
think
of
matrimony
they
were
still
the
boys
the
murchison
boys
they
would
be
the
boys
at
forty
if
they
remained
under
their
father
s
roof
in
the
mother
country
men
in
short
jackets
and
round
collars
emerge
from
the
preparatory
schools
in
the
daughter
lands
boys
in
tailcoats
conduct
serious
affairs
alec
and
oliver
in
the
business
were
frivolous
enough
as
to
the
feminine
interest
for
all
dr
drummond
s
expressed
and
widely
known
views
upon
the
subject
it
was
a
common
thing
for
one
or
both
of
these
young
men
to
stray
from
the
family
pew
on
sunday
evenings
to
the
services
of
other
communions
thereafter
to
walk
home
in
the
dusk
under
the
maples
with
some
attractive
young
person
and
be
sedately
invited
to
finish
the
evening
on
her
father
s
verandah
neither
of
them
was
guiltless
of
silk
ties
knitted
or
handkerchiefs
initialled
by
certain
fingers
without
repeating
scandal
one
might
say
by
various
fingers
for
while
the
ultimate
import
of
these
matters
was
not
denied
in
elgin
there
was
a
general
feeling
against
giving
too
much
meaning
to
them
probably
originating
in
a
reluctance
among
heads
of
families
to
add
to
their
responsibilities
these
early
spring
indications
were
belittled
and
laughed
at
so
much
so
that
the
young
people
them
selves
hardly
took
them
seriously
but
regarded
them
as
a
form
of
amusement
almost
conventional
nothing
would
have
surprised
or
embarrassed
them
more
than
to
learn
that
their
predilections
had
an
imperative
corollary
that
anything
should
of
necessity
come
of
something
of
course
occasionally
did
come
of
it
and
usually
after
years
of
attention
a
young
man
of
elgin
found
himself
mated
to
a
young
woman
but
never
under
circumstances
that
could
be
called
precipitate
or
rash
the
cautious
blood
and
far
sight
of
the
early
settlers
who
had
much
to
reckon
with
were
still
preponderant
social
characteristics
of
the
town
they
cleared
the
site
for
meanwhile
however
flowers
were
gathered
and
all
sorts
of
evanescent
idylls
came
and
went
in
the
relations
of
young
men
and
maidens
alec
and
oliver
murchison
were
already
in
the
full
tide
of
them
from
this
point
of
view
they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
lorne
it
was
not
as
if
their
brother
were
in
any
way
ill
calculated
to
attract
that
interest
which
gave
to
youthful
existence
in
elgin
almost
the
only
flavour
that
it
had
looks
are
looks
and
lorne
had
plenty
of
them
taller
by
an
inch
than
alec
broader
by
two
than
oliver
with
a
fine
square
head
and
blue
eyes
in
it
and
features
which
conveyed
purpose
and
humour
lighted
by
a
certain
simplicity
of
soul
that
pleased
even
when
it
was
not
understood
open
people
said
he
was
and
frank
so
he
was
frank
and
open
with
horizons
and
intentions
you
could
see
them
in
his
face
perhaps
it
was
more
conscious
of
them
than
he
was
ambition
definitely
shining
goals
adorn
the
perspectives
of
young
men
in
new
countries
less
often
than
is
commonly
supposed
lorne
meant
to
be
a
good
lawyer
squarely
proposed
to
himself
that
the
country
should
hold
no
better
and
as
to
more
selective
usefulness
he
hoped
to
do
a
little
stumping
for
the
right
side
when
frank
jennings
ran
for
the
ontario
house
in
the
fall
it
wouldn
t
be
his
first
electioneering
from
the
day
he
became
chairman
of
the
young
liberals
the
party
had
an
eye
on
him
and
when
occasion
arose
winter
or
summer
by
bobsleigh
or
buggy
weatherbeaten
local
bosses
would
convey
him
to
country
schoolhouses
for
miles
about
to
keep
a
district
sound
on
railway
policy
or
education
or
tariff
reform
he
came
home
smiling
with
the
triumphs
of
these
occasions
and
offered
them
with
the
slow
capable
drawl
that
inspired
such
confidence
in
him
to
his
family
at
breakfast
who
said
great
or
good
for
you
lorne
john
murchison
oftenest
said
nothing
but
would
glance
significantly
at
his
wife
frowning
and
pursing
his
lips
when
she
who
had
most
spirit
of
them
all
would
exclaim
you
ll
be
premier
yet
lorne
it
was
no
part
of
the
murchison
policy
to
draw
against
future
balances
they
might
believe
everything
they
would
express
nothing
and
i
doubt
whether
lorne
himself
had
any
map
of
the
country
he
meant
to
travel
over
in
that
vague
future
already
defining
in
local
approbation
and
law
business
coming
freely
in
with
a
special
eye
on
the
junior
partner
but
the
tract
was
there
subconscious
plain
in
the
wider
glance
the
alerter
manner
plain
even
in
the
grasp
and
stride
which
marked
him
in
a
crowd
plain
too
in
the
preoccupation
with
other
issues
were
it
only
turning
over
a
leader
in
the
morning
s
dominion
that
carried
him
along
indifferent
to
the
allurements
i
have
described
the
family
had
a
bond
of
union
in
their
respect
for
lorne
and
this
absence
of
nugatory
inclinations
in
him
was
among
its
elements
even
stella
who
being
just
fourteen
was
the
natural
mouthpiece
of
family
sentiment
would
declare
that
lorne
had
something
better
to
do
than
go
hanging
about
after
girls
and
for
her
part
she
thought
all
the
more
of
him
for
it
chapter
iv
i
am
requested
to
announce
said
dr
drummond
after
the
singing
of
the
last
hymn
the
death
yesterday
morning
of
james
archibald
ramsay
for
fifteen
years
an
adherent
and
for
years
a
member
of
this
church
the
funeral
will
take
place
from
the
residence
of
the
deceased
on
court
house
street
tomorrow
afternoon
at
four
o
clock
friends
and
acquaintances
are
respectfully
invited
to
the
minister
s
voice
changed
with
the
character
of
its
affairs
still
vibrating
with
the
delivery
of
his
sermon
it
was
now
charged
with
the
official
business
of
the
interment
in
its
inflections
it
expressed
both
elegy
and
eulogy
and
in
the
brief
pause
before
and
after
invited
and
the
fall
of
attend
there
was
the
last
word
of
comment
upon
the
mortal
term
a
crispation
of
interest
passed
over
the
congregation
every
chin
was
raised
dr
drummond
s
voice
had
a
wonderful
claiming
power
but
he
often
said
he
wished
his
congregation
would
pay
as
undivided
attention
to
the
sermon
as
they
did
to
the
announcements
the
usual
weekly
prayer
meeting
will
be
held
in
the
basement
of
the
church
on
wednesday
then
almost
in
a
tone
of
colloquy
and
with
just
a
hint
of
satire
about
his
long
upper
lip
i
should
be
glad
to
see
a
better
attendance
of
the
young
people
at
these
gatherings
time
was
when
the
prayer
meeting
counted
among
our
young
men
and
women
as
an
occasion
not
to
be
lightly
passed
over
in
these
days
it
would
seem
that
there
is
too
much
business
to
be
done
or
too
much
pleasure
to
be
enjoyed
for
the
oncoming
generation
to
remember
their
weekly
engagement
with
the
lord
this
is
not
as
it
should
be
and
i
rely
upon
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
this
congregation
who
brought
these
children
in
their
arms
to
the
baptismal
font
there
to
be
admitted
to
the
good
hopes
and
great
privileges
of
the
church
of
god
i
rely
upon
them
to
see
that
there
shall
be
no
departure
from
the
good
old
rule
and
that
time
is
found
for
the
weekly
prayer
mrs
murchison
nudged
stella
who
returned
the
attention
looking
elaborately
uninterested
with
her
foot
alec
and
oliver
smiled
consciously
their
father
with
an
expression
of
severe
gravity
backed
up
the
minister
who
after
an
instant
s
pause
continued
on
tuesday
afternoon
next
god
willing
i
shall
visit
the
following
families
in
the
east
ward
mr
peterson
mr
macormack
mrs
samuel
smith
and
mr
john
flint
on
thursday
afternoon
in
the
south
ward
mrs
reid
mr
cameron
and
mr
murchison
we
will
close
by
singing
the
third
doxology
blessed
blessed
be
jehovah
israel
s
god
to
all
eternity
the
congregation
trooped
out
the
murchisons
walked
home
in
a
clan
mr
and
mrs
murchison
with
stella
skirting
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
beside
them
the
two
young
men
behind
abby
when
she
married
harry
had
gone
over
to
the
church
of
england
the
wife
must
worship
with
the
husband
even
dr
drummond
recognized
the
necessity
though
he
professed
small
opinion
of
the
sway
of
the
spouse
who
with
presbyterian
traditions
behind
her
could
not
achieve
union
the
other
way
about
and
abby
s
sanctioned
defection
was
a
matter
of
rather
reference
by
her
family
advena
and
lorne
had
fallen
into
the
degenerate
modern
habit
of
preferring
the
evening
service
so
we
re
to
have
the
doctor
on
thursday
said
mrs
murchison
plainly
not
displeased
well
i
hope
the
carpet
will
be
i
expect
he
ll
be
wanting
his
tea
replied
mr
murchison
he
s
got
you
in
the
right
place
on
the
list
for
that
mother
as
i
d
just
like
to
see
him
go
anywhere
else
for
his
tea
the
day
he
was
coming
to
our
house
declared
stella
but
he
generally
has
too
much
you
boys
said
mrs
murchison
turning
back
to
her
sons
will
see
that
you
re
on
hand
that
evening
and
i
hope
the
doctor
will
rub
it
in
about
the
prayer
mrs
murchison
chuckled
i
saw
it
went
home
to
both
of
you
and
well
it
might
yes
i
think
i
may
as
well
expect
him
to
tea
he
enjoys
my
scalloped
oysters
if
i
do
say
it
we
ll
get
abby
over
said
mr
murchison
that
ll
please
the
i
must
say
remarked
stella
he
seems
to
think
a
lot
more
of
abby
now
that
she
s
mrs
episcopal
yes
abby
and
harry
must
come
said
mrs
murchison
and
i
was
thinking
of
inviting
mr
and
mrs
horace
williams
we
ve
been
there
till
i
m
ashamed
to
look
them
in
the
face
and
i
ve
pretty
well
decided
she
added
autocratically
to
have
chicken
salad
so
if
dr
drummond
has
made
up
his
mouth
for
scalloped
oysters
he
ll
be
mother
announced
stella
i
m
perfectly
certain
you
ll
have
i
ll
consider
it
replied
her
mother
meanwhile
we
would
be
better
employed
in
thinking
of
what
we
have
been
hearing
that
s
the
third
sermon
from
the
book
of
job
in
six
weeks
i
must
say
with
the
whole
of
the
two
testaments
to
select
from
i
don
t
see
why
the
doctor
should
be
so
taken
up
with
stella
was
vindicated
mrs
murchison
did
have
both
the
chicken
salad
gleamed
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
the
scalloped
oysters
smoked
delicious
at
the
other
lorne
had
charge
of
the
cold
tongue
and
advena
was
entrusted
with
the
pickled
pears
the
rest
of
the
family
were
expected
to
think
about
the
tea
biscuits
and
the
cake
for
lobelia
had
never
yet
had
a
successor
that
was
any
hand
with
company
mrs
murchison
had
enough
to
do
to
pour
out
the
tea
it
was
a
table
to
do
anybody
credit
with
its
glossy
damask
and
the
silver
and
best
china
that
mrs
murchison
had
brought
as
a
bride
to
her
housekeeping
for
thank
goodness
her
mother
had
known
what
was
what
in
such
matters
a
generous
attractive
table
that
you
took
some
satisfaction
in
looking
at
mrs
murchison
came
of
a
family
of
noted
housekeepers
where
she
got
her
charm
i
don
t
know
clock
tea
and
that
the
last
meal
in
the
day
was
the
rule
in
elgin
and
a
good
enough
rule
for
mrs
murchison
who
had
no
patience
with
the
innovation
of
a
late
dinner
recently
adopted
by
some
people
who
could
keep
neither
their
servants
nor
their
digestions
in
consequence
it
had
been
a
crisp
october
day
as
mr
murchison
remarked
the
fall
evenings
were
beginning
to
draw
in
early
everybody
was
glad
of
the
fire
in
the
grate
and
the
closed
curtains
dr
drummond
had
come
about
five
and
the
inquiries
and
comments
upon
family
matters
that
the
occasion
made
incumbent
had
been
briskly
exchanged
with
just
the
word
that
marked
the
pastoral
visit
and
the
practical
interest
that
relieved
it
and
he
had
thought
on
the
whole
that
he
might
manage
to
stay
to
tea
at
which
mrs
murchison
s
eyes
twinkled
as
she
said
affectionately
now
doctor
you
know
we
could
never
let
you
then
abby
had
arrived
and
her
husband
and
finally
mr
and
mrs
williams
just
a
trifle
late
for
etiquette
but
well
knowing
that
it
mustn
t
be
enough
to
spoil
the
biscuits
dr
drummond
in
the
place
of
honour
had
asked
the
blessing
and
that
brief
reminder
of
the
semiofficial
character
of
the
occasion
having
been
delivered
was
in
the
best
of
humours
the
murchisons
were
not
far
wrong
in
the
happy
divination
that
he
liked
coming
to
their
house
its
atmosphere
appealed
to
him
he
expanded
in
its
humour
its
irregularity
its
sense
of
temperament
they
were
doubtful
allurements
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
minister
of
the
gospel
but
it
would
not
occur
to
dr
drummond
to
analyse
them
so
far
as
he
was
aware
john
murchison
was
just
a
decent
prosperous
christian
man
on
whose
word
and
will
you
might
depend
and
mrs
murchison
a
stirring
independent
little
woman
who
could
be
very
good
company
when
she
felt
inclined
as
to
their
sons
and
daughters
in
so
far
as
they
were
a
credit
he
was
as
proud
of
them
as
their
parents
could
possibly
be
regarding
himself
as
in
a
much
higher
degree
responsible
for
the
formation
of
their
characters
and
the
promise
of
their
talents
and
indeed
since
every
one
of
them
had
sat
under
dr
drummond
from
the
day
he
or
she
was
capable
of
sitting
under
anybody
mr
and
mrs
murchison
would
have
been
the
last
to
dispute
this
it
was
not
one
of
those
houses
where
a
pastor
could
always
be
sure
of
leaving
some
spiritual
benefit
behind
but
then
he
came
away
himself
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
nervous
stimulus
which
was
apt
to
take
his
mind
off
the
matter
it
is
not
given
to
all
of
us
to
receive
or
to
extend
the
communion
of
the
saints
mr
and
mrs
murchison
were
indubitably
of
the
elect
but
he
was
singularly
about
it
and
she
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
seeing
the
humorous
side
altogether
it
was
paralysing
and
the
conversation
would
wonderfully
soon
slip
round
to
some
robust
secular
subject
public
or
domestic
i
have
mentioned
dr
drummond
s
long
upper
lip
all
sorts
of
racial
virtues
resided
there
but
his
mouth
was
also
wide
and
much
frequented
by
a
critical
humorous
philosophical
smile
which
revealed
a
view
of
life
at
once
kindly
and
trenchant
his
shrewd
grey
eyes
were
encased
in
wrinkles
and
when
he
laughed
his
hearty
laugh
they
almost
disappeared
in
a
merry
line
he
had
a
fund
of
scotch
stories
and
one
or
two
he
was
very
fond
of
at
the
expense
of
the
methodists
that
were
known
up
and
down
the
dominion
and
nobody
enjoyed
them
more
than
he
did
himself
he
had
once
worn
his
hair
in
a
high
curl
on
his
scholarly
forehead
and
a
silvering
tuft
remained
brushed
upright
he
took
the
precaution
of
putting
cotton
wool
in
his
ears
which
gave
him
more
than
ever
the
look
of
something
highly
concentrated
and
conserved
but
in
no
way
detracted
from
his
dignity
st
andrew
s
folk
accused
him
of
vanity
because
of
the
diamond
he
wore
on
his
little
finger
he
was
by
no
means
handsome
but
he
was
intensely
individual
perhaps
he
had
vanity
his
people
would
have
forgiven
him
worse
things
and
at
mrs
murchison
s
tea
party
he
was
certainly
as
john
murchison
afterward
said
in
fine
an
absorbing
topic
held
them
a
local
topic
a
topic
involving
loss
and
crime
and
reprisals
the
federal
bank
had
sustained
a
robbery
of
five
thousand
dollars
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
had
placed
their
cashier
under
arrest
for
suspected
complicity
their
cashier
was
walter
ormiston
the
only
son
of
old
squire
ormiston
of
moneida
reservation
ten
miles
out
of
elgin
who
had
administered
the
affairs
of
the
indians
there
for
more
years
than
the
federal
bank
had
existed
mr
williams
brought
the
latest
news
as
was
to
be
expected
news
flowed
in
rivulets
to
mr
williams
all
day
long
he
paid
for
it
dealt
in
it
could
spread
or
suppress
it
they
ve
admitted
the
bail
mr
williams
announced
with
an
air
of
rawlins
had
brought
the
intelligence
in
too
late
for
the
current
issue
and
mr
williams
was
divided
between
his
human
desire
to
communicate
and
his
journalistic
sense
that
the
item
would
be
the
main
feature
of
the
next
afternoon
s
express
i
m
glad
of
that
i
m
glad
of
that
repeated
dr
drummond
thank
you
mrs
murchison
i
ll
send
my
cup
and
did
you
learn
williams
for
what
amount
mr
williams
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
in
the
effort
to
remember
and
decided
that
he
might
as
well
let
it
all
go
the
mercury
couldn
t
fail
to
get
it
by
tomorrow
anyhow
three
thousand
he
said
milburn
and
dr
henry
i
thought
father
was
bound
to
be
in
it
remarked
dr
harry
half
and
half
asked
john
murchison
no
contributed
mrs
williams
mr
milburn
two
and
dr
henry
one
mr
milburn
is
walter
s
uncle
you
mr
williams
fastened
an
outraged
glance
on
his
wife
who
looked
another
way
whatever
he
thought
proper
to
do
it
was
absolutely
understood
that
she
was
to
reveal
nothing
of
what
came
in
and
was
even
carefully
to
conserve
anything
she
heard
outside
with
a
view
to
bringing
it
in
mrs
williams
was
too
prone
to
indiscretion
in
the
matter
of
letting
news
slip
prematurely
and
as
to
its
capture
her
husband
would
often
confess
with
private
humour
that
minnie
wasn
t
much
of
a
mouser
well
that
s
something
to
be
thankful
for
said
mrs
murchison
i
lay
awake
for
two
hours
last
night
thinking
of
that
boy
in
jail
and
his
poor
old
father
years
of
age
and
such
a
fine
old
man
so
thoroughly
i
don
t
know
the
young
fellow
said
dr
drummond
but
they
say
he
s
of
good
character
not
but
bears
a
clean
reputation
they
re
all
tories
together
of
course
the
it
s
an
old
loyalist
family
remarked
advena
mr
ormiston
has
one
or
two
rather
interesting
revolutionary
trophies
at
his
house
out
none
the
worse
for
that
none
the
worse
for
that
said
dr
drummond
old
ormiston
s
father
contributed
the
editor
of
the
express
had
a
crown
grant
of
the
whole
of
moneida
reservation
at
one
time
government
actually
bought
it
back
from
him
to
settle
the
indians
there
he
was
a
family
compact
man
and
fought
tooth
and
nail
for
the
clergy
reserves
in
well
well
said
dr
drummond
with
a
twinkle
we
ll
hope
young
ormiston
is
innocent
nasty
business
for
the
federal
bank
if
he
is
mr
williams
went
on
they
re
a
pretty
unpopular
bunch
as
it
of
course
he
s
innocent
contributed
stella
with
indignant
eyes
and
when
they
prove
it
what
can
he
do
to
the
bank
for
taking
him
up
that
s
what
i
want
to
her
elders
smiled
indulgently
a
lot
you
know
about
it
kiddie
said
oliver
it
was
the
only
remark
he
made
during
the
meal
alec
passed
the
butter
assiduously
but
said
nothing
at
all
adolescence
was
inarticulate
in
elgin
on
occasions
of
ceremony
i
hear
they
ve
piled
up
some
big
evidence
said
mr
williams
young
ormiston
s
been
fool
enough
to
do
some
lately
minnie
i
wish
you
d
get
mrs
murchison
to
show
you
how
to
pickle
pears
of
course
he
added
they
re
keeping
it
up
their
it
s
a
hard
place
to
keep
evidence
said
lorne
murchison
at
last
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
throw
light
on
the
matter
they
had
all
been
waiting
more
or
less
consciously
for
what
lorne
would
have
to
say
lorne
you
ve
got
it
divined
his
mother
instantly
got
what
mother
the
case
i
ve
suspected
it
from
the
minute
the
subject
was
mentioned
that
case
came
in
today
and
you
sitting
there
like
a
bump
on
a
log
and
never
telling
us
exclaimed
stella
with
reproach
stella
you
have
a
great
deal
too
much
to
say
replied
her
brother
suppose
you
try
sitting
like
a
bump
on
a
log
we
won
t
complain
yes
the
squire
seems
to
have
made
up
his
mind
about
the
defence
and
my
seniors
haven
t
done
much
else
rawlins
saw
him
hitched
up
in
front
of
your
place
for
about
two
hours
this
morning
said
mr
williams
i
told
him
i
thought
that
was
good
enough
but
we
didn
t
say
anything
rawlins
having
heard
it
was
to
be
flynn
from
toronto
and
i
hadn
t
forgotten
the
grand
trunk
case
we
put
down
to
you
last
week
without
exactly
askin
your
old
man
was
as
mad
as
a
hornet
wanted
to
stop
his
subscription
rawlins
had
no
end
of
a
time
to
get
round
him
little
things
like
that
will
creep
in
when
you
ve
got
to
trust
to
one
man
to
run
the
whole
local
show
but
i
didn
t
want
the
mercury
to
have
another
horse
on
do
you
think
you
ll
get
a
look
in
lorne
asked
dr
harry
oh
not
a
chance
of
it
the
old
man
s
as
keen
as
a
razor
on
the
case
and
you
d
think
warner
never
had
one
before
if
i
get
a
bit
of
grubbing
to
do
under
supervision
they
ll
consider
i
ought
to
be
it
was
the
sunniest
possible
tone
of
grumbling
it
enlisted
your
sympathy
by
its
very
acknowledgement
that
it
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
they
re
pretty
wild
about
it
out
moneida
way
said
dr
harry
my
father
says
the
township
would
put
down
the
bail
three
times
they
swear
by
the
squire
out
there
said
mr
horace
williams
liberally
applying
his
napkin
to
his
moustache
he
treated
some
of
them
more
than
square
when
the
fall
wheat
failed
three
years
running
about
ten
years
back
do
you
remember
mr
murchison
lent
them
money
at
about
half
the
bank
rate
and
wasn
t
in
an
awful
sweat
about
getting
it
in
at
that
and
wasn
t
there
something
about
his
rebuilding
the
at
his
own
expense
not
so
long
ago
asked
dr
drummond
just
what
he
did
i
wanted
to
send
rawlins
out
and
make
a
story
of
it
we
d
have
given
it
a
column
with
full
heads
but
the
old
man
didn
t
like
it
it
s
hard
to
know
what
some
people
will
like
but
it
was
my
own
foolishness
for
asking
a
thing
like
that
is
public
there
s
a
good
deal
of
feeling
said
lorne
so
much
that
i
understand
the
bank
is
moving
for
change
of
i
hope
they
won
t
get
it
said
dr
drummond
sharply
a
strong
local
feeling
is
valuable
evidence
in
a
case
like
this
i
don
t
half
approve
this
notion
that
a
community
can
t
manage
its
own
justice
when
it
happens
to
take
an
interest
in
the
case
i
ve
no
more
acquaintance
with
the
squire
than
how
d
ye
do
and
i
don
t
know
his
son
from
adam
but
i
d
serve
on
the
jury
tomorrow
if
the
crown
asked
it
and
there
s
many
more
like
mr
williams
who
had
made
a
brief
note
on
his
shirt
cuff
restored
his
pencil
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
shall
oppose
a
change
of
venue
said
he
chapter
v
it
was
confidently
expected
by
the
murchison
family
that
when
stella
was
old
enough
she
would
be
a
good
deal
in
society
stella
without
doubt
was
well
equipped
for
society
she
had
exactly
those
qualities
which
appealed
to
it
in
elgin
among
which
i
will
mention
two
the
quality
of
being
able
to
suggest
that
she
was
quite
as
good
as
anybody
without
saying
so
and
the
even
more
important
quality
of
not
being
any
better
other
things
being
equal
those
common
worldly
standards
that
prevailed
in
elgin
as
well
as
anywhere
else
in
their
degree
other
things
being
equal
this
second
simple
quality
was
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
mr
and
mrs
murchison
made
no
claim
and
small
attempt
upon
society
one
doubts
whether
with
children
coming
fast
and
hard
times
long
at
the
door
they
gave
the
subject
much
consideration
but
if
they
did
it
is
highly
unlikely
to
have
occurred
to
them
that
they
were
too
good
for
their
environment
yet
in
a
manner
they
were
it
was
a
matter
of
quality
of
spiritual
and
mental
fabric
they
were
hardly
aware
that
they
had
it
but
it
marked
them
with
a
difference
and
a
difference
is
the
one
thing
a
small
community
accustomed
comfortably
to
scan
its
own
intelligible
averages
will
not
tolerate
the
unusual
may
take
on
an
exaggeration
of
these
an
excess
of
money
an
excess
of
piety
is
understood
but
idiosyncrasy
susceptible
to
no
common
translation
is
regarded
with
the
hostility
earned
by
the
white
crow
modified
among
humans
into
tacit
repudiation
it
is
a
sound
enough
social
principle
to
distrust
that
which
is
not
understood
like
the
strain
of
temperament
inarticulate
but
vaguely
manifest
in
the
murchisons
such
a
strain
may
any
day
produce
an
eccentric
or
a
genius
emancipated
from
the
common
interests
possibly
inimical
to
the
general
good
and
when
later
on
your
genius
takes
flight
or
your
eccentric
sells
all
that
he
has
and
gives
it
to
the
poor
his
fellow
townsmen
exchange
shrewd
nods
before
the
vindicating
fact
nobody
knew
it
at
all
in
elgin
but
this
was
the
murchisons
case
they
had
produced
nothing
abnormal
but
they
had
to
prove
that
they
weren
t
going
to
and
stella
was
the
last
and
most
convincing
demonstration
advena
bookish
and
unconventional
was
regarded
with
dubiety
she
was
out
of
the
type
she
had
queer
satisfactions
and
enthusiasms
once
as
a
little
girl
she
had
taken
a
papoose
from
a
drunken
squaw
and
brought
it
home
for
her
mother
to
adopt
mrs
murchison
s
reception
of
the
suggested
duty
may
be
imagined
also
the
comments
of
acquaintances
a
trick
like
that
the
inevitable
hour
arrived
when
she
should
be
instructed
on
the
piano
and
the
second
time
the
music
teacher
came
her
pupil
was
discovered
on
the
roof
of
the
house
with
the
ladder
drawn
up
after
her
she
did
not
wish
to
learn
the
piano
and
from
that
point
of
vantage
informed
her
family
that
it
was
a
waste
of
money
she
would
hide
in
the
hayloft
with
a
novel
she
would
be
off
by
herself
in
a
canoe
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
would
go
for
walks
in
the
rain
of
windy
october
twilights
and
be
met
kicking
the
wet
leaves
along
in
front
of
her
in
a
no
one
could
dream
with
impunity
in
elgin
except
in
bed
mothers
of
daughters
sympathized
in
good
set
terms
with
mrs
murchison
if
that
girl
were
mine
they
would
say
and
leave
you
with
a
stimulated
notion
of
the
value
of
corporal
punishment
when
she
took
to
passing
examinations
and
teaching
elgin
considered
that
her
parents
ought
to
be
thankful
in
the
probability
that
she
had
escaped
some
dramatic
end
but
her
occupation
further
removed
her
from
intercourse
with
the
town
s
more
exclusive
circles
she
had
taken
a
definite
line
and
she
pursued
it
preoccupied
if
she
was
a
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
she
sent
up
a
little
curl
of
reflection
in
a
safe
place
where
she
was
not
further
interrupted
abby
inheriting
all
these
prejudices
had
nevertheless
not
done
so
badly
she
had
taken
no
time
at
all
to
establish
herself
she
had
almost
immediately
married
in
the
social
estimates
of
elgin
the
johnsons
were
nice
people
dr
henry
was
a
fine
old
figure
in
the
town
and
abby
s
chances
were
good
enough
at
all
events
when
she
opened
her
doors
as
a
bride
receiving
for
three
afternoons
in
her
wedding
dress
everybody
had
it
was
very
distinctly
understood
of
course
that
this
was
a
civility
that
need
not
lead
to
anything
whatever
a
kind
of
bowing
recognition
to
be
formally
returned
and
quite
possibly
to
end
there
with
abby
in
a
good
many
cases
it
hadn
t
ended
there
she
was
doing
very
well
and
as
she
often
said
with
private
satisfaction
if
she
went
out
anywhere
she
was
just
as
likely
as
not
to
meet
her
brothers
elgin
society
shaping
itself
i
suppose
to
ultimate
increase
and
prosperity
had
this
peculiarity
that
the
females
of
a
family
in
general
acceptance
were
apt
to
lag
far
behind
the
males
alec
and
oliver
enjoyed
a
good
deal
of
popularity
and
it
was
stella
s
boast
that
if
lorne
didn
t
go
out
much
it
needn
t
be
supposed
he
wasn
t
asked
it
was
an
accepted
state
of
things
in
elgin
that
young
men
might
be
invited
without
their
sisters
implying
an
imperturbability
greater
than
london
s
since
london
may
not
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
sisters
while
elgin
knew
all
sorts
of
more
interesting
things
about
them
the
young
men
were
more
desirable
than
the
young
women
they
forged
ahead
carrying
the
family
fortunes
and
the
nicest
of
them
were
the
young
men
in
the
banks
others
might
be
more
substantial
but
there
was
an
allure
about
a
young
man
in
a
bank
as
difficult
to
define
as
to
resist
to
say
of
a
certain
that
she
had
about
every
bank
clerk
in
town
was
to
announce
the
success
of
her
entertainment
in
ultimate
terms
these
things
are
not
always
penetrable
but
no
doubt
his
gentlemanly
form
of
labour
and
its
abridgement
in
the
afternoons
when
other
young
men
toiled
on
till
the
stroke
of
six
had
something
to
do
with
this
apotheosis
of
the
bank
clerk
as
well
as
his
invariable
taste
in
tailoring
and
the
fact
that
some
local
family
influence
was
probably
represented
in
his
appointment
privilege
has
always
its
last
little
stronghold
and
it
still
operates
to
admiration
on
the
office
stools
of
minor
finance
in
towns
like
elgin
at
all
events
the
sprouting
tellers
and
cashiers
held
unquestioned
sway
young
doctors
and
lawyers
simply
didn
t
think
of
competing
and
since
this
sort
of
thing
carries
its
own
penalty
the
designation
which
they
shared
with
so
many
distinguished
persons
in
history
became
a
byword
on
the
lips
of
envious
persons
and
small
boys
by
which
they
wished
to
express
effeminacy
and
the
substantive
of
the
d
ye
take
me
fur
a
bank
clurk
was
a
form
of
repudiation
among
corner
loafers
as
forcible
as
it
was
unjustifiable
i
seem
to
have
embarked
by
way
of
getting
to
the
milburns
party
there
is
a
party
at
the
milburns
and
some
of
us
are
going
upon
an
analysis
of
social
principles
in
elgin
an
adventure
of
difficulty
as
i
have
once
or
twice
hinted
but
one
from
which
i
can
not
well
extricate
myself
without
at
least
leaving
a
clue
or
two
more
for
the
use
of
the
curious
no
doubt
these
rules
had
their
nucleus
in
the
families
among
whom
we
may
count
the
shadowy
plummers
who
took
upon
themselves
for
fox
county
by
the
king
s
pleasure
the
administration
of
justice
the
practice
of
medicine
and
of
the
law
and
the
performance
of
the
charges
of
the
church
of
england
a
long
time
ago
such
persons
would
bring
their
lines
of
demarcation
with
them
and
in
their
new
milieu
of
backwoods
settlers
and
small
traders
would
find
no
difficulty
in
drawing
them
again
but
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
the
little
knot
of
soon
found
the
limitations
of
their
new
conditions
years
went
by
in
decades
aggrandizing
none
of
them
they
took
perforce
to
the
ways
of
the
country
and
soon
nobody
kept
a
groom
but
the
doctor
and
nobody
dined
late
but
the
judge
there
came
a
time
when
the
sheriff
s
whist
club
and
the
archdeacon
s
port
became
a
tradition
to
the
oldest
inhabitant
trade
flourished
education
improved
politics
changed
her
majesty
removed
her
troops
the
dominion
wouldn
t
pay
a
business
and
a
bulwark
went
with
the
regiment
the
original
dignified
group
broke
dissolved
scattered
prosperous
traders
foreclosed
them
the
spirit
of
the
times
defeated
them
young
liberals
succeeded
them
in
office
their
grandsons
married
the
daughters
of
persons
who
came
from
the
north
of
ireland
the
east
of
scotland
and
the
lord
knows
where
it
was
a
sorry
tale
of
disintegration
with
a
cheerful
sequel
of
rebuilding
leading
to
a
little
unavoidable
confusion
as
the
edifice
went
up
any
process
of
blending
implies
confusion
to
begin
with
we
are
here
at
the
making
of
a
nation
this
large
consideration
must
dispose
of
small
anomalies
such
as
the
acceptance
without
cant
of
certain
forms
of
the
shop
euphemized
as
the
store
but
containing
the
same
old
vertebral
counter
not
all
forms
were
held
in
respect
and
chemists
in
comparative
esteem
house
furnishings
and
hardware
made
an
appreciable
claim
and
quite
a
leading
family
was
occupied
with
seed
grains
groceries
on
the
other
hand
were
harder
to
swallow
possibly
on
account
of
the
apron
though
the
grocer
s
apron
being
of
linen
had
several
degrees
more
consideration
than
the
shoemaker
s
which
was
of
leather
smaller
trades
made
smaller
pretensions
mrs
milburn
could
tell
you
where
to
draw
the
line
they
were
all
folk
together
but
they
had
their
little
prejudices
the
dentist
was
known
as
doc
but
he
was
not
considered
quite
on
a
medical
level
it
was
doubtful
whether
you
bowed
to
the
and
quite
a
curious
and
unreasonable
contempt
was
bound
up
in
the
word
anything
wholesale
or
manufacturing
stood
of
course
on
its
own
feet
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
in
molasses
nothing
objectionable
in
a
tannery
nothing
amusing
in
soap
such
airs
and
graces
were
far
from
elgin
too
fundamentally
occupied
with
the
amount
of
capital
invested
and
too
profoundly
aware
how
hard
it
was
to
come
by
the
valuable
part
of
it
all
was
a
certain
bright
freedom
and
this
was
of
the
essence
trade
was
a
decent
communal
way
of
making
a
living
rooted
in
independence
and
the
general
need
it
had
none
of
the
meaner
aspects
your
bow
was
negligible
to
the
and
everything
veterinary
held
up
its
head
and
all
this
again
qualified
as
everywhere
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
social
faculty
that
magnetic
capacity
for
coming
as
mrs
murchison
would
say
to
the
fore
which
makes
little
of
disadvantages
that
might
seem
insuperable
and
in
default
renders
null
and
void
the
most
unquestionable
claims
anyone
would
think
of
the
delarues
mr
delarue
had
in
the
dim
past
married
his
milliner
yet
the
delarues
were
now
very
much
indeed
to
the
fore
and
on
the
other
hand
the
leverets
of
the
saw
mills
rich
and
benevolent
the
leverets
were
not
in
society
simply
if
you
analysed
it
because
they
did
not
appear
to
expect
to
be
in
it
certainly
it
was
well
not
to
be
too
modest
assuredly
as
mrs
murchison
said
you
put
your
own
ticket
on
though
that
dear
soul
never
marked
herself
in
very
plain
figures
not
knowing
perhaps
for
one
thing
quite
how
much
she
was
worth
on
the
other
hand
scarce
of
company
welcome
trumpery
mrs
murchison
always
emphatically
declared
to
be
no
part
of
her
social
philosophy
the
upshot
was
that
the
murchisons
were
confined
to
a
few
old
friends
and
looked
as
we
know
for
more
brilliant
excursions
to
stella
and
the
it
was
only
however
the
pleasure
of
mr
lorne
murchison
s
company
that
was
requested
at
the
milburns
dance
almost
alone
among
those
who
had
slipped
into
wider
and
more
promiscuous
circles
with
the
widening
of
the
stream
the
milburns
had
made
something
like
an
effort
to
hold
out
the
resisting
power
was
not
thought
to
reside
in
mr
milburn
who
was
personally
aware
of
no
special
ground
for
it
but
in
mrs
milburn
and
her
sister
miss
filkin
who
seemed
to
have
inherited
the
strongest
ideas
in
the
phrase
of
the
place
about
keeping
themselves
to
themselves
a
strain
of
this
kind
is
sometimes
constant
even
so
far
from
the
fountainhead
with
its
pleasing
proof
that
such
views
were
once
the
most
general
and
the
most
sacred
defence
of
firesides
and
that
thackeray
had
after
all
a
good
deal
to
excuse
him
crossing
the
atlantic
they
doubtless
suffered
some
dilution
but
all
that
was
possible
to
conserve
them
under
very
adverse
conditions
mrs
milburn
and
miss
filkin
made
it
their
duty
to
do
nor
were
these
ideas
opposed
contested
or
much
traversed
in
elgin
it
was
recognized
that
there
was
something
about
mrs
milburn
and
her
sister
vaguely
felt
that
you
did
not
come
upon
that
thinness
of
nostril
and
slope
of
shoulder
and
set
of
elbow
at
every
corner
they
must
have
got
it
somewhere
a
filkin
tradition
prevailed
said
to
have
originated
in
nova
scotia
the
filkins
never
had
been
accessible
but
if
they
wanted
to
keep
to
themselves
let
them
in
this
respect
dora
milburn
the
only
child
was
said
to
be
her
mother
s
own
daughter
the
shoulders
at
all
events
testified
to
it
and
the
young
lady
had
been
taught
to
speak
like
mrs
milburn
with
what
was
known
as
an
english
the
accent
in
general
use
in
elgin
was
borrowed
let
us
hope
temporarily
from
the
other
side
of
the
line
it
suffered
local
modifications
and
exaggerations
but
it
was
clearly
an
american
product
the
english
accent
was
thoroughly
affected
especially
the
broad
the
time
may
come
when
elgin
will
be
at
considerable
pains
to
teach
itself
the
broad
a
but
that
is
in
the
embroidery
of
the
future
and
in
no
way
modifies
the
criticism
of
dora
milburn
lorne
murchison
however
was
invited
to
the
dance
the
invitation
reached
him
through
the
post
coming
home
from
office
early
on
saturday
he
produced
it
from
his
pocket
mrs
murchison
and
abby
sat
on
the
verandah
enjoying
the
indian
summer
afternoon
the
horse
chestnuts
dropped
crashing
among
the
fallen
leaves
the
roadside
maples
blazed
the
quiet
streets
ran
into
smoky
purple
and
one
belated
robin
hopped
about
the
lawn
mrs
murchison
had
just
remarked
that
she
didn
t
know
why
at
this
time
of
year
you
always
felt
as
if
you
were
waiting
for
something
well
i
hope
you
feel
honoured
remarked
abby
not
one
of
them
would
have
thought
that
lorne
should
feel
especially
honoured
but
the
insincerity
was
so
obvious
that
it
didn
t
matter
mrs
murchison
cocking
her
head
to
read
the

tried
hard
not
to
look
pleased
mrs
milburn
at
home
she
read
dancing
well
she
might
be
at
home
dancing
for
all
me
why
couldn
t
she
just
write
you
a
little
friendly
note
or
let
dora
do
it
it
s
that
ormiston
case
she
went
on
shrewdly
they
know
you
re
taking
a
lot
of
trouble
about
it
and
the
least
they
could
do
lorne
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
stuck
his
long
legs
out
in
front
of
him
oh
i
don
t
know
he
said
they
have
the
name
of
being
nifty
but
i
haven
t
got
anything
against
the
name
ejaculated
mrs
murchison
now
long
ago
was
it
the
episcopalians
began
that
business
for
the
destitute
clergy
of
saskatchewan
mother
put
in
abby
with
deprecation
well
i
won
t
be
certain
about
the
clergy
but
i
tell
you
it
had
to
do
with
saskatchewan
for
that
i
remember
and
anyhow
the
first
meeting
was
held
at
the
milburns
members
lent
their
well
mrs
leveret
and
mrs
delarue
went
to
the
meeting
they
were
very
thick
just
then
the
leverets
and
the
delarues
they
were
so
pleased
to
be
going
that
they
got
there
about
five
minutes
too
soon
and
they
were
the
first
to
come
well
they
rang
the
bell
and
in
they
went
the
girl
showed
them
into
the
front
and
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
there
in
the
back
sat
mrs
milburn
and
miss
filkin
and
never
spoke
to
them
took
not
the
smallest
notice
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
stray
cats
not
so
much
their
own
denomination
mind
you
too
and
there
they
might
have
been
sitting
still
if
mrs
leveret
hadn
t
had
the
spirit
to
get
up
and
march
out
no
thank
you
no
milburns
for
lorne
watched
his
mother
with
twinkling
eyes
till
she
finished
well
mother
after
that
if
it
was
going
to
be
a
sewing
circle
i
think
i
d
send
an
excuse
he
said
but
maybe
they
won
t
be
so
mean
at
a
chapter
vi
octavius
milburn
would
not
i
think
have
objected
to
being
considered
with
relation
to
his
own
line
in
life
a
representative
man
he
would
have
been
wary
to
claim
it
but
if
the
stranger
had
arrived
unaided
at
this
view
of
him
he
would
have
been
inclined
to
think
well
of
the
stranger
s
power
of
induction
that
is
what
he
was
a
man
of
averages
balances
the
safe
level
no
more
disposed
to
an
extravagant
opinion
than
to
wear
one
side
whisker
longer
than
the
other
you
would
take
him
any
day
especially
on
sunday
in
a
silk
hat
for
the
correct
medium
by
his
careful
walk
with
the
spring
in
it
his
shrewd
glance
with
the
caution
in
it
his
look
of
being
prepared
to
account
for
himself
categorically
from
head
to
foot
he
was
fond
of
explaining
in
connection
with
an
offer
once
made
him
to
embark
his
capital
in
chicago
that
he
preferred
a
fair
living
under
his
own
flag
to
a
fortune
under
the
stars
and
stripes
there
we
have
the
turn
of
his
mind
convertible
into
the
language
of
bookkeeping
a
balance
struck
with
the
profit
on
the
side
of
the
flag
the
patriotic
equivalent
in
good
sound
terms
of
dollars
and
cents
with
this
position
understood
he
was
prepared
to
take
you
up
on
any
point
of
comparison
between
the
status
and
privileges
of
a
subject
and
a
citizen
the
political
morale
of
a
monarchy
and
a
republic
the
advantage
of
life
on
this
and
the
other
side
of
the
line
there
was
nothing
he
liked
better
to
expatiate
upon
with
that
valuable
proof
of
his
own
sincerity
always
at
hand
for
reference
and
illustration
his
ideal
was
life
in
a
practical
colony
far
enough
from
england
actually
to
be
disabused
of
her
inherited
anachronisms
and
make
your
own
tariff
near
enough
politically
to
keep
your
securities
up
by
virtue
of
her
protection
he
was
extremely
satisfied
with
his
own
country
one
saw
in
his
talk
the
phenomenon
of
patriotism
in
double
bloom
flower
within
flower
i
have
mentioned
his
side
whiskers
he
preserved
that
facial
decoration
of
the
prince
consort
and
the
large
steel
engraving
that
represents
queen
victoria
in
a
flowing
habit
and
the
prince
in
a
frock
coat
and
a
stock
on
horseback
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
in
his
if
the
outer
patriotism
was
a
little
vague
the
inner
had
vigour
enough
canada
was
a
great
place
mr
milburn
had
been
born
in
the
country
and
had
never
gone
over
to
england
canada
was
good
enough
for
him
he
was
born
one
might
say
in
the
manufacturing
interest
and
inherited
the
complacent
and
conservative
political
views
of
a
tenderly
nourished
industry
mr
milburn
was
of
those
who
were
building
up
the
country
with
sufficient
protection
he
was
prepared
to
go
on
doing
it
long
and
loyally
meanwhile
he
admired
the
structure
from
all
points
of
view
as
president
of
the
elgin
chamber
of
commerce
he
was
enabled
once
a
year
to
produce
no
end
of
gratifying
figures
he
was
fond
of
wearing
on
such
occasions
the
national
emblem
in
a
little
enamelled
maple
leaf
and
his
portrait
and
biography
occupied
a
full
page
in
a
sumptuous
work
entitled
canadians
of
today
sold
by
subscription
where
he
was
described
as
the
father
of
the
elgin
mr
and
mrs
milburn
were
in
the
to
receive
their
young
guests
a
circumstance
which
alone
imparted
a
distinction
to
the
entertainment
at
such
parties
the
appearance
of
the
heads
of
the
house
was
by
no
means
invariable
frequently
they
went
to
bed
the
simple
explanation
was
that
the
young
people
could
stand
late
hours
and
be
none
the
worse
next
day
their
elders
had
to
be
more
careful
if
they
wanted
to
get
down
to
business
moreover
as
in
all
new
societies
between
the
older
and
the
younger
generation
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
across
which
intercourse
was
difficult
the
sons
and
daughters
born
to
different
circumstances
evolved
their
own
conventions
the
old
people
used
the
ways
and
manners
of
narrower
days
one
paralysed
the
other
it
might
be
gathered
from
the
slight
tone
of
patronage
in
the
address
of
youth
to
age
that
the
advantage
lay
with
the
former
but
polite
conversation
at
best
was
sustained
with
discomfort
such
considerations
however
were
far
from
operating
with
the
milburns
mrs
milburn
would
have
said
that
they
were
characteristic
of
quite
a
different
class
of
people
and
so
they
were
no
one
would
have
supposed
from
the
way
in
which
the
family
disposed
itself
in
the
that
miss
filkin
had
only
just
finished
making
the
claret
cup
or
that
dora
had
been
cutting
sandwiches
till
the
last
minute
or
that
mrs
milburn
had
been
obliged
to
have
a
distinct
understanding
with
the
maid
mrs
milburn
s
servants
were
all
maids
even
the
charwoman
who
had
buried
three
husbands
on
the
subject
of
wearing
a
cap
when
she
answered
the
door
mrs
milburn
sat
on
a
chair
she
had
worked
herself
occupied
with
something
in
the
new
stitch
dora
performed
lightly
at
the
piano
miss
filkin
dipped
into
selections
from
the
poets
of
the
century
placed
as
remotely
as
possible
from
the
others
mr
milburn
with
his
legs
crossed
turned
and
folded
a
toronto
evening
paper
mrs
milburn
had
somewhat
objected
to
the
evening
paper
in
the
won
t
you
look
at
a
magazine
octavius
she
said
but
mr
milburn
advanced
the
argument
that
it
removed
any
appearance
of
stiffness
and
prevailed
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
group
more
disengaged
from
the
absurd
fuss
that
precedes
a
party
among
some
classes
of
people
indeed
when
mr
lorne
murchison
arrived
like
the
unfortunate
mrs
leveret
and
mrs
delarue
he
was
the
first
they
looked
almost
surprised
to
see
him
lorne
told
his
mother
afterward
that
he
thought
in
that
embarrassing
circumstance
of
mrs
leveret
and
mrs
delarue
and
they
laughed
consumedly
together
over
his
discomforture
but
what
he
felt
at
the
moment
was
not
the
humour
of
the
situation
to
be
the
very
first
and
solitary
arrival
is
nowhere
esteemed
the
happiest
fortune
but
in
elgin
a
kind
of
ridiculous
humiliation
attached
to
it
a
greed
for
the
entertainment
a
painful
unsophistication
a
young
man
of
elgin
would
walk
up
and
down
in
the
snow
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
the
thermometer
at
zero
to
escape
the
ignominy
of
it
lorne
murchison
would
have
so
walked
our
young
man
was
potentially
capable
of
not
minding
by
next
morning
he
didn
t
mind
but
immediately
he
was
fast
tied
in
the
cobwebs
of
the
common
prescription
and
he
made
his
way
to
each
of
the
points
of
the
compass
of
the
milburns
to
shake
hands
burning
to
the
ears
before
he
subsided
into
a
chair
near
mr
milburn
he
grasped
the
collar
of
his
dress
coat
on
each
side
and
drew
it
forward
a
trick
he
had
with
his
gown
in
court
a
nervous
and
mechanical
action
dora
who
continued
to
play
watched
him
over
the
piano
with
an
amusement
not
untinged
with
malice
she
was
a
tall
fair
girl
with
several
kinds
of
cleverness
she
did
her
hair
quite
beautifully
and
she
had
a
remarkable
effective
useful
reticence
her
father
declared
that
dora
took
in
a
great
deal
more
than
she
ever
gave
out
an
accomplishment
in
mr
milburn
s
eyes
on
the
soundest
basis
she
looked
remarkably
pretty
and
had
remarkably
good
style
and
as
she
proceeded
with
her
mazurka
she
was
thinking
he
has
never
been
asked
here
before
how
perfectly
silly
he
must
feel
coming
so
early
presently
as
lorne
grew
absorbed
in
talk
and
forgot
his
unhappy
chance
she
further
reflected
i
don
t
think
i
ve
ever
seen
him
till
now
in
evening
dress
it
does
make
him
a
good
this
went
on
behind
a
faultless
coiffure
and
an
expression
almost
classical
in
its
detachment
but
if
miss
milburn
could
have
thought
on
a
level
with
her
looks
i
for
one
would
hesitate
to
take
any
liberty
with
her
meditations
however
the
bell
began
to
ring
with
the
briefest
intermissions
the
maid
in
the
cap
to
make
constant
journeys
she
opened
the
door
with
a
welcoming
smile
having
practically
no
deportment
to
go
with
the
cap
human
nature
does
not
freeze
readily
anywhere
dora
had
to
leave
the
piano
miss
filkin
decided
that
when
fifteen
had
come
she
would
change
her
chair
fifteen
soon
came
the
young
ladies
mostly
in
light
silks
or
muslins
cut
square
not
low
in
the
neck
with
this
moderation
was
prescribed
in
elgin
where
evening
dress
was
more
a
matter
of
material
than
of
cut
a
thing
in
itself
symbolical
if
it
were
desirable
to
consider
social
evolution
here
for
ladies
high
necks
and
long
sleeves
were
usual
and
mrs
milburn
might
almost
have
been
expected
to
appear
thus
in
a
nicely
made
black
broche
perhaps
it
was
recognized
as
like
mrs
milburn
in
keeping
with
her
unbending
ideas
to
wear
a
dress
cut
as
square
as
any
young
lady
s
with
just
a
little
lace
let
in
of
a
lavender
stripe
the
young
men
were
nearly
all
in
the
tailor
s
convention
for
their
sex
the
world
over
with
here
and
there
a
short
coat
that
also
went
to
church
but
there
some
departures
from
orthodoxy
in
the
matter
of
collars
and
ties
and
where
white
bows
were
achieved
i
fear
none
of
the
wearers
would
have
dreamed
of
defending
them
from
the
charge
of
being
it
was
a
clear
cold
january
night
and
everybody
as
usual
walked
to
the
party
the
snow
creaked
and
ground
underfoot
one
could
hear
the
arriving
steps
in
the
they
stamped
and
scraped
to
get
rid
of
it
in
the
porch
and
hurried
through
the
hall
muffled
figures
in
overshoes
to
emerge
from
an
upstairs
bedroom
radiant
putting
a
last
touch
to
hair
and
button
hole
smelling
of
the
fresh
winter
air
such
gatherings
usually
consisted
entirely
of
bachelors
and
maidens
with
one
or
two
exceptions
so
recently
yoked
together
that
they
had
not
yet
changed
the
plane
of
existence
married
people
by
general
consent
left
these
amusements
to
the
unculled
they
had
as
i
have
hinted
more
serious
preoccupations
something
else
to
do
nobody
thought
of
inviting
them
nobody
that
is
but
mrs
milburn
and
a
few
others
of
her
way
of
thinking
who
saw
more
elegance
and
more
propriety
in
a
mixture
on
this
occasion
she
had
asked
her
own
clergyman
the
rector
of
st
stephen
s
and
mrs
emmett
who
wore
that
pathetic
expression
of
fragile
wives
and
mothers
who
have
also
a
congregation
at
their
skirts
walter
winter
was
there
too
mr
winter
had
the
distinction
of
having
contested
south
fox
in
the
conservative
interest
three
time
unsuccessfully
undeterred
he
went
on
contesting
things
invariably
beaten
he
invariably
came
up
smiling
and
ready
to
try
again
his
imperturbability
was
a
valuable
asset
he
never
lost
heart
or
dreamed
of
retiring
from
the
arena
nor
did
he
ever
cease
to
impress
his
party
as
being
their
most
useful
and
acceptable
representative
his
business
history
was
chequered
and
his
exact
financial
equivalent
uncertain
but
he
had
tremendously
the
air
of
a
man
of
affairs
as
the
phrase
went
he
was
full
of
politics
the
plain
repository
of
deep
things
he
had
a
shrewd
eye
a
double
chin
and
a
bluff
crisp
jovial
manner
of
talking
as
he
lay
back
in
an
armchair
with
his
legs
crossed
and
played
with
his
watch
chain
an
important
way
of
nodding
assent
a
weighty
shake
of
denial
voting
on
purely
party
lines
the
town
had
later
rewarded
his
invincible
expectation
by
electing
him
mayor
and
then
provided
itself
with
unlimited
entertainment
by
putting
in
a
liberal
majority
on
his
council
the
reports
of
the
weekly
sittings
being
constantly
considered
as
good
as
a
cake
walk
south
fox
as
people
said
was
not
a
healthy
locality
for
conservatives
yet
walter
winter
wore
a
look
of
remarkable
hardiness
he
had
also
tremendously
the
air
of
a
dark
horse
the
result
both
of
natural
selection
and
careful
cultivation
even
his
political
enemies
took
it
kindly
when
he
got
in
for
mayor
and
offered
him
amused
congratulations
he
made
a
personal
claim
on
their
cordiality
which
was
not
the
least
of
his
political
resources
nature
had
fitted
him
to
public
uses
the
impression
overflowed
the
ranks
of
his
own
supporters
and
softened
asperity
among
his
opponents
illustration
lies
at
this
moment
close
to
us
they
had
not
been
in
the
same
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
was
in
deep
and
affectionate
converse
with
lorne
murchison
whose
party
we
know
and
whose
political
weight
was
increasing
as
this
influence
often
does
with
a
rapidity
out
of
proportion
with
his
professional
and
general
significance
it
s
a
pity
now
said
mr
winter
with
genial
interest
you
can
t
get
that
ormiston
defence
into
your
own
hands
very
useful
thing
for
the
younger
man
shifted
a
little
uncomfortably
in
his
seat
it
is
one
thing
to
entertain
a
private
vision
and
another
to
see
it
materialized
on
other
lips
oh
i
d
like
it
well
enough
he
said
but
it
s
out
of
the
question
of
course
i
m
too
small
there
s
a
lot
of
feeling
for
old
ormiston
folks
out
there
on
the
reserve
don
t
know
how
to
show
it
they
ve
shown
it
a
great
deal
too
much
we
don
t
want
to
win
on
feeling
or
have
it
said
either
and
we
were
as
near
as
possible
having
to
take
the
case
to
the
hamilton
i
guess
you
were
i
guess
you
mr
winter
s
suddenly
increased
gravity
expressed
his
appreciation
of
the
danger
i
saw
lister
of
the
bank
the
day
they
heard
from
toronto
rule
refused
never
saw
a
man
more
put
out
seems
they
considered
the
thing
as
good
as
settled
general
opinion
was
it
would
go
to
hamilton
sure
well
i
don
t
know
how
you
pulled
it
off
but
it
was
a
smart
piece
of
work
lorne
encountered
mr
winter
s
frank
smile
with
an
expression
of
crude
and
rather
stolid
discomfort
it
had
a
base
of
indignation
corrected
by
a
concession
to
the
common
idea
that
most
events
with
an
issue
pendent
were
the
result
of
a
smart
piece
of
work
a
kind
of
awkward
shrug
was
in
it
he
had
no
desire
to
be
unpleasant
to
walter
winter
on
the
contrary
nevertheless
an
uncompromising
line
came
on
each
side
of
his
mouth
with
his
reply
as
far
as
i
know
he
said
the
application
was
dismissed
on
its
of
course
it
was
said
mr
winter
you
don
t
need
to
tell
me
that
well
now
this
looks
like
dancing
miss
filkin
i
see
is
going
to
oblige
on
the
piano
now
i
wonder
whether
i
m
going
to
get
miss
dora
to
give
me
a
waltz
or
chairs
and
table
were
in
effect
being
pushed
back
and
folding
doors
opened
which
disclosed
another
room
prepared
for
this
relaxation
miss
filkin
began
to
oblige
vigorously
on
the
piano
miss
dora
granted
mr
winter
s
request
which
he
made
with
elaborate
humour
as
an
impudent
old
bachelor
whom
the
boys
would
presently
take
outside
and
kill
lorne
watched
him
make
it
envying
him
his
assurance
and
miss
milburn
was
aware
that
he
watched
and
aware
that
he
envied
the
room
filled
with
gaiety
and
movement
mr
milburn
sidling
dramatically
along
the
wall
to
escape
the
rotatory
couples
admonished
mr
murchison
to
get
a
partner
he
withdrew
himself
from
the
observation
of
miss
dora
and
mr
winter
and
approached
a
young
lady
on
a
sofa
who
said
with
very
great
when
the
dance
was
over
he
the
young
lady
on
the
sofa
and
fanned
her
with
energy
looking
across
the
room
he
saw
that
walter
winter
seated
beside
dora
was
fanning
himself
he
thought
it
disgusting
and
for
some
reason
which
he
did
not
pause
to
explore
exactly
like
winter
he
had
met
miss
milburn
once
or
twice
before
without
seeing
her
in
any
special
way
here
at
home
the
centre
of
the
little
conventions
that
at
once
protected
and
revealed
her
conventions
bound
up
in
the
impressive
figures
of
her
mother
and
her
aunt
she
had
a
new
interest
and
all
the
attraction
of
that
which
is
not
easily
come
by
it
is
also
possible
that
although
lorne
had
met
her
before
she
had
not
met
him
she
was
meeting
him
now
for
the
first
time
as
she
sat
directly
opposite
and
talked
very
gracefully
to
walter
winter
addressing
walter
winter
lorne
was
the
object
of
her
pretty
remarks
while
mr
winter
had
her
superficial
attention
he
was
the
bland
medium
which
handed
her
on
her
consciousness
was
fixed
on
young
mr
murchison
quite
occupied
with
him
she
could
not
imagine
why
they
had
not
asked
him
long
ago
he
wasn
t
exactly
swell
but
you
could
see
he
was
somebody
so
already
she
figured
the
potential
distinction
in
the
set
of
his
shoulders
and
the
carriage
of
his
head
it
might
have
been
translated
in
simple
terms
of
integrity
and
force
by
anyone
who
looked
for
those
things
miss
milburn
was
incapable
of
such
detail
but
she
saw
truly
enough
in
the
mass
lorne
on
the
opposite
sofa
looked
at
her
across
the
town
s
traditions
of
milburn
exclusiveness
oddly
enough
at
this
moment
when
he
might
have
considered
that
he
had
overcome
them
they
seemed
to
gather
force
exactly
in
his
line
of
vision
he
had
never
before
been
so
near
dora
milburn
and
he
had
never
before
perceived
her
so
remote
he
had
a
sense
of
her
distance
beyond
those
few
yards
of
carpet
quite
incompatible
with
the
fact
it
weighed
upon
him
but
until
she
sent
him
a
sudden
unexpected
smile
he
did
not
know
how
heavily
it
was
a
dissipating
smile
nothing
remained
before
it
lorne
carefully
restored
his
partner
s
fan
bowed
before
her
and
went
straight
across
the
room
chapter
vii
it
is
determined
with
something
like
humour
that
communities
very
young
should
occupy
themselves
almost
altogether
with
matters
of
grave
and
serious
import
the
vision
of
life
at
that
period
is
no
doubt
unimpeded
and
clear
its
conditions
offer
themselves
with
a
certain
nakedness
and
force
both
as
to
this
world
and
to
that
which
is
to
come
the
town
of
elgin
thus
knew
two
controlling
interests
the
interest
of
politics
and
the
interest
of
religion
both
are
terms
we
must
nevertheless
circumscribe
politics
wore
a
complexion
strictly
local
provincial
or
dominion
the
last
step
of
france
in
siam
the
disputed
influence
of
germany
in
the
persian
gulf
the
struggle
of
the
powers
in
china
were
not
matters
greatly
talked
over
in
elgin
the
theatre
of
european
diplomacy
had
no
absorbed
spectators
here
nor
can
i
claim
that
interest
in
the
affairs
of
great
britain
was
in
any
way
extravagant
a
sentiment
of
affection
for
the
reigning
house
certainly
prevailed
it
was
arbitrary
rococo
unrelated
to
current
conditions
as
a
tradition
sung
down
in
a
ballad
an
anachronism
of
the
heart
cherished
through
long
rude
lifetimes
for
the
beauty
and
poetry
of
it
when
you
consider
beauty
and
poetry
can
be
thought
of
in
this
here
was
no
court
aiding
the
transmutation
of
the
middle
class
no
king
spending
money
here
were
no
picturesque
contacts
of
royalty
and
the
people
no
pageantry
no
blazonry
of
the
past
nothing
to
lift
the
heart
but
an
occasional
telegram
from
the
monarch
expressing
upon
an
event
of
public
importance
a
suitable
emotion
yet
the
common
love
for
the
throne
amounted
to
a
enthusiasm
that
burned
with
something
like
a
sacred
flame
and
was
among
the
things
not
ordinarily
alluded
to
because
of
the
shyness
that
attaches
to
all
feeling
that
can
not
be
justified
in
plain
terms
a
sentiment
of
affection
for
the
reigning
house
certainly
prevailed
but
it
was
a
thing
by
itself
the
fall
of
a
british
government
would
hardly
fail
to
excite
comment
and
the
retirement
of
a
prime
minister
would
induce
both
the
mercury
and
the
express
to
publish
a
biographical
sketch
of
him
considerably
shorter
than
the
leader
embodying
the
editor
s
views
as
to
who
should
get
the
electric
light
contract
but
the
government
might
become
the
sole
employer
of
labour
in
those
islands
church
and
school
might
part
company
for
ever
landlords
might
be
deprived
of
all
but
compassionate
allowances
and
except
for
the
degree
of
extravagance
involved
in
these
propositions
they
would
hardly
be
current
in
elgin
the
complications
of
england
s
foreign
policy
were
less
significant
still
it
was
recognized
dimly
that
england
had
a
foreign
policy
more
or
less
had
to
have
it
as
they
would
have
said
in
elgin
it
was
part
of
the
huge
unnecessary
scheme
of
things
for
which
she
was
responsible
unnecessary
from
elgin
s
point
of
view
as
a
father
s
financial
obligations
might
be
to
a
child
he
had
parted
with
at
birth
it
all
lay
outside
the
facts
of
life
far
beyond
the
actual
horizon
like
the
affairs
of
a
distant
relation
from
whom
one
has
nothing
to
hope
not
even
personal
contact
and
of
whose
wealth
and
greatness
one
does
not
boast
much
because
of
the
irony
involved
information
upon
all
these
matters
was
duly
put
before
elgin
every
morning
in
the
telegrams
of
the
toronto
papers
the
information
came
until
the
other
day
over
cables
to
new
york
and
was
disseminated
by
american
news
agencies
it
was
therefore
not
devoid
of
bias
but
if
this
was
perceived
it
was
by
no
means
thought
a
matter
for
protesting
measures
especially
as
they
would
be
bound
to
involve
expense
the
injury
was
too
vague
too
remote
to
be
more
than
sturdily
discounted
by
a
mental
attitude
belief
in
england
was
in
the
blood
it
would
not
yield
to
the
temporary
distortion
of
facts
in
the
newspapers
at
all
events
it
would
not
yield
with
a
rush
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
insidious
sapping
was
precisely
what
the
country
was
too
indifferent
to
discover
indifferent
apathetic
until
whenever
down
the
wind
across
the
atlantic
came
the
faint
far
music
of
the
call
to
arms
then
the
old
dog
of
war
that
has
his
kennel
in
every
man
rose
and
shook
himself
and
presently
there
would
be
a
baying
the
sense
of
kinship
lying
too
deep
for
the
touch
of
ordinary
circumstance
quickened
to
that
and
in
a
moment
we
were
fighting
we
had
lost
or
won
apart
however
from
the
extraordinary
the
politics
of
elgin
s
daily
absorption
were
those
of
the
town
the
province
the
dominion
centres
of
small
circumference
yield
a
quick
swing
the
concern
of
the
average
intelligent
englishman
as
to
the
consolidation
of
his
country
s
interests
in
the
yangtse
valley
would
be
a
languid
manifestation
beside
that
of
an
elgin
elector
in
the
chances
of
an
appropriation
for
a
new
court
house
the
single
mind
is
the
most
fervid
elgin
had
few
distractions
from
the
question
of
the
court
house
or
the
branch
line
to
clayfield
the
arts
conspired
to
be
absent
letters
resided
at
the
nearest
university
city
science
was
imported
as
required
in
practical
improvements
there
was
nothing
indeed
to
interfere
with
elgin
s
attention
to
the
immediate
the
vital
the
municipal
one
might
almost
read
this
concentration
of
interest
in
the
white
dust
of
the
rambling
streets
and
the
shutters
closed
against
it
like
other
movements
of
the
single
mind
it
had
something
of
the
ferocious
of
the
inflexible
of
the
unintelligent
but
it
proudly
wore
the
character
of
the
and
as
walter
winter
would
have
pointed
out
to
you
it
had
granted
eleven
bonuses
to
capture
sound
commercial
concerns
in
six
years
in
wholesome
fear
of
mistake
one
would
hesitate
to
put
church
matters
either
before
or
after
politics
among
the
preoccupations
of
elgin
it
would
be
safer
and
more
indisputable
to
say
that
nothing
compared
with
religion
but
politics
and
nothing
compared
with
politics
but
religion
in
offering
this
proposition
also
we
must
think
of
our
dimensions
there
is
a
religious
fervour
in
oxford
in
mecca
in
benares
and
the
sign
for
these
ideas
is
the
same
we
have
to
apply
ourselves
to
the
interpretation
in
elgin
religious
fervour
was
not
beautiful
or
dramatic
or
it
was
reasonable
you
were
perhaps
your
own
first
creditor
after
that
your
debt
was
to
your
maker
you
discharged
this
obligation
in
a
spirit
of
sturdy
equity
if
the
children
didn
t
go
to
sunday
school
you
knew
the
reason
why
the
habit
of
church
attendance
was
not
only
a
basis
of
respectability
but
practically
the
only
one
a
person
who
was
never
known
to
put
his
head
inside
a
church
door
could
not
be
more
severely
reprobated
by
mrs
murchison
at
all
events
it
was
the
normal
thing
the
thing
which
formed
the
backbone
of
life
sustaining
to
the
serious
impressive
to
the
light
indispensable
to
the
rest
and
the
thing
that
was
more
than
any
of
these
which
you
can
only
know
when
you
stand
in
the
churches
among
the
congregations
within
its
prescribed
limitations
it
was
for
many
the
intellectual
exercise
for
more
the
emotional
lift
and
for
all
the
unfailing
distraction
of
the
week
the
repressed
magnetic
excitement
in
gatherings
of
familiar
faces
bound
by
the
same
convention
to
the
same
kind
of
behaviour
is
precious
in
communities
where
the
human
interest
is
still
thin
and
sparse
it
is
valuable
in
itself
and
it
produces
an
occasional
detached
sensation
there
was
the
case
in
dr
drummond
s
church
of
saintly
old
sandy
macquhot
the
epileptic
it
used
to
be
a
common
regret
with
lorne
murchison
that
as
sure
as
he
was
allowed
to
stay
away
from
church
sandy
would
have
a
fit
that
was
his
little
boy
s
honesty
the
elders
enjoyed
the
fit
and
deprecated
the
disturbance
there
was
a
simple
and
definite
family
feeling
within
communions
they
come
to
our
church
was
the
argument
of
first
force
whether
for
calling
or
for
charity
it
was
impossible
to
feel
toward
a
congregationalist
or
an
episcopalian
as
you
felt
toward
one
who
sang
the
same
hymns
and
sat
under
the
same
admonition
week
by
week
year
in
and
year
out
as
yourself
wesleyans
are
they
a
lady
of
knox
church
would
remark
of
the
newly
arrived
in
whom
her
interest
was
suggested
then
let
the
wesleyans
look
after
a
had
a
distinct
status
an
adherent
enjoyed
friendly
consideration
especially
if
he
adhered
faithfully
and
stray
attendants
from
other
congregations
were
treated
with
punctilious
hospitality
places
being
found
for
them
in
the
old
testament
as
if
they
could
hardly
be
expected
to
discover
such
things
for
themselves
the
religious
interest
had
also
the
strongest
domestic
character
in
quite
another
sense
from
that
of
the
family
prayers
which
dr
drummond
was
always
enjoying
set
your
own
house
in
order
and
then
your
own
church
was
a
wordless
working
precept
in
elgin
threadbare
carpet
in
the
aisles
was
almost
as
personal
a
reproach
as
a
hole
under
the
table
and
was
barely
possible
to
a
congregation
that
sat
in
faded
pews
the
minister
s
gown
even
was
the
subject
of
scrutiny
as
the
years
went
on
it
was
an
expensive
thing
to
buy
but
an
oyster
supper
would
do
it
and
leave
something
over
for
the
organ
which
brings
us
to
the
very
core
and
centre
of
these
activities
their
pivot
their
focus
and
in
a
human
sense
their
inspiration
the
minister
himself
the
minister
was
curiously
special
among
a
people
so
general
he
was
in
a
manner
raised
in
life
on
weekdays
as
he
was
in
the
pulpit
on
sundays
he
had
what
one
might
call
prestige
some
form
of
authority
still
survived
in
his
person
to
which
the
spiritual
democracy
he
presided
over
gave
a
humorous
voluntary
assent
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
person
of
undetermined
leisure
what
was
writing
two
sermons
a
week
to
earn
your
living
by
and
he
was
probably
the
more
reverend
or
the
more
revered
from
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
house
all
day
a
particular
importance
attached
to
everything
he
said
and
did
he
was
a
person
whose
life
answered
different
springs
and
was
sustained
on
quite
another
principle
than
that
of
supply
and
demand
the
province
of
public
criticism
was
his
but
his
people
made
up
for
the
meekness
with
which
they
sat
under
it
by
a
generous
use
of
the
corresponding
privilege
in
private
comments
upon
the
minister
partook
of
hardiness
it
was
as
if
the
members
were
determined
to
live
up
to
the
fact
that
the
could
reduce
his
salary
if
they
liked
needless
to
say
they
never
did
like
congregations
stood
loyally
by
their
pastors
and
discussion
was
strictly
intramural
if
the
methodists
handed
theirs
on
at
the
end
of
three
years
with
a
breath
of
relief
they
exhaled
it
among
themselves
after
all
for
them
it
was
a
matter
of
luck
the
presbyterians
as
in
the
case
of
old
mr
jamesion
of
st
andrew
s
held
on
till
death
pulling
a
long
upper
lip
election
was
not
a
thing
to
be
trifled
with
in
heaven
or
upon
earth
it
will
be
imagined
whether
dr
drummond
did
not
see
in
these
conditions
his
natural
and
wholesome
element
whether
he
did
not
fit
exactly
in
the
god
he
loved
to
worship
as
jehovah
had
made
him
a
beneficent
despot
and
given
him
as
it
were
a
commission
if
the
temporal
power
had
charged
him
to
rule
an
eastern
province
he
would
have
brought
much
the
same
qualities
to
the
task
knox
church
elgin
was
his
dominion
its
moral
and
material
affairs
his
jealous
interest
and
its
legitimate
expansion
his
chief
pride
in
anniversary
sermons
which
he
always
announced
the
sunday
before
he
seldom
refrained
from
contrasting
the
number
on
the
roll
of
church
membership
then
and
now
with
the
particular
increase
in
the
year
just
closed
if
the
increase
was
satisfactory
he
made
little
comment
beyond
the
duty
of
thanksgiving
figures
spoke
for
themselves
if
it
was
otherwise
dr
drummond
s
displeasure
was
not
a
thing
he
would
conceal
he
would
wing
it
eloquently
on
the
shaft
of
his
grief
that
the
harvest
had
been
so
light
but
he
would
more
than
hint
the
possibility
that
the
labourers
had
been
few
most
important
among
his
statistics
was
the
number
of
young
communicants
wanderers
from
other
folds
he
admitted
with
a
not
wholly
satisfied
eye
upon
their
early
theological
training
and
to
persons
duly
accredited
from
presbyterian
churches
elsewhere
he
gave
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
but
the
young
people
of
his
own
congregation
were
his
chief
concern
always
and
if
a
gratifying
number
of
these
had
failed
to
come
forward
during
the
year
the
responsibility
must
lie
somewhere
dr
drummond
was
willing
to
take
his
own
share
the
ministrations
of
this
pulpit
would
be
more
than
suspected
of
having
come
short
and
the
admission
would
enable
him
to
tax
the
rest
upon
parents
and
teachers
with
searching
effect
the
congregation
would
go
gloomily
home
to
dinner
and
old
sandy
macquhot
would
remark
to
his
wife
it
s
hard
to
say
why
will
the
doctor
get
himself
in
sic
a
state
aboot
mere
numbers
we
re
told
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
but
the
doctor
s
all
for
a
grand
knox
church
under
such
auspices
could
hardly
fail
to
enlarge
her
borders
but
elgin
enlarged
hers
faster
almost
before
you
knew
where
you
were
there
spread
out
the
district
of
east
elgin
all
stacks
of
tall
chimneys
and
rows
of
little
houses
east
elgin
was
not
an
attractive
locality
it
suffered
from
inundation
sometimes
when
the
river
was
in
spring
flood
it
gave
unresentful
room
to
a
tannery
it
was
the
home
of
dubious
practices
at
the
polls
and
the
invariable
for
domestic
servants
nevertheless
in
the
view
of
knox
church
it
could
not
bear
a
character
wholly
degraded
too
many
presbyterians
scotch
foremen
and
others
had
their
respectable
residence
there
for
these
it
was
a
far
cry
to
dr
drummond
in
bad
weather
and
there
began
to
be
talk
of
hiring
the
east
elgin
schoolhouse
for
sunday
exercises
if
suitable
persons
could
be
got
to
come
over
from
knox
church
and
lead
them
i
do
not
know
who
was
found
to
broach
the
matter
to
dr
drummond
report
says
his
relative
and
housekeeper
mrs
forsyth
who
perhaps
might
do
it
under
circumstances
of
strategical
advantage
mrs
forsyth
or
whoever
it
was
had
her
reply
in
the
hidden
terms
of
an
equation
was
it
any
farther
for
the
people
of
east
elgin
to
walk
to
hear
him
preach
than
for
him
to
walk
to
minister
to
the
people
of
east
elgin
which
he
did
quite
once
a
week
and
if
so
how
much
mrs
forsyth
or
whoever
it
was
might
eliminate
the
unknown
quantity
it
can
not
be
said
that
dr
drummond
discouraged
the
project
he
simply
did
not
mention
it
and
as
it
was
known
to
have
been
communicated
to
him
this
represented
effectively
the
policy
of
the
closed
door
he
found
himself
even
oftener
in
east
elgin
walking
about
on
his
pastoral
errands
with
a
fierce
briskness
of
aspect
and
a
sharp
inquiring
eye
before
which
one
might
say
the
proposition
slunk
away
meanwhile
the
methodists
who
it
seemed
could
tolerate
decentralization
or
anything
short
of
round
dances
opened
a
chapel
with
a
cheerful
sociable
and
popularized
the
practice
of
backsliding
among
those
for
whom
the
position
was
theologically
impossible
good
presbyterians
in
east
elgin
began
to
turn
into
makeshift
methodists
the
doctor
missed
certain
occupants
of
the
gallery
seats
and
felt
the
logic
of
circumstances
here
we
must
all
yield
and
the
minister
concealed
his
discomfiture
in
a
masterly
initiative
the
matter
came
up
again
at
a
meeting
of
the
church
managers
brought
up
by
dr
drummond
who
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
that
a
thing
put
into
the
doctor
s
hands
was
already
half
done
in
a
very
few
weeks
it
was
entirely
done
the
use
of
the
schoolhouse
was
granted
through
dr
drummond
s
influence
with
the
board
free
of
charge
and
to
understand
the
triumph
of
this
it
should
be
taken
into
account
that
three
of
the
trustees
were
wesleyans
services
were
held
regularly
certain
of
dr
drummond
s
elders
officiating
and
the
conventicle
in
the
schoolhouse
speedily
became
known
as
knox
church
mission
it
grew
and
prospered
the
first
night
i
to
the
hills
will
lift
mine
eyes
went
up
from
east
elgin
on
the
uplifting
tune
that
belongs
to
it
the
strayed
came
flocking
back
this
kind
never
go
forth
again
once
they
refind
the
ark
of
the
covenant
there
they
abide
in
the
course
of
time
it
became
a
question
of
a
better
one
and
money
was
raised
locally
to
build
it
dr
drummond
pronounced
the
first
benediction
in
knox
mission
church
and
waited
well
knowing
human
nature
in
its
presbyterian
aspect
for
the
next
development
it
came
and
not
later
than
he
anticipated
in
the
form
of
a
prayer
to
knox
church
for
help
to
obtain
the
services
of
a
regularly
ordained
minister
dr
drummond
had
his
guns
ready
he
opposed
the
application
where
a
regularly
ordained
minister
was
already
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
chose
to
walk
a
mile
and
a
half
to
hear
him
the
luxury
of
more
locally
consecrated
services
should
be
at
the
charge
of
the
locality
he
himself
was
willing
to
spend
and
be
spent
in
the
spiritual
interests
of
east
elgin
that
was
abundantly
proven
what
he
could
not
comfortably
tolerate
was
the
deviation
of
congregational
funds
the
very
blood
of
the
body
of
belief
into
other
than
legitimate
channels
he
fought
for
his
view
with
all
his
tactician
s
resources
putting
up
one
after
another
to
endorse
it
but
the
matter
was
decided
at
the
general
yearly
meeting
of
the
congregation
and
the
occasion
showed
knox
church
in
singular
sympathy
with
its
struggling
offspring
dr
drummond
for
the
first
time
in
his
ministry
was
defeated
by
his
people
it
was
less
a
defeat
than
a
defence
an
unexpected
rally
round
the
corporate
right
to
direct
corporate
activities
and
the
congregation
was
so
anxious
to
wound
the
minister
s
feelings
as
little
as
possible
that
the
grant
in
aid
of
the
east
elgin
mission
was
embodied
in
a
motion
to
increase
dr
drummond
s
salary
by
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
the
doctor
with
a
wry
joke
swallowed
his
gilded
pill
but
no
coating
could
dissimulate
its
bitterness
and
his
chagrin
was
plain
for
long
the
issue
with
which
we
are
immediately
concerned
is
that
three
months
later
knox
church
mission
called
to
minister
to
it
the
reverend
hugh
finlay
a
young
man
from
dumfriesshire
and
not
long
out
dr
drummond
had
known
beforehand
what
their
choice
would
be
he
had
brought
mr
finlay
to
occupy
knox
church
pulpit
during
his
last
july
and
august
vacation
and
mrs
forsyth
had
reported
that
such
midsummer
congregations
she
had
simply
never
worshipped
with
mrs
forsyth
was
an
excellent
hand
at
pressed
tongue
and
a
wonder
at
knitted
counterpanes
but
she
had
not
acquired
tact
and
never
would
chapter
viii
the
suggestion
that
the
reverend
hugh
finlay
preached
from
the
pulpit
of
knox
church
better
sermons
than
its
permanent
occupant
would
have
been
justly
considered
absurd
and
nobody
pronounced
it
the
church
was
full
as
mrs
forsyth
observed
on
these
occasions
but
there
were
many
other
ways
of
accounting
for
that
the
murchisons
as
a
family
would
have
been
the
last
to
make
such
an
admission
the
regular
attendance
might
have
been
as
much
as
anything
out
of
deference
to
the
wishes
of
the
doctor
himself
who
invariably
and
sternly
hoped
in
his
last
sermon
that
no
stranger
occupying
his
place
would
have
to
preach
to
empty
pews
he
was
thinking
of
course
of
old
mr
jamieson
with
whom
he
occasionally
exchanged
and
whose
effect
on
the
attendance
had
not
failed
to
reach
him
with
regard
to
mr
jamieson
he
was
compelled
in
the
end
to
resort
to
tactics
he
omitted
to
announce
the
sunday
before
that
his
venerable
neighbour
would
preach
and
the
congregation
outwitted
had
no
resource
but
to
sustain
the
old
gentleman
through
seventhly
to
the
finish
there
came
a
time
when
the
dear
human
doctor
also
omitted
to
announce
that
mr
finlay
would
preach
but
for
other
reasons
meanwhile
as
mrs
forsyth
said
he
had
no
difficulty
in
conjuring
a
vacation
congregation
for
his
young
substitute
they
came
trooping
old
and
young
mr
and
mrs
murchison
would
survey
their
creditable
family
rank
with
a
secret
compunction
remembering
its
invariable
gaps
at
other
times
and
then
resolutely
turn
to
the
praise
of
god
with
the
reflection
that
one
means
to
righteousness
was
as
blessed
as
another
they
themselves
never
missed
a
sunday
and
as
seldom
failed
to
remark
on
the
way
back
that
it
was
all
very
interesting
but
mr
finlay
couldn
t
drive
it
home
like
the
doctor
there
were
times
sparse
and
special
occasions
when
the
doctor
himself
made
one
of
the
congregation
then
he
would
lean
back
luxuriously
in
the
corner
of
his
own
pew
his
wiry
little
form
in
the
upholstery
his
arms
folded
his
knees
crossed
his
face
all
humorous
indulgence
yes
humorous
at
the
announcement
of
the
text
a
twinkle
would
lodge
in
the
shrewd
grey
eyes
and
a
smile
but
would
settle
about
the
corners
of
the
flexible
mouth
he
knew
what
the
young
fellow
there
would
be
at
and
as
the
young
fellow
proceeded
his
points
would
be
weighed
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
doctor
s
pendent
foot
which
moved
perpetually
judiciously
while
the
smile
sometimes
deepened
sometimes
lapsed
since
there
were
moments
when
any
young
fellow
had
to
be
taken
seriously
it
was
an
attitude
which
only
the
doctor
was
privileged
to
adopt
thus
outwardly
but
in
private
it
was
imitated
all
up
and
down
the
aisles
where
responsible
heads
of
families
sat
considering
the
quality
of
the
manna
that
was
offered
them
when
it
fell
from
the
lips
of
mr
finlay
the
verdict
was
upon
the
whole
very
favourable
as
long
as
there
was
no
question
of
comparison
with
the
doctor
there
could
be
indeed
very
little
question
of
such
comparison
there
was
a
generation
between
them
and
a
school
and
to
that
you
had
to
add
every
set
and
cast
of
mind
and
body
that
can
make
men
different
dr
drummond
in
faith
and
practice
moved
with
precision
along
formal
and
implicit
lines
his
orbit
was
established
and
his
operation
within
it
as
unquestionable
as
the
simplest
exhibit
of
nature
he
took
in
a
wonderful
degree
the
stamp
of
the
teaching
of
his
adolescent
period
not
a
line
was
missing
nor
a
precept
nor
was
the
mould
defaced
by
a
single
wavering
tendency
of
later
date
religious
doctrine
was
to
him
a
thing
for
ever
accomplished
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
as
a
whole
he
taught
eternal
punishment
and
retribution
reconciling
both
with
divine
love
and
mercy
he
liked
to
defeat
the
infidel
with
the
crashing
question
who
then
was
the
architect
of
the
universe
the
celebrated
among
such
persons
he
pursued
to
their
deathbeds
voltaire
and
rousseau
owed
their
reputation
with
many
persons
in
knox
church
to
their
last
moments
and
to
dr
drummond
he
had
a
triumphant
invective
which
drew
the
mind
from
chasms
in
logic
and
a
tender
sense
of
poetic
beauty
which
drew
it
when
he
quoted
great
lines
from
everything
else
he
loved
the
euphony
of
the
old
testament
his
sonorous
delivery
would
lift
a
chapter
from
isaiah
to
the
height
of
ritual
and
every
psalm
he
read
was
a
magnificat
whether
he
would
or
no
the
warrior
in
him
was
happy
among
the
princes
of
issachar
and
the
parallels
he
would
find
for
modern
events
in
the
annals
of
judah
and
of
israel
were
astounding
yet
he
kept
a
sharp
eye
upon
the
daily
paper
and
his
reference
to
current
events
would
often
give
his
listeners
an
audacious
sense
of
which
might
have
been
easily
discounted
by
the
argument
they
illustrated
the
survivors
of
a
convulsion
of
nature
for
instance
might
have
learned
from
his
lips
the
cause
and
kind
of
their
disaster
traced
back
forcibly
to
local
acquiescence
in
iniquity
and
drawn
unflinchingly
from
the
text
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
the
militant
history
of
his
church
was
a
passion
with
him
if
ever
he
had
to
countenance
canonization
he
would
have
led
off
with
jenny
geddes
a
tremendous
presbyterian
they
called
him
in
the
town
to
hear
him
give
out
a
single
psalm
and
sing
it
with
his
people
would
convince
anybody
of
that
there
was
a
choir
of
course
but
to
the
front
pews
at
all
events
dr
drummond
s
leading
was
more
important
than
the
choir
s
it
was
a
note
of
dauntless
vigour
and
it
was
plain
by
the
regular
forward
jerk
of
his
surpliced
shoulder
that
his
foot
was
keeping
time
where
the
assemblies
of
the
just
and
congregations
are
you
could
not
help
admiring
and
you
could
not
help
respecting
you
were
compelled
by
his
natural
force
and
his
unqualified
conviction
his
tireless
energy
and
his
sterling
sort
it
is
possible
to
understand
however
that
after
sitting
for
years
under
direction
so
unfailing
and
so
uncompromising
the
congregation
of
knox
church
might
turn
with
a
moderate
curiosity
to
the
spiritual
indications
of
the
reverend
hugh
finlay
he
was
a
passionate
romantic
and
his
body
had
shot
up
into
a
fitting
temple
for
such
an
inhabitant
as
his
soul
he
was
a
great
long
fellow
with
a
shock
of
black
hair
and
deep
dreams
in
his
eyes
his
head
was
what
people
called
a
type
a
type
i
suppose
of
the
simple
motive
and
the
noble
intention
the
detached
point
of
view
and
the
somewhat
indifferent
attitude
to
material
things
as
it
may
be
humanly
featured
anywhere
his
face
bore
a
confusion
of
ideals
he
had
the
brow
of
a
covenanter
and
the
mouth
of
adonais
the
flame
of
religious
ardour
in
his
eyes
and
the
composure
of
perceived
philosophy
on
his
lips
he
was
fettered
by
an
impenetrable
shyness
it
was
in
the
pulpit
alone
that
he
could
expand
and
then
only
upon
written
lines
with
hardly
a
gesture
and
the
most
perfunctory
glances
at
conscientious
intervals
toward
his
hearers
a
poor
creature
indeed
in
this
respect
dr
drummond
thought
him
dr
drummond
who
wore
an
untrammelled
surplice
which
filled
like
an
agitated
sail
in
his
quick
tacks
from
right
to
left
the
man
loses
half
his
points
said
dr
drummond
i
doubt
whether
he
did
people
followed
so
closely
though
sandy
macquhot
was
of
the
general
opinion
when
he
said
that
it
would
do
nobody
any
harm
if
mr
finlay
would
lift
his
head
oftener
from
the
book
advena
murchison
thought
him
the
probable
antitype
of
an
oxford
don
she
had
never
seen
an
oxford
don
but
mr
finlay
wore
the
characteristics
these
schoolmen
were
dressed
in
by
novelists
and
advena
noted
with
delight
the
ingenuity
of
fate
in
casting
such
a
person
into
the
pulpit
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
a
young
country
she
had
her
perception
of
comedy
in
life
till
finlay
came
she
had
found
nothing
so
interesting
with
his
arrival
however
other
preoccupations
fell
into
their
proper
places
finlay
indeed
it
may
be
confessed
at
once
he
and
not
his
message
was
her
engrossment
from
the
beginning
the
message
she
took
with
reverent
gentleness
but
her
passionate
interest
was
for
the
nature
upon
which
it
travelled
and
never
for
the
briefest
instant
did
she
confuse
these
emotions
those
who
write
we
are
told
transcribe
themselves
in
spite
of
themselves
it
is
more
true
of
those
who
preach
for
they
are
also
candid
by
profession
and
when
they
are
not
there
is
the
eye
and
the
voice
to
help
to
betray
them
hugh
finlay
in
the
pulpit
made
himself
manifest
in
all
the
things
that
matter
to
advena
murchison
in
the
pew
and
from
the
pew
to
the
pulpit
her
love
went
back
with
certainty
clear
in
its
authority
and
worshipping
the
ground
of
its
justification
when
she
bowed
her
head
it
was
he
whom
she
heard
in
the
language
of
his
invocations
his
doctrine
rode
for
her
on
a
spirit
of
wide
and
sweet
philosophy
in
his
contemplation
of
the
deity
she
saw
the
man
he
had
those
lips
at
once
mobile
governed
and
patient
upon
which
genius
chooses
oftenest
to
rest
as
to
this
advena
s
convictions
were
so
private
as
to
be
hidden
from
herself
she
never
admitted
that
she
thought
finlay
had
it
and
in
the
supreme
difficulty
of
proving
anything
else
we
may
wisely
accept
her
view
but
he
had
something
the
subtle
celt
he
had
horizons
lifted
lines
beyond
the
common
vision
and
an
eye
rapt
and
a
heart
intrepid
and
though
for
a
long
time
he
was
unconscious
of
it
he
must
have
adventured
there
with
a
happier
confidence
because
of
her
companionship
from
the
first
advena
knew
no
faltering
or
fluttering
none
of
the
baser
nervous
betrayals
it
was
all
one
great
delight
to
her
her
discovery
and
her
knowledge
and
her
love
for
him
it
came
to
her
almost
in
a
logical
development
it
found
her
grave
calm
and
receptive
she
had
even
a
private
formula
of
gratitude
that
the
thing
which
happened
to
everybody
and
happened
to
so
many
people
irrelevantly
should
arrive
with
her
in
such
a
glorious
defensible
demonstrable
sequence
toward
him
it
gave
her
a
kind
of
glad
secret
advantage
he
was
loved
and
he
was
unaware
she
watched
his
academic
awkwardness
in
church
with
the
inward
tender
smile
of
the
eternal
habile
feminine
and
when
they
met
she
could
have
laughed
and
wept
over
his
straightened
sentences
and
his
difficult
manner
knowing
how
little
significant
they
were
with
his
eyes
upon
her
and
his
words
offered
to
her
intelligence
she
found
herself
treating
his
shy
formality
as
the
convention
it
was
a
kind
of
which
she
would
politely
and
kindly
play
up
to
until
he
should
happily
forget
it
and
they
could
enter
upon
simpler
relations
she
had
to
play
up
to
it
for
a
long
time
but
her
love
made
her
wonderfully
clever
and
patient
and
of
course
the
day
came
when
she
had
her
reward
knowing
him
as
she
did
she
remembered
the
day
and
the
difference
it
made
it
was
toward
the
end
of
an
afternoon
in
early
april
the
discoloured
snow
still
lay
huddled
in
the
bleaker
fence
corners
wide
puddles
stood
along
the
roadsides
reflecting
the
twigs
and
branches
of
the
naked
maples
last
year
s
leaves
were
thick
and
wet
underfoot
and
a
soft
damp
wind
was
blowing
advena
was
on
her
way
home
and
finlay
overtook
her
he
passed
her
at
first
with
a
hurried
silent
lifting
of
his
hat
then
perhaps
the
deserted
street
gave
a
suggestion
of
unfriendliness
to
his
act
or
some
freshness
in
her
voice
stayed
him
at
all
events
he
waited
and
joined
her
with
a
word
or
two
about
their
going
in
the
same
direction
and
they
walked
along
together
he
offered
her
his
companionship
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
the
silence
in
which
they
pursued
their
way
was
no
doubt
to
him
just
the
embarrassing
condition
he
usually
had
to
contend
with
to
her
it
seemed
pregnant
auspicious
it
drew
something
from
the
low
grey
lights
of
the
wet
spring
afternoon
and
the
unbound
wind
she
had
a
passionate
prevision
that
the
steps
they
took
together
would
lead
somehow
to
freedom
they
went
on
in
that
strange
bound
way
and
the
day
drew
away
from
them
till
they
turned
a
sudden
corner
when
it
lay
all
along
the
yellow
sky
across
the
river
behind
a
fringe
of
winter
woods
stayed
in
the
moment
of
its
retreat
on
the
edge
of
unvexed
landscape
they
stopped
involuntarily
to
look
and
she
saw
a
smile
come
up
from
some
depth
in
him
ah
well
he
said
as
if
to
himself
it
s
something
to
be
in
a
country
where
the
sun
still
goes
down
with
a
thought
of
the
i
think
i
prefer
the
sophistication
of
she
replied
i
ve
always
longed
to
see
a
sunset
in
london
with
the
fog
breaking
over
then
you
don
t
care
about
them
for
themselves
sunsets
he
asked
with
the
simplest
absence
of
mind
i
never
yet
could
see
the
sun
go
down
but
i
was
angry
in
my
heart
she
said
and
this
time
he
looked
at
her
how
does
it
go
on
he
said
oh
i
don
t
know
only
those
two
lines
stay
with
me
i
feel
it
that
way
too
it
s
the
seal
upon
an
act
of
violence
isn
t
it
a
sunset
something
taken
from
us
against
our
will
it
s
a
hateful
reminder
in
the
midst
of
our
delightful
volitions
of
how
arbitrary
every
condition
of
life
the
conditions
of
business
are
always
arbitrary
life
is
a
business
we
have
to
work
at
ourselves
till
it
is
over
so
much
cut
off
and
ended
it
is
he
said
glancing
at
the
sky
again
if
space
is
the
area
of
life
and
time
is
its
opportunity
there
goes
a
measure
of
i
wonder
said
advena
where
it
goes
into
the
void
behind
time
he
suggested
smiling
straight
at
her
into
the
texture
of
the
future
she
answered
smiling
back
we
might
bring
it
to
bear
very
intelligently
on
the
future
at
any
rate
he
returned
the
world
is
wrapped
in
destiny
and
but
revolves
to
roll
it
i
don
t
remember
that
she
said
curiously
no
you
couldn
t
he
laughed
outright
i
haven
t
thought
it
good
enough
to
and
it
isn
t
the
sort
of
thing
she
ventured
gaily
you
could
put
in
a
no
it
isn
they
came
to
a
corner
of
the
street
which
led
to
mr
finlay
s
it
stretched
narrowly
to
the
north
and
there
was
a
good
deal
more
snow
on
each
side
of
it
they
lingered
together
for
a
moment
talking
seizing
the
new
joy
in
it
which
was
simply
the
joy
of
his
sudden
liberation
with
her
consciously
pushing
away
the
moment
of
parting
and
finlay
s
eyes
rested
once
again
on
the
evening
sky
beyond
the
river
i
believe
you
are
right
and
i
am
a
moralizer
he
said
there
is
pain
over
there
one
thinks
a
sunset
beautiful
and
impressive
but
one
doesn
t
look
at
it
then
they
separated
and
he
took
the
road
to
the
north
which
was
still
snowbound
while
she
went
on
into
the
chilly
yellow
west
with
the
odd
sweet
illusion
that
a
summer
day
was
dawning
chapter
ix
the
office
of
messrs
fulke
warner
murchison
was
in
market
street
exactly
over
scott
s
drug
store
scott
with
his
globular
blue
and
red
and
green
vessels
in
the
window
and
his
fountain
inside
was
on
the
ground
floor
the
passage
leading
upstairs
separated
him
from
mickie
boots
and
shoes
and
beyond
mickie
elgin
s
leading
tobacconist
shared
his
place
of
business
with
a
barber
the
last
two
contributed
most
to
the
gaiety
of
market
street
the
barber
with
the
ribanded
pole
which
stuck
out
at
an
angle
the
tobacconist
with
a
nobly
featured
squaw
in
chocolate
effigy
who
held
her
draperies
under
her
chin
with
one
hand
and
outstretched
a
packet
of
cigars
with
the
other
the
passage
staircase
between
scott
s
and
mickie
s
had
a
hardened
look
and
bore
witness
to
the
habit
of
expectoration
ladies
going
up
to
dr
simmons
held
their
skirts
up
and
the
corners
of
their
mouths
down
dr
simmons
was
the
dentist
you
turned
to
the
right
the
passage
itself
turned
to
the
left
and
after
passing
two
doors
bearing
the
law
firm
s
designation
in
black
letters
on
ground
glass
it
conducted
you
with
abruptness
to
the
office
of
a
bicycle
agent
and
left
you
there
for
greater
emphasis
the
name
of
the
firm
of
messrs
fulke
warner
murchison
was
painted
on
the
windows
also
it
could
be
seen
from
any
part
of
the
market
square
which
lay
with
the
town
hall
in
the
middle
immediately
below
during
four
days
in
the
week
the
market
square
was
empty
odds
and
ends
of
straw
and
paper
blew
about
it
an
occasional
pedestrian
crossed
it
diagonally
for
the
short
cut
to
the
the
town
hall
rose
in
the
middle
and
defied
you
to
take
your
mind
off
the
ugliness
of
municipal
institutions
on
the
other
days
it
was
a
scene
of
activity
farmers
wagons
with
the
shafts
turned
in
were
ranged
round
three
sides
of
it
on
a
big
day
they
would
form
into
parallel
lanes
and
cut
the
square
into
sections
as
well
the
produce
of
all
fox
county
filled
the
wagons
varying
agreeably
as
the
year
went
round
bags
of
potatoes
leaned
against
the
sidewalk
apples
brimmed
in
bushel
measures
ducks
dropped
their
twisted
necks
over
the
cart
wheels
the
town
hall
in
this
play
of
colour
stood
redeemed
the
produce
was
mostly
left
to
the
women
to
sell
on
the
fourth
side
of
the
square
loads
of
hay
and
cordwood
demanded
the
master
mind
but
small
matters
of
fruit
vegetables
and
poultry
submitted
to
feminine
judgement
the
men
unhitched
and
went
away
on
their
own
business
it
was
the
wives
you
accosted
as
they
sat
in
the
middle
with
their
knees
drawn
up
and
their
skirts
tucked
close
vigilant
in
rusty
bonnets
if
you
wished
to
buy
among
them
circulated
the
housewives
of
elgin
pricing
and
comparing
and
acquiring
you
could
see
it
all
from
dr
simmons
s
window
sitting
in
his
chair
that
screwed
up
and
down
there
was
a
little
difficulty
always
about
getting
things
home
only
very
ordinary
people
carried
their
own
marketing
trifling
articles
like
eggs
or
radishes
might
be
smuggled
into
a
brown
wicker
basket
with
covers
but
it
did
not
consort
with
elegance
to
trapes
home
with
anything
that
looked
inconvenient
or
had
legs
sticking
out
of
it
so
that
arrangements
of
mutual
obligation
had
to
be
made
the
good
woman
from
whom
mrs
jones
had
bought
her
tomatoes
would
take
charge
of
the
spring
chickens
mrs
jones
had
bought
from
another
good
woman
just
as
soon
as
not
and
deliver
them
at
mrs
jones
s
residence
as
under
any
circumstances
she
was
going
round
that
it
was
a
scene
of
activity
but
not
of
excitement
or
in
any
sense
of
joy
the
matter
was
too
hard
an
importance
it
made
too
much
difference
on
both
sides
whether
potatoes
were
twelve
or
fifteen
cents
a
peck
the
dealers
were
laconic
and
the
buyers
anxious
country
neighbours
exchanged
the
time
of
day
but
under
the
pressure
of
affairs
now
and
then
a
lady
of
elgin
stopped
to
gossip
with
another
the
countrywomen
looked
on
curious
grim
and
a
little
contemptuous
of
so
much
demonstration
and
so
many
words
life
on
an
elgin
market
day
was
a
serious
presentment
even
when
the
sun
shone
and
at
times
when
it
rained
or
snowed
the
aesthetic
seemed
a
wholly
unjustifiable
point
of
view
it
was
not
misery
it
was
even
a
difficult
kind
of
prosperity
but
the
margin
was
small
and
the
struggle
plain
plain
too
it
was
that
here
was
no
enterprise
of
yesterday
no
fresh
broken
ground
of
dramatic
promise
but
a
narrow
inheritance
of
the
opportunity
to
live
which
generations
had
grasped
before
there
were
bones
in
the
village
graveyards
of
fox
county
to
father
all
these
sharp
features
elgin
market
square
indeed
was
the
biography
of
fox
county
and
in
little
the
history
of
the
whole
province
the
heart
of
it
was
there
the
enduring
heart
of
the
new
country
already
old
in
acquiescence
it
was
the
deep
root
of
the
race
in
the
land
twisted
and
unlovely
but
holding
the
promise
of
all
something
like
that
lorne
murchison
felt
about
it
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
passage
i
have
mentioned
and
looked
across
the
road
the
spectacle
never
failed
to
cheer
him
he
was
uniformly
in
gayer
spirits
better
satisfied
with
life
and
more
consciously
equal
to
what
he
had
to
do
on
days
when
the
square
was
full
than
on
days
when
it
was
empty
this
morning
he
had
an
elation
of
his
own
it
touched
everything
with
more
vivid
reality
the
familiar
picture
stirred
a
joy
in
him
in
tune
with
his
private
happiness
its
undernote
came
to
him
with
a
pang
as
keen
the
sense
of
kinship
surged
in
his
heart
these
were
his
people
this
his
lot
as
well
as
theirs
for
the
first
time
he
saw
it
in
detachment
till
now
he
had
regarded
it
with
the
friendly
eyes
of
a
participator
who
looked
no
further
today
he
did
look
further
the
whole
world
invited
his
eyes
offering
him
a
great
piece
of
luck
to
look
through
the
opportunity
was
in
his
hand
which
if
he
could
seize
and
hold
would
lift
and
carry
him
on
he
was
as
much
aware
of
its
potential
significance
as
anyone
could
be
and
what
leapt
in
his
veins
till
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
was
the
splendid
conviction
of
resource
already
in
the
door
of
the
passage
he
had
achieved
from
that
point
he
looked
at
the
scene
before
him
with
an
impulse
of
loyalty
and
devotion
a
tenderness
seized
him
for
the
farmers
of
fox
county
a
throb
of
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
they
represented
which
had
become
for
him
suddenly
moving
and
pictorial
at
that
moment
his
country
came
subjectively
into
his
possession
great
and
helpless
it
came
into
his
inheritance
as
it
comes
into
the
inheritance
of
every
man
who
can
take
it
by
deed
of
imagination
and
energy
and
love
he
held
this
microcosm
of
it
as
one
might
say
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
ardently
then
he
took
his
way
across
the
road
a
tall
thickly
built
young
fellow
detached
himself
from
a
group
smiling
broadly
at
the
sight
of
murchison
and
started
to
meet
him
hello
lorne
he
said
he
had
smiled
all
the
way
anticipating
the
encounter
he
was
obviously
in
clothes
which
he
did
not
put
on
every
day
but
the
seriousness
of
this
was
counteracted
by
his
hard
felt
hat
which
he
wore
at
an
angle
that
disregarded
convention
hello
elmore

back
that
s
about
you

t
say

well

the
young
men
had
taken
their
way
among
the
shifting
crowd
together
lorne
murchison
although
there
was
something
too
large
about
him
for
the
town
s
essential
stamp
made
by
contrast
as
he
threaded
the
desultory
groups
of
country
people
a
type
of
the
conventional
and
the
formed
his
companion
glanced
at
him
now
and
then
with
admiration
the
values
of
carriage
and
of
clothes

relative

would
have
looked
countrified
in
piccadilly
colonial
districts
are
imaginable
perhaps
not
in
this
world
where
the
frequenters
of
even
those
fashionable
thoroughfares
would
attract
glances
of
curiosity
by
their
failure
to
achieve
the
common
standard
in
such
things
lorne
murchison
to
dismiss
the
matter
was
well
up
to
the
standard
of
elgin
though
he
wore
his
straw
hat
quite
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
buried
both
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
his
eye
was
full
of
pleasant
easy
familiarity
with
the
things
he
saw
and
ready
to
see
larger
things
it
had
that
beam
of
active
inquiry
curious
but
never
amazed
that
marks
the
man
likely
to
expand
his
horizons
meanwhile
he
was
on
capital
terms
with
his
little
world
which
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
hailing
him
by
his
christian
name
even
morose
jim
webster
who
had
failed
three
times
in
groceries
said
morning
lorne
with
a
look
of
toleration
he
moved
alertly
the
poise
of
his
head
was
sanguine
the
sun
shone
on
him
the
timidest
soul
came
nearer
to
him
he
and
elmore
crow
who
walked
beside
him
had
gone
through
the
lower
forms
of
the
elgin
collegiate
institute
together
that
really
public
kind
of
school
which
has
so
much
to
do
with
reassorting
the
classes
of
a
new
country
the
collegiate
institute
took
in
raw
material
and
turned
out
teachers
more
teachers
than
anything
the
teachers
taught
chiefly
in
rural
districts
where
they
could
save
money
and
with
the
money
they
saved
changed
themselves
into
doctors
fellows
of
the
university
mining
engineers
the
collegiate
institute
was
a
potential
you
went
in
as
your
simple
opportunities
had
made
you
how
you
shaped
coming
out
depended
upon
what
was
hidden
in
the
core
of
you
you
could
not
in
any
case
be
the
same
as
your
father
before
you
education
in
a
new
country
is
too
powerful
a
stimulant
for
that
working
upon
material
too
plastic
and
too
hypothetical
it
is
not
yet
a
normal
force
with
an
operation
to
be
reckoned
on
with
confidence
it
is
indeed
the
touchstone
for
character
in
a
new
people
for
character
acquired
as
apart
from
that
inherited
it
sometimes
reveals
surprises
neither
lorne
murchison
nor
elmore
crow
illustrates
this
point
very
nearly
lorne
would
have
gone
into
the
law
in
any
case
since
his
father
was
able
to
send
him
and
elmore
would
inevitably
have
gone
back
to
the
crops
since
he
was
early
defeated
by
any
other
possibility
nevertheless
as
they
walk
together
in
my
mind
along
the
elgin
market
square
the
elgin
collegiate
institute
rises
infallibly
behind
them
a
directing
influence
and
a
responsible
parent
lorne
was
telling
his
great
news
you
don
t
say
remarked
elmore
in
response
to
it
lumbago
is
it
pa
s
subject
to
that
too
gets
an
attack
most
springs
mr
fulke
ll
have
to
lay
right
up
it
s
the
only
i
m
afraid
he
will
and
warner
never
appeared
in
court
in
his
what
d
ye
keep
warner
for
then
oh
he
does
the
conveyancing
he
s
a
good
conveyancer
but
he
isn
t
any
pleader
and
doesn
t
pretend
to
be
and
it
s
too
late
to
transfer
the
case
nobody
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
as
we
have
in
the
time
so
it
falls
on
caesar
his
ghost
how
d
ye
feel
about
it
lorne
i
d
be
scared
green
y
don
t
talk
nervous
now
i
bet
you
get
there
with
both
i
hope
to
get
there
the
young
lawyer
answered
and
as
he
spoke
a
concentration
came
into
his
face
which
drove
the
elation
and
everything
else
that
was
boyish
out
of
it
it
s
bigger
business
than
i
could
have
expected
for
another
five
years
i
m
sorry
for
the
old
man
though
he
s
nervous
if
you
like
they
can
hardly
keep
him
in
bed
isn
t
that
somebody
beckoning
to
you
elmore
looked
everywhere
except
in
the
right
direction
among
the
carts
if
you
had
been
to
the
collegiate
relatives
among
the
carts
selling
squashes
were
embarrassing
there
his
companion
indicated
it
s
mother
replied
mr
crow
with
elaborate
unconcern
but
i
don
t
suppose
she
s
in
anything
of
a
hurry
i
ll
just
go
along
with
you
far
s
the
he
kept
his
glance
carefully
from
the
spot
at
which
he
was
signalled
and
a
hint
of
copper
colour
crawled
up
the
back
of
his
neck
oh
but
she
is
come
along
elmore
i
can
go
that
it
ll
be
longer
for
not
a
lorne
cast
a
shrewd
glance
at
his
companion
and
as
we
re
passing
you
might
just
introduce
me
to
your
mother
see
she
won
t
expect
it
that
s
all
right
my
son
she
won
t
refuse
to
meet
a
friend
of
he
led
the
way
as
he
spoke
to
the
point
of
vantage
occupied
by
mrs
crow
followed
with
plain
reluctance
by
her
son
she
was
a
old
woman
with
a
knitted
shawl
pinned
tightly
across
her
chest
and
her
bonnet
in
the
course
of
commercial
activity
pushed
so
far
back
as
to
be
almost
falling
off
you
might
smarten
yourself
with
that
change
elmore
she
addressed
him
ignoring
his
companion
there
s
folks
coming
back
for
it
bill
wa
n
t
it
fifty
cents
dollar
n
a
half
that
s
a
yankee
dime
an
you
kin
march
straight
back
with
it
they
don

but
for
nine

as
you

enough
to

you
ll
get
most
for
the

at
the
barker
house
an
bring
me
back
another
quarter
better
go
an
get
your
victuals
now
it
s
gone
twelve
while
they
re
elmore
took
his
instructions
without
visible
demur
and
then
as
lorne
had
not
seen
fit
to
detach
himself
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
as
he
performed
it
he
drew
one
foot
back
and
bowed
himself
which
seemed
obscurely
to
facilitate
it
the
suspicion
faded
out
of
mrs
crow
s
tired
old
sharp
eyes
under
the
formula
and
she
said
she
was
pleased
to
make
our
friend
s
acquaintance
mr
murchison
s
changed
some
since
the
old
days
at
the
collegiate
elmore
explained
but
he
ain
t
any
different
under
his
coat
he
s
practisin
the
lawyers
mrs
crow
observed
are
folks
i
like
to
keep
away
quite
right
too
responded
lorne
unabashed
and
so
you
ve
got
my
friend
here
back
on
the
farm
mrs
crow
well
yes
he
s
back
on
the
farm
an
when
he
s
wore
out
his
winnipeg
clothes
and
his
big
ideas
we
re
lookin
to
make
him
some
mrs
crow
s
intention
though
barbed
was
humorous
and
her
son
grinned
broadly
there
s
more
money
in
the
law
he
remarked
once
you
get
a
start
here
s
mr
murchison
goin
to
run
the
ormiston
case
his
old
man
s
down
sick
an
i
guess
it
depends
on
lorne
now
whether
ormiston
gets
off
or
goes
to
mrs
crow
s
face
tied
itself
up
into
criticism
as
she
looked
our
young
man
up
and
down
depends
upon
you
does
it
she
commented
well
all
i
ve
got
to
say
is
it
s
a
mighty
young
dependence
coming
on
next
week
ain
t
it
you
won
t
be
much
older
by
then
yes
m
she
turned
to
business
i
don
t
say
but
what
it
s
high
for
rhubarb
but
there
ain
t
another
bunch
in
the
market
and
won
t
be
for
a
week
under
cover
of
this
discussion
lorne
bade
the
crows
good
morning
retreating
in
the
rear
of
the
lady
who
found
the
rhubarb
high
mrs
crow

drop
of
acid
combined
with
his
saving
sense
of
the
humour
of
it
to
adjust
all
his
courage
and
his
confidence
and
with
a
braver
face
than
ever
he
involuntarily
hastened
his
steps
to
keep
pace
with
his
happy
chance
chapter
x
in
the
wide
stretches
of
a
new
country
there
is
nothing
to
bound
a
local
excitement
or
to
impede
its
transmission
at
full
value
elgin
was
a
manufacturing
town
in
southern
ontario
but
they
would
have
known
every
development
of
the
federal
bank
case
at
the
north
pole
if
there
had
been
anybody
there
to
learn
in
halifax
they
did
know
it
and
in
vancouver
while
every
hundred
miles
nearer
it
warmed
as
a
topic
in
proportion
in
montreal
the
papers
gave
it
headlines
from
toronto
they
sent
special
reporters
of
course
it
was
most
of
all
the
opportunity
of
mr
horace
williams
of
the
elgin
express
and
of
rawlins
who
held
all
the
cards
in
their
hands
and
played
them
it
must
be
said
admirably
reducing
the
mercury
to
all
sorts
of
futile
expedients
to
score
which
the
express
would
invariably
explode
with
a
guffaw
of
contradiction
the
following
day
it
was
to
the
express
that
the
toronto
reporters
came
for
details
and
local
colour
and
mr
williams
gave
them
just
as
much
as
he
thought
they
ought
to
have
and
no
more
it
was
the
express
that
managed
while
elaborately
abstaining
from
improper
comment
upon
a
matter
sub
judice
to
feed
and
support
the
general
conviction
of
young
ormiston
s
innocence
and
thereby
win
for
itself
though
a
grit
paper
wide
reading
in
that
hotbed
of
toryism
moneida
reservation
while
the
conservative
mercury
with
its
reckless
sympathy
for
an
old
party
name
made
itself
criminally
liable
by
reviewing
cases
of
hard
dealing
by
the
bank
among
the
farmers
and
only
escaped
prosecution
by
the
amplest
retraction
and
the
most
contrite
apology
as
mr
williams
remarked
there
was
no
use
in
dwelling
on
the
unpopularity
of
the
bank
that
didn
t
need
pointing
out
folks
down
moneida
way
could
put
any
newspaper
wise
on
the
number
of
mortgages
foreclosed
and
the
rate
for
secondary
loans
exacted
by
the
bank
in
those
parts
that
consideration
no
doubt
human
nature
being
what
it
is
contributed
the
active
principle
to
the
feeling
so
widely
aroused
by
the
case
we
are
not
very
readily
the
prey
to
emotions
of
faith
in
our
fellows
especially
perhaps
if
we
live
under
conditions
somewhat
hard
and
narrow
the
greater
animosity
behind
is
at
all
events
valuable
to
give
force
and
relief
and
staying
power
to
a
sentiment
of
generous
conviction
but
however
we
may
depreciate
its
origin
the
conviction
was
there
widespread
in
the
townships
young
ormiston
would
get
clear
the
case
for
the
defence
might
be
heard
over
every
bushel
of
oats
in
elgin
in
elgin
itself
opinion
was
more
reserved
there
was
a
general
view
that
these
bank
clerks
were
fast
fellows
and
a
tendency
to
contrast
the
habits
and
the
pay
of
such
dashing
young
men
an
exercise
which
ended
in
a
not
unnatural
query
as
to
the
irritating
caste
feeling
maintained
among
them
young
ormiston
perhaps
gave
himself
as
few
airs
as
any
he
was
generally
conceded
indeed
by
the
judging
sex
to
be
nice
to
everybody
but
was
not
that
exactly
the
nature
for
which
temptations
were
most
easily
spread
the
town
moreover
had
a
sapience
of
its
own
was
it
likely
that
the
bank
would
bring
a
case
so
publicly
involving
its
character
and
management
without
knowing
pretty
well
what
it
was
about
the
town
would
not
be
committed
beyond
the
circle
of
young
ormiston
s
intimate
friends
which
was
naturally
small
if
you
compared
it
with
the
public
the
town
wasn
t
going
to
be
surprised
at
anything
that
might
be
proved
on
the
other
hand
the
town
was
much
more
vividly
touched
than
the
country
by
the
accident
which
had
made
lorne
murchison
practically
sole
counsel
for
the
defence
announced
as
it
was
by
the
express
with
every
appreciation
of
its
dramatic
value
among
what
the
express
called
the
farming
community
this
in
so
far
as
it
had
penetrated
was
regarded
as
a
simple
misfortune
a
dull
blow
to
expectancy
which
expectancy
had
some
work
to
survive
elgin
with
its
finer
palate
for
sensation
saw
in
it
heightened
chances
both
for
lorne
and
for
the
case
and
if
any
ratepayer
within
its
limits
had
remained
indifferent
to
the
suit
the
fact
that
one
side
of
it
had
been
confided
to
so
young
and
so
smart
a
fellow
townsman
would
have
been
bound
to
draw
him
into
the
circle
of
speculation
youth
in
a
young
country
is
a
symbol
wearing
all
its
value
it
stands
not
only
for
what
it
is
the
trick
of
augury
invests
it
at
a
glance
with
the
sum
of
its
possibilities
the
augurs
all
sincere
confident
and
exulting
they
have
been
justified
so
often
they
know
in
their
wide
fair
fields
of
opportunity
just
what
qualities
will
produce
what
results
there
is
thus
a
complacence
among
adolescent
peoples
which
is
vaguely
irritating
to
their
elders
but
the
greybeards
need
not
be
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
pathetically
in
the
history
of
the
race
sanguine
persons
in
elgin
were
freely
disposed
to
bet
on
lorne
murchison
and
there
were
none
so
despondent
as
to
take
the
view
that
he
would
not
come
out
of
it
somehow
with
an
added
personal
significance
to
make
a
spoon
is
a
laudable
achievement
but
it
may
be
no
mean
business
to
spoil
a
horn
as
the
express
put
it
there
was
as
little
standing
room
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
courthouse
the
first
day
of
the
spring
assizes
as
there
was
for
horses
in
the
court
house
square
the
county
crown
attorney
was
unusually
oddly
reinforced
by
cruickshank
of
toronto
the
great
cruickshank
probably
the
most
distinguished
criminal
lawyer
in
the
province
there
were
those
who
considered
that
cruickshank
should
not
have
been
brought
down
that
it
argued
undue
influence
on
the
part
of
the
bank
and
his
retainer
was
a
fierce
fan
to
the
feeling
in
moneida
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
appearance
added
all
that
was
possible
to
the
universal
interest
in
the
case
henry
cruickshank
was
an
able
man
and
what
was
rarer
a
fastidious
politician
he
had
held
office
in
the
dominion
cabinet
and
had
resigned
it
because
of
a
difference
with
his
colleagues
in
the
application
of
a
principle
they
called
him
after
a
british
politician
of
lofty
but
abortive
views
the
canadian
renfaire
he
had
that
independence
of
personality
that
intellectual
candour
and
that
touch
of
magnetism
which
combine
to
make
a
man
interesting
in
his
public
relations
cruickshank
s
name
alone
would
have
filled
the
courthouse
and
people
would
have
gone
away
quoting
him
from
the
first
word
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
there
was
that
in
the
leading
counsel
s
manner
a
gravity
a
kindness
an
inclination
to
neglect
the
commoner
methods
of
scoring
that
suggested
with
the
sudden
chill
of
unexpectedly
bad
news
a
foregone
conclusion
the
reality
of
his
feeling
reference
to
the
painful
position
of
the
defendant
s
father
the
sincerity
of
his
regret
on
behalf
of
the
bank
for
the
deplorable
exigency
under
which
proceedings
had
been
instituted
spread
a
kind
of
blankness
through
the
court
men
frowned
thoughtfully
and
one
or
two
ladies
shed
furtive
tears
even
the
counsel
for
the
defence
it
was
afterward
remembered
looked
grave
sympathetic
and
concerned
in
response
to
the
brief
but
significant
and
moving
sentences
with
which
his
eminent
opponent
opened
the
case
it
is
not
my
duty
to
report
the
trial
for
any
newspaper
i
will
therefore
spare
myself
more
than
the
most
general
references
but
the
facts
undoubtedly
were
that
a
safe
in
the
strong
room
of
the
bank
had
been
opened
between
certain
hours
on
a
certain
night
and
its
contents
abstracted
that
young
ormiston
cashier
of
the
bank
was
sleeping
or
supposed
to
be
sleeping
upon
the
premises
at
this
time
during
the
illness
of
the
junior
whose
usual
duty
it
was
and
that
the
crown
was
in
possession
of
certain
evidence
which
would
be
brought
forward
to
prove
collusion
with
the
burglary
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
collusion
to
cover
deficits
for
which
he
could
be
held
responsible
in
a
strain
almost
apologetic
mr
cruickshank
explained
to
the
jury
the
circumstances
which
led
the
directors
to
the
suspicion
which
they
now
believed
only
too
regrettably
well
founded
these
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
young
man
was
known
to
be
living
beyond
his
means
and
so
to
be
constantly
visited
by
the
temptation
to
such
a
crime
the
special
facilities
which
he
controlled
for
its
commission
and
in
particular
the
ease
and
confidence
with
which
the
actual
operation
had
been
carried
out
arguing
no
fear
of
detection
on
the
part
of
the
burglars
no
danger
of
interference
from
one
who
should
have
stood
ready
to
defend
with
his
life
the
property
in
his
charge
but
who
would
shortly
be
seen
to
have
been
toward
it
first
a
plunderer
in
his
own
person
and
afterward
the
accomplice
of
plunderers
to
conceal
his
guilt
examination
showed
the
safe
to
have
been
opened
with
the
dexterity
that
demands
both
time
and
coolness
and
the
ash
from
a
pipe
knocked
out
against
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
passage
offered
ironical
testimony
to
the
comfort
in
which
the
business
had
been
done
the
lawyer
gave
these
considerations
their
full
weight
and
it
was
in
dramatic
contrast
with
the
last
of
them
that
he
produced
the
first
significant
fragment
of
evidence
against
ormiston
there
had
been
after
all
some
hurry
of
departure
it
was
shown
by
a
sheet
of
paper
bearing
the
mark
of
a
dirty
thumb
and
a
hasty
bearing
also
the
combination
formula
for
opening
the
safe
the
public
was
familiar
with
that
piece
of
evidence
it
had
gone
through
every
kind
of
mill
of
opinion
it
made
no
special
sensation
the
evidence
of
the
caretaker
who
found
the
formula
and
of
the
witnesses
who
established
it
to
be
in
young
ormiston
s
handwriting
produced
little
interest
mr
cruickshank
in
elaborating
his
theory
as
to
why
with
the
formula
in
their
hands
the
depredators
still
found
it
necessary
to
pick
the
lock
offered
nothing
to
speculations
already
current
the
duplicate
key
with
which
they
had
doubtless
been
enabled
to
supply
themselves
was
a
clumsy
copy
and
had
failed
them
that
conclusion
had
been
drawn
commonly
enough
the
next
scrap
of
paper
produced
by
the
prosecution
was
another
matter
it
was
the
mere
torn
end
of
a
greasy
sheet
upon
it
was
written
not
less
than
net
and
it
had
been
found
in
the
turning
out
of
ormiston
s
it
might
have
been
anything
a
number
of
people
pursed
their
lips
contemptuously
or
it
might
have
been
without
doubt
the
fragment
of
a
disreputable
transaction
that
the
prosecuting
counsel
endeavoured
to
show
it
here
no
doubt
was
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
the
prosecution
was
understood
to
have
up
its
sleeve
and
that
portion
of
the
prosecuting
counsel
s
garment
was
watched
with
feverish
interest
for
further
disclosures
they
came
rapidly
enough
but
we
must
hurry
them
even
more
the
name
of
miss
florence
belton
when
it
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
evidence
riveted
every
eye
and
ear
miss
belton
was
one
of
those
ambiguous
ladies
who
sometimes
drift
out
from
the
metropolitan
vortex
and
circle
restfully
in
backwaters
for
varying
periods
appearing
and
disappearing
irrelevantly
they
dress
beautifully
they
are
known
to
paint
and
thought
to
dye
their
hair
they
establish
no
relations
being
much
too
preoccupied
making
exceptions
only
as
a
rule
in
favour
of
one
or
two
young
men
to
whom
they
extend
amenities
based
it
is
the
common
talk
upon
late
hours
and
they
seem
superior
to
the
little
prevailing
conventions
they
excite
an
unlawful
interest
though
nobody
knows
them
black
nobody
imagines
them
white
and
when
they
appear
upon
main
street
in
search
of
shoelaces
or
elastic
heads
are
turned
and
nods
possibly
nudges
exchanged
miss
belton
had
come
from
new
york
to
the
barker
house
elgin
and
young
ormiston
s
intimacy
with
her
was
one
of
the
things
that
counted
against
him
in
the
general
view
it
was
to
so
count
more
seriously
in
the
particular
instance
witnesses
were
called
to
prove
that
he
had
spent
the
evening
of
the
burglary
with
miss
belton
at
her
hotel
that
he
had
remained
with
her
until
one
o
clock
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
his
evenings
with
miss
belton
rawlins
of
the
express
did
not
overdo
the
sensation
which
was
caused
in
the
courtroom
when
the
name
of
this
lady
herself
was
called
to
summon
her
to
the
witness
box
it
was
indeed
the
despair
of
his
whole
career
he
thought
despondingly
ever
after
of
the
thrill
to
which
he
himself
was
not
superior
and
which
if
he
had
only
been
able
to
handle
it
adequately
might
have
led
him
straight
up
the
ladder
to
a
night
editorship
miss
belton
appeared
from
some
unsuspected
seat
near
the
door
throwing
back
a
heavy
veil
and
walking
as
austerely
as
she
could
considering
the
colour
of
her
hair
she
took
her
place
without
emotion
and
there
she
corroborated
the
evidence
of
the
servants
of
the
hotel
to
the
grave
questions
of
the
prosecution
she
fluently
replied
that
the
distraction
of
these
evenings
had
been
cards
cards
played
certainly
for
money
and
that
she
certainly
had
won
very
considerable
sums
from
the
defendant
from
time
to
time
in
elgin
the
very
mention
of
cards
played
for
money
will
cause
a
hush
of
something
deeper
than
disapproval
there
was
silence
in
the
court
at
this
in
producing
several
banknotes
for
miss
belton
s
identification
mr
cruickshank
seemed
to
profit
by
the
silence
miss
belton
identified
them
without
hesitation
as
she
might
easily
since
they
had
been
traced
to
her
possession
asked
to
account
for
them
she
stated
without
winking
that
they
had
been
paid
to
her
by
mr
walter
ormiston
at
various
times
during
the
fortnight
preceding
the
burglary
in
satisfaction
of
debts
at
cards
she
miss
belton
had
left
elgin
for
chicago
the
day
after
the
burglary
mr
ormiston
knew
that
she
was
going
he
had
paid
her
the
four
notes
actually
traced
the
night
before
she
left
and
said
you
won
t
need
to
break
these
here
will
you
he
seemed
anxious
that
she
should
not
but
it
was
the
merest
accident
that
she
hadn
t
in
all
she
had
received
from
mr
ormiston
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
no
she
had
no
suspicion
that
the
young
man
might
not
be
in
a
position
to
make
such
payments
she
understood
that
mr
ormiston
s
family
was
wealthy
and
never
thought
twice
about
it
she
spoke
with
a
hard
dignity
the
lady
and
a
great
effect
of
doing
business
a
kind
of
assertion
of
the
legitimate
the
farmers
of
fox
county
told
each
other
in
chapfallen
appreciation
that
she
was
about
as
as
they

lawyer
cruickshank
as
they
called
him
brought
forth
from
her
detail
after
detail
and
every
detail
fitted
damningly
with
the
last
the
effect
upon
young
ormiston
was
so
painful
that
many
looked
another
way
his
jaw
was
set
and
his
features
contorted
to
hold
himself
from
the
disgrace
of
tears
he
was
generally
acknowledged
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
unexpected
demonstration
of
his
guilt
but
distress
was
so
plain
in
him
that
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
place
that
was
not
sorry
for
him
in
one
or
two
resolute
faces
hope
still
glimmered
but
it
hardly
survived
the
of
the
crown
s
chief
witness
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
which
as
far
as
it
went
had
a
perfunctory
air
and
contributed
little
to
the
evidence
before
the
court
it
did
not
go
all
the
way
however
the
case
having
opened
late
the
defence
was
reserved
till
the
following
day
when
proceedings
would
be
resumed
with
the
further
of
miss
belton
as
the
defendant
s
counsel
went
down
the
courthouse
steps
rawlins
came
up
to
him
to
take
note
of
his
demeanour
and
anything
else
that
might
be
going

certainly
for
his
constructive
view
of
his
client
s
situation
the
view
which
came
to
him
and
stayed
with
him
like
a
chapter
in
a
novel
from
the
hour
in
which
ormiston
had
reluctantly
accounted
for
himself
upon
the
night
of
the
burglary
it
was

brilliant
view
that
perceived

was
charged
with
furthering

justification

whatever

there
young
ormiston
s
commercial
probity
is
really
no
special
concern
of
ours
the
thing
which
does
matter
and
considerably
is
the
special
quality
which
lorne
murchison
brought
to
the
task
of
its
vindication
the
quality
that
made
new
and
striking
appeal
through
every
channel
of
the
great
occasion
to
those
who
heard
him
it
was
that
which
reinforced
and
comforted
every
friend
ormiston
had
in
the
courtroom
before
lorne
proceeded
either
to
deal
with
the
evidence
of
the
other
side
or
to
produce
any
jot
or
tittle
of
his
own
and
it
was
that
which
affected
his
distinguished
opponent
to
the
special
interest
which
afterward
showed
itself
so
pleasantly
superior
to
the
sting
of
defeat
the
fact
that
the
defence
was
quite
as
extraordinarily
indebted
to
circumstantial
evidence
as
the
prosecution
in
no
way
detracted
from
the
character
of
lorne
s
personal
triumph
rather
indeed
in
the
popular
view
and
rawlins
s
enhanced
it
there
was
in
it
the
primitive
joy
of
seeing
a
ruffian
knocked
down
with
his
own
illegitimate
weapons
from
the
moment
the
dropped
formula
was
proved
to
be
an
old
superseded
one
and
unexpected
indication
was
produced
that
ormiston
s
room
as
well
as
the
bank
vault
had
been
entered
the
night
of
the
robbery
to
the
more
glorious
excitement
of
establishing
miss
belton
s
connection
not
to
be
quoted
with
a
cracksman
at
that
moment
being
diligently
inquired
for
by
the
new
york
police
with
reference
to
a
dramatically
bigger
matter
you
saw
the
plot
at
once
as
he
constructed
it
the

ash
became
explicable
in
the
seduction
of
miss
belton
s
charms
the
cunning
net
unwove
itself
delicately
and
deliberately
to
tangle
round
the
lady
there
was
in
it
that
superiority
in
the
art
of
legerdemain
of
mere
calm
astonishing
manipulation
so
applauded
in
regions
where
romance
has
not
yet
been
quite
trampled
down
by
reason
lorne
scored
he
scored
in
face
of
probability
expectation
fact
it
was
the
very
climax
and
coruscation
of
score
he
scored
not
only
by
the
cards
he
held
but
by
the
beautiful
way
he
played
them
if
one
may
say
so
his
nature
came
into
this
his
gravity
and
gentleness
his
sympathy
his
young
angry
irony
to
mention
just
one
thing
there
was
the
way
he
held
miss
belton
up
after
the
exposure
of
her
arts
as
the
lady
for
whom
his
client
had
so
chivalric
a
regard
that
he
had
for
some
time
refused
to
state
his
whereabouts
at
the
hour
the
bank
was
entered
in
the
fear
of
compromising
her
for
this
no
doubt
his
client
could
have
strangled
him
but
it
operated
of
course
to
raise
the
poor
fellow
in
the
estimation
of
every
body
with
the
possible
exception
of
his
employers
when
after
the
unmistakable
the
foreman
returned
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
people
noticed
that
the
young
man
walked
out
of
court
behind
his
father
with
as
drooping
a
head
as
if
he
had
gone
under
sentence
so
much
so
that
by
common
consent
he
was
allowed
to
slip
quietly
away
miss
belton
departed
followed
by
the
detective
whose
services
were
promptly
transferred
to
the
prosecution
and
by
a
proportion
of
those
who
scented
further
entertainment
in
her
perfumed
perjured
wake
but
the
majority
hung
back
leaving
their
places
slowly
it
was
lorne
the
crowd
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
to
say
just
a
word
of
congratulation
to
lorne
s
triumph
that
they
desired
to
enhance
by
a
hearty
sentence
or
at
least
an
admiring
glance
walter

most
genial

mr

in

pride

now
i

tell
you
another
thing
today

will
do
more
for
you
than
it
has
for

mark
my
words
they
were
all
of
that
opinion
all
the
fine
foretellers
of
the
profit
lorne
should
draw
from
his
spirited
and
conspicuous
success
they
stood
about
in
knots
discussing
it
to
some
extent
it
eclipsed
the
main
interest
and
issue
of
the
day
at
that
moment
driving
out
free
and
disconsolate
between
the
snake
fences
of
the
south
riding
to
moneida
reservation
the
quick
and
friendly
sense
of
opportunity
was
abroad
on
lorne
murchison
s
behalf
friends
and
neighbours
and
dr
drummond
and
people
who
hardly
knew
the
fellow
exchanged
wise
words
about
what
his
chance
would
do
for
him
what
it
would
immediately
do
was
present
to
nobody
so
clearly
however
as
to
mr
henry
cruickshank
who
decided
that
he
would
after
all
accept
dr
drummond
s
invitation
to
spend
the
night
with
him
and
find
out
the
little
he
didn
t
know
already
about
this
young
man
that
evening
the
murchisons
doorbell
rang
twice
the
first
time
it
was
to
admit
the
rev
hugh
finlay
who
had
come
to
return
sordello
which
he
had
borrowed
from
advena
and
to
find
out
whether
she
thought
with
him
about
the
interpretation
of
certain
passages
and
if
not
there
was
always
the
possibility
wherein
their
divergence
lay
the
second
time
the
door
opened
to
dr
drummond
and
mr
cruickshank
and
the
electric
light
had
to
be
turned
on
in
the
since
the
library
was
already
occupied
by
mr
finlay
and
advena
mr
and
mrs
murchison
never
having
got
over
their
early
habit
of
sitting
in
the
after
tea
even
then
mrs
murchison
had
to
put
away
her
workbasket
and
john
murchison
to
knock
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
looking
at
one
another
with
surprised
inquiry
when
eliza
informed
them
of
their
visitors
luckily
mr
lorne
was
also
in
and
eliza
was
sent
to
tell
him
and
mr
lorne
came
down
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
to
join
the
party
in
the
which
was
presently
supplied
by
eliza
with
a
dignified
service
of
cake
and
wine
the
hall
divided
that
room
from
the
library
and
both
doors
were
shut
we
can
not
hesitate
about
which
to
open
we
have
only
indeed
to
follow
the
recognized
tradition
of
elgin
which
would
never
have
entered
the
library
no
vivid
conclusion
should
be
drawn
no
serious
situation
may
even
be
indicated
it
would
simply
have
been
considered
in
elgin
stupid
to
go
into
the
library
it
isn
t
a
case
for
the
high
commissioner
for
canada
mr
cruickshank
was
saying
it
s
a
case
for
direct
representation
of
the
interests
concerned
and
their
view
of
the
effect
upon
trade
that
s
the
only
voice
to
speak
with
if
you
want
to
get
anything
done
conviction
carries
conviction
the
high
commissioner
is
a
very
useful
fellow
to
live
in
london
and
look
after
the
ornamental
the
sentimental
and
immigration
nobody
could
do
it
better
than
selkirk
and
in
england
of
course
they
like
that
kind
of
agency
it
s
the
good
old
dignified
way
but
it
won
t
do
for
everything
you
don
t
find
our
friend
morgan
operating
through
the
american
equivalent
of
a
high
no
you
don
t
said
john
murchison
he
goes
over
there
as
a
principal
and
the
british
government
if
he
wants
to
deal
with
it
is
only
another
principal
that
s
the
way
our
deputation
will
go
we
re
practically
all
shippers
though
of
course
the
matter
of
tenders
will
come
later
there
is
big
business
for
them
here
national
business
and
we
propose
to
show
it
the
subsidy
we
want
will
come
back
to
the
country
four
times
over
in
two
years
freights
from
boston
alone
it
s
the
patriotic
imperial
argument
you
ll
have
to
press
i
doubt
said
john
murchison
they
re
not
business
people
over
there
the
men
in
office
are
not
how
should
they
be
the
system
draws
them
from
the
wrong
class
they
re
gentlemen
noblemen
maybe
first
and
they
ve
no
practical
education
there
s
only
one
way
of
getting
it
and
that
s
to
make
your
own
living
how
many
of
them
have
ever
made
tuppence
there
s
where
the
americans
beat
them
so
badly
they
ve
got
the
sixth
sense
the
business
sense
no
you
ll
not
find
them
responding
greatly
to
what
there
is
in
it
for
trade
they
d
like
to
well
enough
but
they
just
won
t
see
it
and
by
george
what
a
fine
suspicion
they
ll
have
of
ye
as
to
freights
from
boston
he
continued
as
they
all
laughed
i
m
of
opinion
you
d
better
not
mention
them
what
steal
the
trade
of
a
friendly
power
tut
tut
it
was
a
long
speech
for
john
murchison
but
they
were
all
excited
to
a
pitch
beyond
the
usual
henry
cruickshank
had
brought
with
him
an
event
of
extraordinary
importance
it
seemed
to
sit
there
with
him
significant
and
propitious
in
the
middle
of
the
sofa
they
all
looked
at
it
in
the
pauses
dr
drummond
lost
in
an
armchair
alternately
contemplated
it
and
remembered
to
assert
himself
part
of
it
as
head
of
a
deputation
from
the
united
chambers
of
commerce
of
canada
shortly
to
wait
on
the
british
government
to
press
for
the
encouragement
of
improved
communications
within
the
empire
cruickshank
had
been
asked
to
select
a
secretary
the
appointment
in
view
of
the
desirability
for
political
reasons
of
giving
the
widest
publicity
to
the
hopes
and
motives
of
the
deputation
was
an
important
one
the
action
of
the
canadian
government
in
extending
conditional
promises
of
support
had
to
be
justified
to
the
canadian
taxpayer
and
that
shy
and
weary
person
whose
shoulders
uphold
the
greatness
of
britain
had
also
to
receive
such
conciliation
and
reassurance
as
it
was
possible
to
administer
to
him
by
way
of
nerving
the
administrative
arm
over
there
to
an
act
of
enterprise
mr
cruickshank
had
had
two
or
three
young
fellows
mostly
newspaper
men
in
his
mind
s
eye
but
when
lorne
came
into
his
literal
range
of
vision
the
others
had
promptly
been
retired
in
our
friend
s
favour
young
mr
murchison
he
had
concluded
was
the
man
they
wanted
and
if
his
office
could
spare
him
it
would
probably
do
young
mr
murchison
no
harm
in
any
sort
of
way
to
accompany
the
deputation
to
london
and
throw
himself
into
the
matter
the
deputation
had
at
heart
but
it
s
the
empire
said
lorne
with
a
sort
of
shy
fire
when
mr
cruickshank
enunciated
this
we
need
not
perhaps
dwell
upon
the
significance
of
his
agreement
it
was
then
not
long
since
the
maple
leaf
had
been
stained
brighter
than
ever
not
without
honour
to
maintain
the
word
that
fell
from
him
the
three
older
men
looked
at
him
kindly
john
murchison
rubbing
his
chin
as
he
considered
the
situation
slightly
shook
his
head
one
took
it
that
in
his
view
the
empire
was
not
so
readily
envisaged
that
has
a
strong
bearing
mr
cruickshank
assented
it
s
the
whole
case
it
seems
to
me
repeated
young
murchison
it
should
help
to
knit
us
up
said
dr
drummond
i
ll
put
my
name
down
on
the
first
passenger
list
if
knox
church
will
let
me
off
see
that
you
have
special
rates
he
added
with
a
twinkle
for
ministers
and
and
only
ten
days
to
get
him
ready
in
said
mrs
murchison
it
will
take
some
seeing
to
i
assure
you
and
i
don
t
know
how
it
s
to
be
done
in
the
time
for
once
lorne
i
ll
have
to
order
you
shirts
and
you
ll
just
have
to
put
up
with
it
nothing
else
could
possibly
get
back
from
the
i
ll
put
up
with
it
they
went
into
other
details
of
lorne
s
equipment
while
mrs
murchison
s
eye
still
wandered
over
the
necessities
of
his
wardrobe
they
arranged
the
date
on
which
he
was
to
meet
the
members
of
the
deputation
in
montreal
and
mr
cruickshank
promised
to
send
him
all
available
documents
and
such
presentation
of
the
project
as
had
been
made
in
the
newspapers
you
shall
be
put
in
immediate
possession
of
the
bones
of
the
thing
he
said
but
what
really
matters
he
added
pleasantly
i
think
you
ve
got
it
took
of
course
some
discussion
and
it
was
quite
ten
o
clock
before
everything
was
gone
into
and
the
prospect
was
clear
to
them
all
as
they
emerged
into
the
hall
together
the
door
of
the
room
opposite
also
opened
and
the
rev
hugh
finlay
found
himself
added
to
their
group
they
all
made
the
best
of
the
unexpected
encounter
it
was
rather
an
elaborate
best
very
polite
and
entirely
grave
except
in
the
instance
of
dr
drummond
who
met
his
subaltern
with
a
smile
in
which
cordiality
struggled
in
vain
to
overcome
the
delighted
humour
chapter
xii
it
was
the
talk
of
the
town
the
pride
of
the
lorne
murchison
s
having
been
selected
to
accompany
what
was
known
as
the
cruickshank
deputation
to
england
the
general
spirit
of
congratulation
was
corrected
by
a
tendency
to
assert
it
another
proof
of
sagacity
on
the
chairman
s
part
elgin
wouldn
t
be
too
flattered
lawyer
cruickshank
couldn
t
have
done
better
you
may
be
sure
the
express
was
well
ahead
with
it
honour
to
our
young
fellow
townsman
a
compliment
and
rawlins
was
round
promptly
next
morning
to
glean
further
particulars
he
found
only
mrs
murchison
on
a
stepladder
tying
up
the
clematis
that
climbed
about
the
verandah
and
she
told
him
a
little
about
clematis
and
a
good
deal
about
the
inconvenience
of
having
to
abandon
superintending
the
spring
cleaning
in
order
to
get
lorne
ready
to
go
to
the
old
country
at
such
short
notice
but
nothing
he
could
put
in
the
paper
lorne
sought
at
the
office
was
hardly
more
communicative
mr
williams
himself
dropped
in
there
he
said
the
express
would
now
have
a
personal
interest
in
the
object
of
the
deputation
and
proposed
to
strike
out
a
broad
line
a
broader
line
than
ever
we
ve
got
into
the
way
of
taking
it
for
granted
said
mr
williams
that
the
subsidy
idea
is
a
kind
of
mediaeval
idea
raise
a
big
enough
shout
and
you
get
things
taken
for
granted
in
economics
for
a
long
while
conditions
keep
changing
right
along
all
the
time
and
presently
you
ve
got
to
reconsider
there
ain
t
any
sort
of
ultimate
truth
in
the
finest
economic
position
my
son
not
any
at
we
ll
subsidize
over
here
right
enough
said
lorne
that
s
the
idea
that
s
the
prevailing
idea
just
now
but
lots
of
people
think
different
more
than
you
d
imagine
i
was
talking
to
old
man
milburn
just
now
he
s
dead
against
it
government
has
no
business
he
said
to
apply
the
taxes
in
the
interests
of
any
company
it
oughtn
t
to
know
how
to
spell
if
the
trade
was
there
it
would
get
itself
carried
he
well
that
surprises
me
said
lorne
surprised
me
too
but
i
was
on
the
spot
with
him
just
thought
of
it
in
time
well
now
mr
milburn
i
said
you
ve
changed
your
mind
thought
that
was
a
thing
you
conservatives
never
did
i
said
we
don
t
i
haven
t
he
said
what
d
ye
mean
years
ago
i
said
when
you
were
considering
whether
you
d
start
the
milburn
boiler
works
here
or
in
hamilton
hamilton
offered
you
a
free
site
and
elgin
offered
you
a
free
site
and
a
dam
for
your
water
power
you
took
the
biggest
subsidy
an
came
here
i
lorne
laughed
what
did
he
say
to
that
hadn
t
a
word
i
guess
it
s
up
to
me
he
said
then
he
turned
round
and
came
back
hold
on
williams
he
said
you
know
so
much
already
about
my
boiler
works
it
wouldn
t
be
much
trouble
for
you
to
write
out
an
account
of
them
from
the
beginning
would
it
working
in
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
of
the
town
s
progress
you
know
and
all
that
come
round
to
the
office
tomorrow
and
i
ll
give
you
some
and
he
fixed
up
a
ad
right
away
he
was
afraid
i
d
round
on
him
i
suppose
if
i
caught
him
saying
anything
more
about
the
immorality
of
he
won
t
say
anything
probably
not
milburn
hasn
t
got
much
of
a
political
conscience
but
he
s
got
a
sense
of
what
s
silly
well
now
i
expect
you
want
all
the
time
there
mr
williams
removed
himself
from
the
edge
of
the
table
which
was
strewn
with
maps
and
bluebooks
printed
official
and
typewritten
papers
give
em
a
notion
of
those
assiniboian
wheat
acres
my
boy
and
the
ranch
country
we
ve
got
tell
em
about
the
future
of
quick
passage
and
cold
storage
get
em
a
little
ashamed
to
have
made
so
many
fortunes
for
yankee
beef
combines
persuade
em
the
cheapest
market
has
a
funny
way
of
getting
the
dearest
price
in
the
end
give
it
em
lorne
hot
and
cold
and
fricasseed
the
express
will
back
you
he
slapped
his
young
friend
s
shoulder
who
seemed
occupied
with
matters
that
prevented
his
at
once
feeling
the
value
of
this
assurance
said
mr
williams
see
you
again
before
you
oh
of
course
lorne
replied
i
ll
i
ll
come
round
by
the
way
williams
mr
milburn
didn
t
say
anything
anything
about
me
in
connection
with
this
business
didn
t
mention
i
suppose
what
he
thought
about
my
going
not
a
word
my
boy
he
was
away
up
in
abstract
principles
he
generally
is
it
s
gone
to
his
head
a
little
bit
only
natural
horace
reflected
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
s
probably
just
feeding
on
what
folks
think
of
it
as
if
it
mattered
a
pin
s
head
what
octavius
milburn
thinks
or
don
t
think
lorne
however
left
alone
with
his
customs
returns
and
his
immigration
reports
sat
still
attaching
a
weight
quite
out
of
comparison
with
a
pin
s
head
to
mr
milburn
s
opinion
he
turned
it
over
and
over
instead
of
the
tabulated
figures
that
were
his
business
he
had
to
show
himself
his
way
to
the
conclusion
that
such
a
thing
could
not
matter
seriously
in
the
end
since
milburn
hadn
t
a
dollar
involved
it
would
be
different
if
he
were
a
shareholder
in
the
maple
line
he
wished
heartily
nevertheless
that
he
could
demonstrate
a
special
advantage
to
in
competitive
freights
with
new
york
what
did
they
import
confound
them
plates
and
rivets
fortunately
he
was
in
a
position
to
get
at
the
facts
and
he
got
at
them
with
an
interest
of
even
greater
intensity
than
he
had
shown
to
the
whole
question
since
ten
that
morning
even
now
the
unprejudiced
observer
turning
up
the
literature
connected
with
the
cruickshank
deputation
may
notice
a
stress
laid
upon
the
advantages
to
canadian
importers
of
ore
in
certain
stages
of
manufacture
which
may
strike
him
as
slightly
very
slightly
special
of
course
there
are
a
good
many
of
them
in
the
country
so
that
mr
horace
williams
was
justified
to
some
extent
in
his
kindly
observation
upon
the
excusable
egotism
of
youth
two
or
three
letters
however
came
in
while
lorne
was
considering
the
relation
of
plates
and
rivets
to
the
objects
of
his
deputation
they
were
all
congratulatory
one
was
from
the
chairman
of
the
liberal
association
at
its
headquarters
in
toronto
lorne
glanced
at
them
and
stowed
them
away
in
his
pocket
he
would
read
them
when
he
got
home
when
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
hand
them
over
to
his
mother
she
was
making
a
collection
of
them
he
had
a
happy
perception
that
same
evening
that
mr
milburn
s
position
was
not
after
all
finally
and
invincibly
taken
against
the
deputation
and
everything
everybody
concerned
with
it
he
met
that
gentleman
at
his
own
garden
gate
octavius
paused
in
his
exit
to
hold
it
open
for
young
murchison
thus
even
assisting
the
act
of
entry
a
thing
which
thrilled
lorne
sweetly
enough
when
he
had
time
to
ponder
its
possible
significance
alas
the
significance
that
lovers
find
lorne
read
a
world
in
the
behaviour
of
dora
s
father
in
holding
the
gate
open
he
saw
political
principle
put
aside
in
his
favour
and
social
position
forgotten
in
kindness
to
him
he
saw
the
gravest
sincerest
appreciation
of
his
recent
success
which
he
took
as
humbly
as
a
dog
will
take
a
bone
he
read
a
fatherly
thought
at
which
his
pulses
bounded
in
an
arrogance
of
triumph
and
his
heart
rose
to
ask
its
trust
and
octavius
milburn
had
held
the
gate
open
because
it
was
more
convenient
to
hold
it
open
than
to
leave
it
open
he
had
not
a
political
view
in
the
world
that
was
calculated
to
affect
his
attitude
toward
a
practical
matter
and
his
opinion
of
lorne
was
quite
uncomplicated
he
thought
him
a
very
likely
young
fellow
milburn
himself
in
the
elgin
way
preferred
to
see
no
great
significance
of
this
sort
anywhere
young
people
were
young
people
it
was
natural
enough
that
they
should
like
each
other
s
society
they
the
milburns
were
very
glad
to
see
mr
murchison
very
glad
indeed
it
was
frequent
matter
for
veiled
humorous
reference
at
the
table
that
he
had
been
to
call
again
at
which
dora
would
look
very
stiff
and
dignified
and
have
to
be
coaxed
back
into
the
conversation
as
to
anything
serious
there
was
no
hurry
plenty
of
time
to
think
of
that
such
matters
dwelt
under
the
horizon
there
was
no
need
to
scan
them
closely
and
mr
milburn
went
his
way
conscious
of
nothing
more
than
a
comfortable
gratification
that
dora
so
far
as
the
young
men
were
concerned
seemed
as
popular
as
other
girls
dora
was
not
in
the
young
ladies
in
elgin
had
always
to
be
summoned
from
somewhere
for
all
the
filkin
instinct
for
the
conservation
of
polite
tradition
dora
was
probably
reading
the
toronto
society
weekly
illustrated
with
correspondents
all
over
the
province
on
the
back
verandah
and
but
for
the
irruption
of
a
visitor
would
probably
not
have
entered
the
formal
apartment
of
the
house
at
all
that
evening
in
elgin
had
their
prescribed
uses
to
receive
in
to
practise
in
and
for
the
last
sad
entertainment
of
the
dead
when
the
furniture
was
disarranged
to
accommodate
the
trestles
but
the
common
business
of
life
went
on
outside
them
even
among
prosperous
people
the
survival
perhaps
of
a
habit
based
upon
thrift
the
shutters
were
opened
when
lorne
entered
to
let
in
the
spring
twilight
and
the
servant
pulled
a
chair
into
its
proper
relation
with
the
room
as
she
went
out
mrs
milburn
and
miss
filkin
both
came
in
before
dora
did
lorne
found
their
conversation
enchanting
though
it
was
mostly
about
the
difficulty
of
keeping
the
lawn
tidy
they
had
had
so
much
rain
mrs
milburn
assured
him
kindly
that
there
was
not
such
another
lawn
as
his
father
s
in
elgin
how
mr
murchison
managed
to
have
it
looking
so
nice
always
she
could
not
think
only
yesterday
she
and
mr
milburn
had
stopped
to
admire
it
as
they
passed
spring
is
always
a
beautiful
time
in
elgin
she
remarked
there
are
so
many
pretty
houses
here
each
standing
in
its
own
grounds
nothing
very
grand
as
i
tell
my
friend
miss
cham
from
buffalo
where
the
residences
are
of
course
on
quite
a
different
scale
but
grandeur
isn
t
everything
is
it
no
indeed
said
lorne
but
you
will
be
leaving
for
great
britain
very
soon
now
mr
murchison
said
miss
filkin
leaving
elgin
and
all
its
beauties
and
i
dare
say
you
won
t
think
of
them
once
again
till
you
get
back
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
so
busy
as
that
miss
oh
no
i
m
sure
mr
murchison
won
t
forget
his
native
town
altogether
said
mrs
milburn
though
perhaps
he
won
t
like
it
so
well
after
seeing
dear
old
england
i
expect
said
lorne
simply
to
like
it
well
of
course
we
shall
all
be
pleased
if
you
say
that
mr
murchison
mrs
milburn
replied
graciously
we
shall
feel
quite
complimented
but
i
m
afraid
you
will
find
a
great
deal
to
criticize
when
you
come
back
that
is
if
you
go
at
all
into
society
over
there
i
always
say
there
can
be
nothing
like
good
english
i
want
to
attend
a
sitting
of
the
house
lorne
said
i
hope
i
shall
have
time
for
that
i
want
to
see
those
fellows
handling
their
public
business
i
don
t
believe
i
shall
find
our
men
so
far
behind
for
point
of
view
and
grasp
and
dispatch
of
course
there
s
always
wallingham
to
make
a
standard
for
us
all
but
they
haven
t
got
so
many
wasn
t
it
wallingham
louisa
that
mr
milburn
was
saying
at
breakfast
was
such
a
dangerous
man
so
able
he
said
but
dangerous
something
to
do
with
the
oh
said
lorne
and
he
said
no
more
for
at
that
moment
dora
came
in
she
came
in
looking
very
straight
and
graceful
and
composed
her
personal
note
was
carried
out
in
her
pretty
clothes
which
hung
and
sat
upon
her
like
the
rhythm
of
verses
they
could
fall
no
other
way
she
had
in
every
movement
the
definite
accent
of
young
ladyhood
she
was
very
much
aware
of
herself
of
the
situation
and
of
her
value
in
it
a
setting
for
herself
she
saw
it
and
saw
it
truly
no
one
from
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
looked
at
anything
else
oh
mr
murchison
she
said
how
do
you
do
mother
do
you
mind
if
i
open
the
window
it
s
quite
warm
out
of
doors
regular
lorne
sprang
to
open
the
window
while
miss
filkin
murmuring
that
it
had
been
a
beautiful
day
moved
a
little
farther
from
it
oh
please
don
t
trouble
mr
murchison
thank
you
very
much
miss
milburn
continued
and
subsided
on
a
sofa
have
you
been
playing
tennis
this
week
mr
murchison
said
that
he
had
been
able
to
get
down
to
the
club
only
once
the
courts
aren
t
a
bit
in
good
order
they
want
about
a
week
s
rolling
the
balls
get
up
anywhere
said
dora
lawn
tennis
mrs
milburn
asserted
herself
is
a
delightful
exercise
i
hope
it
will
never
go
out
of
fashion
but
that
is
what
we
used
to
say
of
croquet
and
it
has
gone
out
and
come
in
lorne
listened
to
this
with
deference
there
was
a
hint
of
patience
in
the
regard
dora
turned
upon
her
mother
mrs
milburn
continued
to
dilate
upon
lawn
tennis
dealt
lightly
with
badminton
and
brought
the
conversation
round
with
a
graceful
sweep
to
canoeing
dora
s
attitude
before
she
had
done
became
slightly
permissive
but
mrs
milburn
held
on
till
she
had
accomplished
her
conception
of
conduct
for
the
occasion
then
she
remembered
a
meeting
in
the
schoolhouse
we
are
to
have
an
address
by
an
indian
bishop
she
told
them
he
is
on
his
way
to
england
by
china
and
japan
and
is
staying
with
our
dear
rector
mr
murchison
such
a
treat
i
expect
it
will
what
i
am
dying
to
know
said
miss
filkin
in
a
sprightly
way
is
whether
he
is
black
or
white
mrs
milburn
then
left
the
room
and
shortly
afterward
miss
filkin
thought
she
could
not
miss
the
bishop
either
conveying
the
feeling
that
a
bishop
was
a
bishop
of
whatever
colour
she
stayed
three
minutes
longer
than
mrs
milburn
but
she
went
the
filkin
tradition
though
strong
could
not
hold
out
entirely
against
the
unwritten
laws
the
silently
claimed
privileges
of
youth
in
elgin
it
made
its
pretence
and
vanished
even
as
the
door
closed
the
two
that
were
left
looked
at
one
another
with
a
new
significance
a
simpler
relation
established
itself
between
them
and
controlled
all
that
surrounded
them
the
very
twilight
seemed
conscious
with
it
the
chairs
and
tables
stood
in
attentive
harmony
you
know
said
dora
i
hate
your
going
lorne
she
did
indeed
seem
moved
about
the
mouth
to
discontent
there
was
some
little
injury
in
the
way
she
swung
her
foot
i
was
hoping
mr
fulke
wouldn
t
get
better
in
time
i
was
truly
the
gratitude
in
young
murchison
s
eyes
should
have
been
dear
to
her
i
don
t
know
whether
she
saw
it
but
she
must
have
been
aware
that
she
was
saying
what
touched
him
making
her
point
oh
it
s
a
good
thing
to
go
a
good
thing
for
you
and
the
regatta
coming
off
the
first
week
in
june
and
a
whole
crowd
coming
from
toronto
for
it
there
isn
t
another
person
in
town
i
care
to
canoe
with
lorne
you
know
perfectly
well
i
m
awfully
sorry
said
lorne
i
wish
oh
i
m
going
i
believe
stephen
stuart
has
written
from
toronto
and
asked
me
to
sail
with
him
i
haven
t
told
mother
but
he
s
my
second
cousin
so
i
suppose
she
won
t
make
a
the
young
man
s
face
clouded
seeing
which
she
relented
oh
of
course
i
m
glad
you
re
going
really
she
assured
him
and
we
ll
all
be
proud
to
be
acquainted
with
such
a
distinguished
gentleman
when
you
get
back
do
you
think
you
ll
see
the
king
you
might
you
know
in
i
ll
see
him
if
he
s
visible
laughed
lorne
that
would
be
something
to
tell
your
mother
wouldn
t
it
but
i
m
afraid
we
won
t
be
doing
business
with
his
i
expect
you
ll
have
the
loveliest
time
you
ever
had
in
all
your
life
do
you
think
you
ll
be
asked
out
much
lorne
i
can
t
imagine
who
would
ask
me
we
ll
get
off
easy
if
the
street
boys
don
t
shout
what
price
canucks
at
us
but
i
ll
see
england
dora
i
ll
feel
england
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
live
in
england
for
a
little
while
isn
t
the
very
name
great
i
ll
be
a
better
man
for
going
till
i
die
we
re
all
right
out
here
but
we
re
young
and
thin
and
weedy
they
didn
t
grow
so
fast
in
england
to
begin
with
and
now
they
re
rich
with
character
and
strong
with
conduct
and
hoary
with
ideals
i
ve
been
reading
up
the
history
of
our
political
relations
with
england
it
s
astonishing
what
we
ve
stuck
to
her
through
but
you
can
t
help
seeing
why
it
s
for
the
moral
advantage
way
down
at
the
bottom
that
s
what
it
is
we
have
the
sense
to
want
all
we
can
get
of
that
sort
of
thing
they
ve
developed
the
finest
human
product
there
is
the
cleanest
the
most
disinterested
and
we
want
to
keep
up
the
relationship
it
s
important
their
talk
about
the
value
of
their
protection
doesn
t
take
in
the
situation
as
it
is
now
who
would
touch
us
if
we
were
running
our
own
show
i
don
t
believe
they
are
a
bit
better
than
we
are
replied
miss
milburn
i
m
sure
i
haven
t
much
opinion
of
the
englishmen
that
come
out
here
they
don
t
think
anything
of
getting
into
debt
and
as
often
as
not
they
drink
and
they
never
know
enough
to
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
but
lorne
yes
but
we
re
very
apt
to
get
the
failures
the
fellows
their
folks
give
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
to
and
tell
them
they
re
not
expected
back
till
they
re
making
a
living
the
best
men
find
their
level
somewhere
else
along
recognized
channels
lord
knows
we
don
t
want
them
this
country
s
for
immigrants
we
re
manufacturing
our
own
gentlemen
quite
fast
enough
for
the
i
should
think
we
were
why
lorne
canadians
nice
canadians
are
just
as
gentlemanly
as
they
can
be
they
ll
compare
with
anybody
perhaps
americans
have
got
more
style
she
weighed
the
matter
but
canadians
are
much
better
form
i
think
but
lorne
how
perfectly
dear
of
you
to
send
me
those
roses
i
wore
them
and
nobody
there
had
such
beauties
all
the
girls
wanted
to
know
where
i
got
them
but
i
only
told
lily
just
to
make
her
feel
a
pig
for
not
having
asked
you
my
very
greatest
friend
she
just
about
apologized
told
me
she
wanted
to
ask
about
twenty
more
people
but
her
mother
wouldn
t
let
her
they
ve
lost
an
uncle
or
something
lately
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
clara
sims
staying
with
them
they
wouldn
t
have
been
giving
i
ll
try
to
survive
not
having
been
asked
but
i
m
glad
you
wore
the
roses
i
dropped
one
and
phil
carter
wanted
to
keep
it
he
s
so
silly
did
you
did
you
let
him
keep
it
lorne
murchison
do
you
think
i
d
let
any
man
keep
a
rose
i
d
been
wearing
he
looked
at
her
suddenly
emboldened
i
don
t
know
about
roses
dora
but
pansies
those
are
awfully
nice
ones
in
your
dress
i
m
very
fond
of
pansies
couldn
t
you
spare
me
one
i
wouldn
t
ask
for
a
rose
but
a
pansy
his
eyes
were
more
ardent
than
what
he
found
to
say
beneath
them
dora
grew
delicately
pink
the
pansies
drooped
a
little
she
put
her
slender
fingers
under
one
and
lifted
its
petals
it
s
too
faded
for
your
buttonhole
she
said
it
needn
t
stay
in
my
buttonhole
i
know
lots
of
other
places
he
begged
dora
considered
the
pansy
again
then
she
pulled
it
slowly
out
and
the
young
man
got
up
and
went
over
to
her
proffering
the
lapel
of
his
coat
it
spoils
the
bunch
she
said
prettily
if
i
give
you
this
you
will
have
to
give
me
something
to
take
its
i
will
said
lorne
i
know
it
will
be
something
better
said
dora
and
there
was
a
little
effort
in
her
composure
you
send
people
such
beautiful
flowers
she
rose
beside
him
as
she
spoke
graceful
and
fair
to
fasten
it
in
and
it
was
his
hand
that
shook
then
may
i
choose
it
said
lorne
and
will
you
wear
it
i
suppose
you
may
why
are
you
why
do
you
oh
lorne
stand
still
i
ll
give
you
you
sweet
girl
my
whole
heart
he
said
in
the
vague
tender
knowledge
that
he
offered
her
a
garden
where
she
had
but
to
walk
and
smile
to
bring
about
her
unimaginable
blooms
chapter
xiii
they
sat
talking
on
the
verandah
in
the
close
of
the
may
evening
mr
and
mrs
murchison
the
plummer
place
was
the
murchison
place
in
the
town
s
mouth
now
and
that
was
only
fair
the
murchisons
had
overstamped
the
plummers
it
lay
about
them
like
a
map
of
their
lives
the
big
horse
chestnut
stood
again
in
flower
to
lighten
the
spring
dusk
for
them
as
it
had
done
faithfully
for
thirty
years
john
was
no
longer
in
his
the
growing
authority
of
his
family
had
long
prescribed
a
black
alpaca
coat
he
smoked
his
meerschaum
with
the
same
old
deliberation
however
holding
it
by
the
bowl
as
considerately
as
he
held
its
original
which
lasted
him
fifteen
years
a
great
deal
of
john
murchison
s
character
was
there
in
the
way
he
held
his
pipe
his
gentleness
and
patience
even
the
justice
and
repose
and
quiet
strength
of
his
nature
he
smoked
and
read
the
paper
the
unfailing
double
solace
of
his
evenings
i
should
have
said
that
it
was
mrs
murchison
who
talked
she
had
the
advantage
of
a
free
mind
only
subconsciously
occupied
with
her
white
wool
and
agile
needles
and
john
had
frequently
to
choose
between
her
observations
and
the
politics
of
the
day
you
saw
lorne
s
letter
this
morning
father
john
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
yes
he
said
he
seems
tremendously
taken
up
with
wallingham
it
was
all
wallingham
from
one
end
to
the
it
s
not
remarkable
said
john
murchison
patiently
you
d
think
he
had
nothing
else
to
write
about
there
was
that
reception
at
lord
s
the
canadian
commissioner
s
when
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
came
and
brought
their
family
i
d
like
to
have
heard
something
more
about
that
than
just
that
he
was
there
he
might
have
noticed
what
the
children
had
on
now
that
abby
s
family
is
coming
about
her
i
seem
to
have
my
hands
as
full
of
children
s
clothes
as
ever
i
had
abby
seems
to
think
there
s
nothing
like
my
old
patterns
i
m
sure
i
m
sick
of
the
sight
of
them
mr
murchison
refolded
his
newspaper
took
his
pipe
once
more
from
his
mouth
and
said
nothing
john
put
down
that
paper
i
declare
it
s
enough
to
drive
anybody
crazy
now
look
at
that
boy
walking
across
the
lawn
he
does
it
every
night
delivering
the
express
and
you
take
no
more
notice
he
s
wearing
a
regular
path
sonny
said
mr
murchison
as
the
urchin
approached
you
mustn
t
walk
across
the
much
good
that
will
do
remarked
mrs
murchison
i
d
teach
him
to
walk
across
the
grass
if
if
it
were
my
business
boy
isn
t
your
name
willie
parker
then
it
was
your
mother
i
promised
the
coat
and
the
other
things
to
and
you
ll
find
them
ready
there
just
inside
the
hall
door
they
ll
make
down
very
well
for
you
but
you
can
tell
her
from
me
that
she
d
better
them
for
the
stuff
s
apt
to
ravel
and
attend
to
what
mr
murchison
says
go
out
by
the
gravel
what
do
you
suppose
it
s
there
for
mrs
murchison
readjusted
her
glasses
and
turned
another
row
of
the
tiny
sock
i
must
say
it
s
a
pleasure
to
have
the
lawn
neat
and
green
she
said
with
a
sigh
never
did
i
expect
to
see
the
day
it
would
be
anything
but
chickweed
and
dandelions
we
ve
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
for
and
all
our
children
spared
to
us
too
john
she
continued
casting
a
shrewd
glance
over
her
needles
at
nothing
in
particular
do
you
suppose
anything
was
settled
between
lorne
and
dora
milburn
before
he
started
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
oh
well
very
likely
he
wouldn
t
young
people
keep
such
a
tremendous
lot
to
themselves
nowadays
but
it
s
my
belief
they
ve
come
to
an
lily
might
do
worse
said
john
murchison
judicially
i
should
think
dora
might
do
worse
i
don
t
know
where
she
s
going
to
do
better
the
most
promising
young
man
in
elgin
well
brought
up
well
educated
well
started
in
a
profession
there
s
not
a
young
fellow
in
this
town
to
compare
with
lorne
and
perfectly
well
you
know
it
john
might
do
worse
but
that
s
you
all
over
belittle
your
own
belongings
mr
murchison
smiled
in
amused
tolerance
they
ve
always
got
you
to
blow
their
trumpet
mother
he
replied
and
more
than
me
you
ought
to
hear
dr
drummond
about
lorne
he
says
that
if
the
english
government
starts
that
line
of
boats
to
halifax
the
country
will
owe
it
to
him
much
more
than
to
cruickshank
or
anybody
dr
drummond
likes
to
talk
said
john
murchison
lorne
s
keeping
his
end
up
all
right
remarked
stella
jumping
off
her
bicycle
in
time
to
hear
what
her
mother
said
it
s
great
that
old
wallingham
asking
him
to
dinner
and
haven
t
i
just
been
spreading
it
where
have
you
been
stella
asked
mrs
murchison
oh
only
over
to
the
milburns
dora
asked
me
to
come
and
show
her
the
new
for
table
centres
dora
s
suddenly
taken
to
fancy
work
she
s
started
a
lot
a
lot
too
much
stella
added
gloomily
if
dora
likes
to
do
fancy
work
i
don
t
see
why
anybody
should
want
to
stop
her
remarked
mrs
murchison
with
a
meaning
glance
at
her
husband
i
suppose
she
thinks
she
s
going
to
get
lorne
said
stella
her
resentment
was
only
but
the
note
was
there
what
put
that
into
your
head
asked
her
mother
oh
well
anybody
can
see
that
he
s
devoted
to
her
and
has
been
for
ages
and
it
isn
t
as
if
lorne
was
one
to
have
girlfriends
she
s
absolutely
the
only
thing
he
s
ever
looked
at
twice
she
hasn
t
got
a
ring
that
s
true
but
it
would
be
just
like
her
to
want
him
to
get
it
in
england
and
i
know
they
correspond
she
doesn
t
make
any
secret
of
oh
i
dare
say
other
people
have
eyes
in
their
head
as
well
as
you
stella
said
mrs
murchison
stooping
for
her
ball
but
there
s
no
need
to
take
things
for
granted
at
such
a
rate
and
above
all
you
re
not
to
go
talking
remember
well
if
you
think
dora
milburn
s
good
enough
returned
lorne
s
youngest
sister
in
threatening
accents
it
s
more
than
i
do
that
s
all
hello
miss
murchison
she
continued
as
advena
appeared
you
re
looking
xtremely
expecting
his
reverence
advena
made
no
further
reply
than
a
look
of
scornful
amusement
which
stella
bicycling
forth
again
received
in
the
back
of
her
head
father
said
mrs
murchison
if
you
had
taken
any
share
in
the
bringing
up
of
this
family
stella
ought
to
have
her
ears
boxed
this
minute
we
ll
have
to
box
them
said
mr
murchison
when
she
comes
advena
had
retreated
into
the
house
is
she
expecting
his
reverence
asked
her
father
with
a
twinkle
don
t
ask
me
i
m
sure
it
s
more
than
i
can
tell
you
it
s
a
mystery
to
me
that
matter
altogether
i
ve
known
him
come
three
evenings
in
a
week
and
not
again
for
a
month
of
sundays
and
when
he
does
come
there
they
sit
talking
about
their
books
and
their
authors
you
d
think
the
world
had
nothing
else
in
it
i
know
for
i
ve
heard
them
hard
at
it
there
in
the
library
books
and
authors
won
t
keep
their
house
or
look
after
their
family
for
them
i
can
tell
them
that
if
it
does
come
to
anything
which
i
hope
it
won
finlay
s
fine
in
the
pulpit
said
john
murchison
cautiously
oh
the
man
s
well
enough
it
s
him
i
m
sorry
for
i
don
t
call
advena
fitted
to
be
a
wife
and
last
of
all
a
minister
s
abby
was
a
treasure
for
any
man
to
get
and
stella
won
t
turn
out
at
all
badly
she
s
taking
hold
very
well
for
her
age
but
advena
simply
hasn
t
got
it
in
her
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
say
about
mrs
murchison
pulled
her
needles
out
right
side
out
with
finality
i
don
t
deny
the
girl
s
talented
in
her
own
way
but
it
s
no
way
to
marry
on
she
d
much
better
make
up
her
mind
just
to
be
a
happy
independent
old
maid
any
woman
might
do
worse
and
take
no
there
would
always
be
you
mother
for
them
to
fall
back
it
was
as
near
as
john
murchison
ever
got
to
flattery
no
thank
you
then
i
ve
brought
up
six
of
my
own
as
well
as
i
was
able
which
isn
t
saying
much
and
a
hard
life
i
ve
had
of
it
now
i
m
done
with
it
they
ll
have
to
find
somebody
else
to
fall
back
on
if
they
get
themselves
into
such
a
mess
mrs
murchison
stopped
to
laugh
with
sincere
enjoyment
they
needn
t
look
to
me
to
get
them
i
guess
you
d
have
a
hand
not
i
but
the
man
isn
t
thinking
of
any
such
folly
what
do
you
suppose
his
salary
is
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
they
raised
it
last
and
how
far
would
advena
be
able
to
make
that
go
with
servants
getting
the
money
they
do
and
expecting
the
washing
put
out
as
a
matter
of
course
do
you
remember
eliza
john
that
we
had
when
we
were
first
married
seven
dollars
a
month
she
got
she
would
split
wood
at
a
pinch
and
i
ve
never
had
one
since
that
could
do
up
shirts
like
her
three
years
and
a
half
she
was
with
me
and
did
everything
everything
i
didn
t
do
but
that
was
management
and
advena
s
no
manager
it
would
be
me
that
would
tell
him
if
i
had
the
chance
then
he
couldn
t
say
he
hadn
t
been
warned
but
i
don
t
think
he
has
any
such
advena
pronounced
mr
murchison
might
do
well
i
don
t
know
whether
she
might
the
creature
is
well
enough
to
preach
before
a
congregation
but
what
she
can
see
in
him
out
of
the
pulpit
is
more
than
i
know
a
great
gawk
of
a
fellow
with
eyes
that
always
look
as
if
he
were
in
the
middle
of
next
week
he
may
be
able
to
talk
to
advena
but
he
s
no
hand
at
general
conversation
i
know
he
finds
precious
little
to
say
to
me
but
he
s
got
no
such
notion
he
comes
here
because
being
human
he
s
got
to
open
his
mouth
some
time
or
other
i
suppose
but
it
s
my
opinion
he
has
neither
advena
nor
anybody
else
in
his
mind
s
eye
at
present
he
doesn
t
go
the
right
way
about
h
m
said
john
murchison
he
brought
her
a
book
the
last
time
he
came
what
do
you
think
the
name
of
it
was
the
something
or
other
of
plato
do
you
call
that
a
natural
gift
from
a
young
man
who
is
thinking
seriously
of
a
girl
besides
if
i
know
anything
about
plato
he
was
a
greek
heathen
and
no
writer
for
a
presbyterian
minister
to
go
lending
around
i
d
plato
him
to
the
rightabout
if
it
was
me
she
might
read
worse
than
plato
remarked
john
oh
well
she
read
it
fast
enough
she
s
your
own
daughter
for
outlandish
books
mercy
on
us
here
comes
the
man
we
ll
just
say
how
d
ye
do
to
him
and
then
start
for
abby
s
john
i
m
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
the
baby
and
i
haven
t
been
over
since
the
morning
harry
says
it
s
nothing
but
stomach
but
i
think
i
know
when
i
hear
it
and
if
it
is
the
boy
will
have
to
come
here
and
rampage
i
suppose
till
they
re
clear
of
it
there
s
some
use
in
grandmothers
if
i
do
say
it
myself
chapter
xiv
if
anyone
had
told
mr
hugh
finlay
while
he
was
pursuing
his
rigorous
path
to
the
ideals
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
that
the
first
notable
interest
of
his
life
in
the
calling
and
the
country
to
which
even
then
he
had
given
his
future
would
lie
in
his
relations
with
any
woman
he
would
have
treated
the
prediction
as
mere
folly
to
go
far
enough
back
in
accounting
for
this
one
would
arrive
at
the
female
sort
sterling
and
arid
that
had
presided
over
his
childhood
and
represented
the
sex
to
his
youth
the
aunt
lizzie
widowed
and
frugal
and
spare
who
had
brought
him
up
the
janet
wilson
who
had
washed
and
mended
him
from
babyhood
good
gaunt
creature
and
the
mature
respectable
women
and
impossible
blowsy
girls
of
the
dumfriesshire
village
whence
he
came
with
such
as
these
relations
actual
or
imagined
could
only
be
of
the
most
practical
kind
matters
to
be
arranged
on
grounds
of
expediency
and
certainly
not
of
the
first
importance
the
things
of
first
importance
what
you
could
do
with
your
energy
and
your
brains
to
beat
out
some
microscopic
good
for
the
world
and
what
you
could
see
and
feel
and
realize
in
it
of
value
to
yourself
left
little
room
for
the
feminine
consideration
in
finlay
s
eyes
it
was
not
a
thing
simply
that
existed
there
with
any
significance
woman
in
her
more
attractive
presentment
was
a
daughter
of
the
poets
with
an
esoteric
or
perhaps
only
a
symbolic
or
perhaps
a
merely
decorative
function
in
any
case
a
creature
that
required
an
initiation
to
perceive
her
a
process
to
which
finlay
would
have
been
as
unwilling
as
he
was
unlikely
to
submit
not
that
he
was
destitute
of
ideals
about
women
they
would
have
formed
in
that
case
a
strange
exception
to
his
general
outlook
but
he
saw
them
on
a
plane
detached
and
impersonal
concerned
with
the
preservation
of
society
the
maintenance
of
the
home
the
noble
devotions
of
motherhood
women
had
been
known
historically
to
be
capable
of
lofty
sentiments
and
fine
actions
he
would
have
been
the
last
to
withhold
their
due
from
women
but
they
were
removed
from
the
scope
of
his
imagination
partly
by
the
accidents
i
have
mentioned
and
partly
no
doubt
by
a
simple
lack
in
him
of
the
inclination
to
seek
and
to
know
them
so
that
christie
cameron
when
she
came
to
stay
with
his
aunt
in
bross
during
the
few
weeks
after
his
ordination
and
before
his
departure
for
canada
found
a
fair
light
for
judgement
and
more
than
a
reasonable
disposition
to
acquiesce
in
the
scale
of
her
merits
as
a
woman
on
the
part
of
hugh
finlay
he
was
familiar
with
the
scale
of
her
merits
before
she
came
his
aunt
lizzie
did
little
but
run
them
up
and
down
when
she
arrived
she
answered
to
every
item
she
was
a
good
height
but
not
too
tall
a
nice
figure
of
a
woman
but
not
what
you
would
call
stout
a
body
whose
excellent
principles
were
written
in
every
feature
she
had
she
was
five
years
older
than
hugh
but
even
that
he
came
to
accept
in
aunt
lizzie
s
skilful
exhibition
as
something
to
the
total
of
her
advantages
a
pleasant
independent
creature
with
a
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
sensible
and
vigorous
and
belonging
as
well
to
the
right
denomination
she
had
virtues
that
might
have
figured
handsomely
in
an
advertisement
had
aunt
lizzie
in
the
plenitude
of
her
good
will
thought
fit
to
take
that
measure
on
christie
s
behalf
but
nothing
was
farther
from
aunt
lizzie
s
mind
we
must
in
fairness
add
christie
cameron
to
the
sum
of
finlay
s
acquaintance
with
the
sex
but
even
then
the
total
is
slender
little
to
go
upon
yet
the
fact
which
mr
finlay
would
in
those
days
have
considered
so
unimaginable
remained
it
had
come
into
being
and
it
remained
the
chief
interest
of
his
life
the
chief
human
interest
did
lie
in
his
relations
with
advena
murchison
he
might
challenge
it
but
he
could
not
move
it
he
might
explain
but
he
could
not
alter
it
and
there
had
come
no
point
at
which
it
would
have
occurred
to
him
to
do
either
when
at
last
he
had
seen
how
simple
and
possible
it
was
to
enjoy
miss
murchison
s
companionship
upon
unoccupied
evenings
he
had
begun
to
do
it
with
eagerness
and
zest
the
greater
because
elgin
offered
him
practically
no
other
dr
drummond
lived
for
purposes
of
intellectual
contact
at
the
other
end
of
the
century
the
other
clergy
and
professional
men
of
the
town
were
separated
from
finlay
by
all
the
mental
predispositions
that
rose
from
the
virgin
soil
he
was
as
mrs
murchison
said
a
great
gawk
of
a
fellow
he
had
little
adaptability
he
was
not
of
those
who
spend
a
year
or
two
in
the
new
world
and
go
back
with
a
accent
either
of
tongue
or
of
mind
where
he
saw
a
lack
of
dignity
of
consideration
or
of
restraint
he
did
not
insensibly
become
less
dignified
or
considerate
or
restrained
to
smooth
out
perceptible
differences
nor
was
he
constituted
to
absorb
the
qualities
of
those
defects
and
enrich
his
nature
by
the
geniality
the
shrewdness
the
quick
mental
movement
that
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
account
he
cherished
in
secret
an
admiration
for
the
young
men
of
elgin
with
their
unappeasable
energy
and
their
indomitable
optimism
but
he
could
not
translate
it
in
any
language
of
sympathy
and
but
for
advena
his
soul
would
have
gone
uncomforted
and
alone
advena
as
we
know
was
his
companion
seeing
herself
just
that
constantly
content
to
be
just
that
she
walked
beside
him
closer
than
he
knew
she
had
her
woman
s
prescience
and
trusted
it
her
own
heart
all
sweetly
alive
counselled
her
to
patience
her
instincts
laid
her
in
bonds
to
concealment
she
knew
she
was
sure
so
sure
that
she
could
play
sometimes
smiling
with
her
living
heart
the
nightingale
was
not
yet
heard
for
the
rose
was
not
yet
blown
she
could
say
of
his
and
what
was
that
but
play
and
tender
laughter
at
the
expense
of
her
own
and
then
perhaps
looking
up
from
the
same
book
she
would
whisper
alone
in
her
room
oh
speed
the
day
thou
dear
dear
may
and
gaze
humbly
through
tears
at
her
own
face
in
the
glass
loving
it
on
his
behalf
she
took
her
passion
with
the
weight
of
a
thing
ordained
she
had
come
upon
it
where
it
waited
for
her
and
they
had
gone
on
together
carrying
the
secret
there
might
be
farther
to
go
but
the
way
could
never
be
long
finlay
said
when
he
came
in
that
the
heat
for
may
was
extraordinary
and
advena
reminded
him
that
he
was
in
a
country
where
everything
was
accomplished
quickly
even
summer
except
perhaps
she
added
they
were
both
young
enough
to
be
pleased
with
cleverness
for
its
specious
self
oh
that
is
slow
everywhere
he
observed
but
how
you
can
say
so
with
every
modern
improvement
staring
you
in
the
face
electric
cars
and
telephones
oh
i
didn
t
say
we
hadn
t
the
products
and
she
laughed
but
the
thing
itself
the
precious
thing
that
never
comes
just
by
wishing
does
it
the
art
of
indifference
the
art
of
choice
if
you
had
refinements
in
the
beginning
what
would
the
end
be
he
demanded
oh
i
don
t
quarrel
with
the
logic
of
it
i
only
point
out
the
fact
to
do
that
is
to
acquiesce
really
i
acquiesce
i
have
to
but
one
may
long
for
the
more
delicate
appreciations
that
seem
to
flower
where
life
has
gone
on
i
imagine
finlay
said
that
to
wish
truly
and
ardently
for
such
things
is
to
possess
them
if
you
didn
t
possess
them
you
wouldn
t
desire
them
as
they
say
as
they
say
as
they
say
about
love
some
novelist
does
to
be
conscious
in
any
way
toward
it
is
to
be
fatally
what
novelist
advena
asked
with
shining
interest
some
novelist
i
i
can
t
have
invented
it
he
replied
somewhat
confounded
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
where
it
stood
open
upon
the
verandah
i
don
t
write
novels
he
said
perhaps
you
live
them
suggested
advena
i
mean
of
course
she
added
laughing
the
highest
class
of
heaven
forbid
why
heaven
forbid
you
are
sensitive
to
life
and
a
great
deal
of
it
comes
into
your
scope
you
can
t
see
a
thing
truly
without
feeling
it
you
can
t
feel
it
without
living
it
i
don
t
write
novels
either
but
i
experience
whole
publishers
that
means
he
said
smiling
that
your
vision
is
up
to
date
you
see
the
things
the
kind
of
things
that
you
read
of
next
day
the
modern
moral
sophistications
don
t
make
me
out
boastful
she
replied
i
often
mine
would
be
i
am
afraid
old
stories
of
pain
he
looked
out
upon
the
lawn
white
where
the
chestnut
blossoms
were
dropping
and
his
eyes
were
just
wistful
enough
to
stir
her
adoration
and
of
heroism
that
is
quite
dateless
in
the
history
of
the
human
heart
at
least
one
likes
to
hope
i
somehow
think
she
ventured
timidly
that
yours
would
be
finlay
withdrew
his
glance
abruptly
from
the
falling
blossoms
as
if
they
had
tempted
him
to
an
expansion
he
could
not
justify
he
was
impatient
always
of
the
personal
note
and
in
his
intercourse
with
miss
murchison
he
seemed
of
late
to
be
constantly
sounding
it
oh
i
don
t
know
he
said
almost
irritably
i
only
meant
that
i
see
the
obvious
things
while
you
seem
to
have
an
eye
for
the
subtle
there
s
reward
i
suppose
in
seeing
anything
but
about
those
more
delicate
appreciations
of
societies
longer
evolved
i
sometimes
think
that
you
don
t
half
realize
in
a
country
like
this
how
much
there
is
to
make
is
there
anything
really
to
make
up
she
asked
oh
so
much
freedom
from
old
habits
inherited
problems
look
at
the
absurd
difficulty
they
have
in
england
in
handling
such
a
matter
as
education
here
you
can
t
even
conceive
it
the
schools
have
been
on
logical
lines
from
the
beginning
or
almost
political
activity
over
there
is
at
this
moment
by
the
secular
arm
of
religion
here
it
doesn
t
even
impede
the
circulation
conceive
any
church
or
the
united
churches
for
the
matter
of
that
asking
a
place
in
the
conduct
of
the
common
schools
of
ontario
how
would
the
people
take
it
with
anger
or
with
laughter
but
certainly
with
sense
by
all
mean
let
the
ministers
serve
education
on
the
school
boards
they
would
say
by
election
like
other
people
an
opportunity
by
the
way
which
has
just
been
offered
to
me
i
m
nominated
for
east
elgin
in
place
of
leverett
the
tanner
who
is
leaving
the
town
i
shall
do
my
best
to
get
in
too
there
are
several
matters
that
want
seeing
to
over
there
the
girls
playground
for
one
thing
is
practically
under
water
in
the
you
should
get
in
without
the
least
difficulty
oh
yes
there
is
something
in
a
fresh
start
we
re
on
the
straight
road
as
a
nation
in
most
respects
we
haven
t
any
picturesque
old
prescribed
lanes
to
travel
so
you
think
that
makes
up
it
s
one
thing
you
might
put
down
space
an
empty
horizon
advena
murmured
for
faith
and
the
future
an
empty
horizon
is
better
than
none
england
has
filled
hers
up
she
has
now
these
and
he
nodded
at
a
window
open
to
the
yellow
west
advena
looked
with
him
oh
if
you
have
a
creative
imagination
she
said
like
wallingham
s
but
even
then
your
vision
must
be
only
political
economic
material
you
can
t
conceive
the
flowers
that
will
come
out
of
all
that
and
if
you
could
it
wouldn
t
be
like
having
and
the
scope
of
the
individual
his
chance
of
unhampered
by
the
traditions
of
class
which
either
deaden
it
or
irritate
it
in
england
his
chance
of
significance
and
success
and
the
splendid
buoyant
unused
air
to
breathe
and
the
simplicity
of
life
and
the
plenty
of
things
i
am
to
be
consoled
because
apples
are
you
are
to
be
consoled
for
a
hundred
reasons
doesn
t
it
console
you
to
feel
under
your
very
feet
the
forces
that
are
working
to
the
immense
amelioration
of
a
not
altogether
undeserving
people
no
said
advena
rebelliously
and
indeed
he
had
been
a
trifle
didactic
to
her
grievance
they
laughed
together
and
then
with
a
look
at
her
in
which
observation
seemed
suddenly
to
awake
finlay
said
and
those
things
aren
t
all
or
nearly
all
i
sometimes
think
that
the
human
spirit
as
it
is
set
free
in
these
wide
unblemished
spaces
may
be
something
more
pure
and
sensitive
more
sincerely
curious
about
what
is
good
and
beautiful
he
broke
off
still
gazing
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
idea
and
no
more
how
much
more
she
was
she
showed
him
by
a
vivid
and
beautiful
blush
i
am
glad
you
are
so
well
satisfied
she
said
and
then
as
if
her
words
had
carried
beyond
their
intention
she
blushed
again
upon
which
hugh
finlay
saw
his
idea
incarnate
chapter
xv
if
it
were
fair
or
adequate
to
so
quote
i
should
be
very
much
tempted
to
draw
the
history
of
lorne
murchison
s
sojourn
in
england
from
his
letters
home
he
put
his
whole
heart
into
these
his
discoveries
and
his
recognitions
and
his
young
enthusiasm
all
his
claimed
inheritance
all
that
he
found
to
criticize
and
to
love
his
mother
said
when
she
read
them
that
he
seemed
tremendously
taken
up
with
the
old
country
and
of
course
she
expressed
the
thing
exactly
as
she
always
did
he
was
tremendously
taken
up
with
it
the
old
country
fell
into
the
lines
of
his
imagination
from
the
towers
of
westminster
to
the
shops
in
the
strand
from
the
right
hon
fawcett
wallingham
who
laid
great
issues
before
the
public
to
the
man
who
sang
melancholy
hymns
to
the
same
public
up
and
down
the
benevolent
streets
it
was
naturally
london
that
filled
his
view
his
business
was
in
london
and
his
time
was
short
the
country
he
saw
from
the
train
whence
it
made
a
low
cloudy
frame
for
london
with
decorations
of
hedges
and
sheep
how
he
saw
london
how
he
carried
away
all
he
did
in
the
time
and
under
the
circumstances
may
be
thought
a
mystery
there
are
doubtless
people
who
would
consider
his
opportunities
too
limited
to
gather
anything
essential
cruickshank
was
the
only
one
of
the
deputation
who
had
been
over
before
and
they
all
followed
him
unquestioningly
to
the
temperance
hotel
of
his
preference
in
bloomsbury
where
bedrooms
were
three
and
six
and
tea
was
understood
as
a
solid
meal
and
the
last
in
the
day
bates
would
have
voted
for
the
metropole
and
mcgill
had
been
advised
that
you
saw
a
good
deal
of
life
at
the
cecil
but
they
bowed
to
cruickshank
s
experience
none
of
them
were
total
abstainers
but
neither
had
any
of
them
the
wine
habit
they
were
not
inconvenienced
therefore
in
taking
advantage
of
the
cheapness
with
which
total
abstinence
made
itself
attractive
and
they
took
it
though
they
were
substantial
men
as
one
of
them
put
it
they
weren
t
over
there
to
make
a
splash
a
thing
that
was
pretty
hard
to
do
in
london
anyhow
and
home
comforts
came
before
anything
the
conviction
about
the
splash
was
perhaps
a
little
the
teaching
of
circumstances
they
were
influential
fellows
at
home
who
had
lived
for
years
in
the
atmosphere
of
appreciation
that
surrounds
success
their
movements
were
observed
in
the
newspapers
their
names
stood
for
wide
interests
big
concerns
they
had
known
the
satisfaction
of
a
positive
importance
not
only
in
their
community
but
in
their
country
and
they
had
come
to
england
invested
as
well
with
the
weight
that
is
attached
to
a
public
mission
it
may
very
well
be
that
they
looked
for
some
echo
of
what
they
were
accustomed
to
and
were
a
little
dashed
not
to
find
it
to
find
the
merest
published
announcement
of
their
arrival
and
their
introduction
by
lord
selkirk
to
the
colonial
secretary
and
no
heads
turned
in
the
temperance
hotel
when
they
came
into
the
it
may
very
well
be
it
is
even
more
certain
however
that
they
took
the
lesson
as
they
found
it
with
the
quick
eye
for
things
as
they
are
which
seems
to
come
of
looking
at
things
as
they
will
be
and
with
just
that
humorous
comment
about
the
splash
it
would
be
misleading
to
say
that
they
were
humbled
i
doubt
whether
they
even
felt
their
relativity
whether
they
ever
dropped
consciously
there
in
the
bloomsbury
hotel
into
their
places
in
the
great
scale
of
london
observing
the
scale
recognizing
it
they
held
themselves
unaffected
by
it
they
kept
in
a
curious
positive
way
the
integrity
of
what
they
were
and
what
they
had
come
for
they
maintained
their
point
of
view
so
much
must
be
conceded
the
empire
produces
a
family
resemblance
but
here
and
there
when
oceans
intervene
a
different
mould
of
the
spirit
wallingham
certainly
invited
them
to
dinner
one
sunday
in
a
body
an
occasion
which
gave
one
or
two
of
them
some
anxiety
until
they
found
that
it
was
not
to
be
adorned
by
the
ladies
of
the
family
tricorne
was
there
president
of
the
board
of
trade
and
fleming
who
held
the
of
the
united
kingdom
two
ministers
whom
wallingham
had
asked
because
they
were
supposed
to
have
open
minds
open
that
is
to
say
for
purposes
of
assimilation
wallingham
considered
and
rightly
that
he
had
done
very
well
for
the
deputation
in
getting
these
two
there
were
other
colleagues
whose
attendance
he
would
have
liked
to
compel
but
one
of
them
deep
in
the
country
was
devoting
his
weekends
to
his
new
french
motor
and
the
other
to
the
proofs
of
a
book
upon
neglected
periods
of
mahommedan
history
and
both
were
at
the
breaking
strain
with
overwork
wallingham
asked
the
deputation
to
dinner
lord
selkirk
who
took
them
to
wallingham
dined
them
too
and
invited
them
to
one
of
those
garden
parties
for
the
sumptuous
scale
of
which
he
was
so
justly
famed
the
occasion
we
have
already
heard
about
upon
which
royalty
was
present
in
two
generations
they
travelled
to
it
by
special
train
a
circumstance
which
made
them
grave
receptive
and
even
slightly
ceremonious
with
one
another
lord
selkirk
with
royalty
on
his
hands
naturally
could
not
give
them
much
of
his
time
and
they
moved
about
in
a
cluster
avoiding
the
ladies
trains
and
advising
one
another
that
it
was
a
good
thing
the
high
commissioner
was
a
man
of
large
private
means
it
wasn
t
everybody
that
could
afford
to
take
the
job
yet
they
were
not
wholly
detached
from
the
occasion
they
looked
at
it
after
they
had
taken
it
in
with
an
air
all
this
had
in
a
manner
come
out
of
canada
and
canada
was
theirs
one
of
them
bates
it
was
responding
to
a
lady
who
was
effusive
about
the
strawberries
even
took
the
modestly
depreciatory
attitude
of
the
host
they
re
a
fair
size
for
this
country
ma
am
but
if
you
want
berries
with
a
flavour
we
ll
do
better
for
you
in
the
niagara
it
must
be
added
that
cruickshank
lunched
with
wallingham
at
his
club
and
with
tricorne
at
his
and
on
both
occasions
the
quiet
and
attentive
young
secretary
went
with
him
for
purposes
of
reference
his
pocket
bulging
with
memoranda
the
young
secretary
felt
a
little
embarrassed
to
justify
his
presence
at
tricorne
s
lunch
as
the
right
honourable
gentleman
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
his
guests
had
come
for
beyond
it
and
talked
exclusively
and
exhaustively
about
the
new
possibilities
for
in
england
cruickshank
fairly
shook
himself
into
his
overcoat
with
irritation
afterward
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
we
must
except
he
said
as
they
merged
upon
pall
mall
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
lorne
expected
but
we
know
him
unsophisticated
and
a
stranger
to
the
heart
of
the
empire
which
beats
through
such
impediment
of
accumulated
tissue
nor
was
it
the
sort
of
thing
they
got
from
wallingham
the
and
probing
whose
skill
in
adjusting
conflicting
interests
could
astonish
even
their
expectation
and
whose
vision
of
the
essentials
of
the
future
could
lift
even
their
enthusiasm
one
would
like
to
linger
over
their
touch
with
wallingham
that
fusion
of
energy
with
energy
that
straight
satisfying
accomplishing
dart
there
is
more
drama
here
no
doubt
than
in
all
the
pages
that
are
to
come
but
i
am
explaining
now
how
little
not
how
much
the
cruickshank
deputation
and
especially
lorne
murchison
had
the
opportunity
of
feeling
and
learning
in
london
in
order
to
show
how
wonderful
it
was
that
lorne
felt
and
learned
so
widely
that
what
he
absorbed
and
took
back
with
him
is
after
all
what
we
have
to
do
with
his
actual
adventures
are
of
no
great
importance
the
deputation
to
urge
improved
communications
within
the
empire
had
few
points
of
contact
with
the
great
world
but
its
members
were
drawn
into
engagements
of
their
own
more
indeed
than
some
of
them
could
conveniently
overtake
mr
bates
never
saw
his
niece
in
the
and
regrets
it
to
this
day
the
engagements
arose
partly
out
of
business
relations
poulton
who
was
a
dyspeptic
complained
that
nothing
could
be
got
through
in
london
without
eating
and
drinking
for
his
part
he
would
concede
a
point
any
time
not
to
eat
and
drink
but
you
could
not
do
it
you
just
had
to
suffer
poulton
was
a
principal
in
one
of
the
railway
companies
that
were
competing
to
open
up
the
country
south
of
hudson
s
bay
to
the
pacific
but
having
dealt
with
that
circumstance
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
desired
only
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
bed
on
bread
and
butter
and
a
little
stewed
fruit
bates
whose
name
was
a
nightmare
to
every
other
man
in
toronto
naturally
had
to
see
a
good
many
of
the
wholesale
people
he
too
complained
of
the
number
of
courses
and
the
variety
of
the
wines
but
only
to
disguise
his
gratification
mcgill
of
the
great
bear
line
had
big
proposals
to
make
in
connection
with
southern
railway
freights
from
liverpool
and
cameron
for
private
reasons
of
magnitude
proposed
to
ascertain
the
real
probability
of
a
duty
to
foreigners
on
certain
forms
of
manufactured
leather
he
turned
out
in
toronto
a
very
good
class
of
suitcase
cruickshank
had
private
connections
to
which
they
were
all
respectful
nobody
but
cruickshank
found
it
expedient
to
look
up
the
lost
leader
of
the
canadian
house
of
commons
contributed
to
a
cause
still
more
completely
lost
in
home
politics
nobody
but
cruickshank
was
likely
to
be
asked
to
dine
by
a
former
of
the
dominion
an
invitation
which
nobody
but
cruickshank
would
be
likely
to
refuse
it
used
to
be
a
command
in
ottawa
said
cruickshank
who
had
got
on
badly
with
his
sovereign
s
representative
there
but
here
it
s
only
a
privilege
there
s
no
business
in
it
and
i
haven
t
time
for
the
nobleman
in
question
had
in
effect
dropped
back
into
the
lords
so
far
as
the
empire
was
concerned
he
was
in
the
impressive
rearguard
and
this
was
a
little
company
of
fighting
men
the
entertainments
arising
out
of
business
were
usually
on
a
scale
more
or
less
sumptuous
they
took
place
in
big
restaurants
and
included
a
look
at
many
of
the
people
who
seem
to
lend
themselves
so
willingly
to
the
great
buzzing
show
that
anybody
can
pay
for
in
london
their
names
in
the
paper
in
the
morning
their
faces
at
prince
s
in
the
evening
their
personalities
no
doubt
advantageously
exposed
in
various
places
during
the
day
but
there
were
others
humbler
ones
in
earl
s
court
road
or
maida
vale
where
the
members
of
the
deputation
had
relatives
whom
it
was
natural
to
hunt
up
long
years
and
many
billows
had
rolled
between
and
more
effective
separations
had
arisen
in
the
whole
difference
of
life
still
it
was
natural
to
hunt
them
up
to
seek
in
their
eyes
and
their
hands
the
old
subtle
bond
of
kin
and
perhaps
such
is
our
vanity
in
the
new
lands
to
show
them
what
the
stock
had
come
to
overseas
they
tended
to
be
depressing
these
visits
the
married
sister
was
living
in
a
small
way
the
first
cousin
seemed
to
have
got
into
a
rut
the
uncle
and
aunt
were
failing
with
a
stooping
trembling
kind
of
decrepitude
a
rigidity
of
body
and
mind
which
somehow
one
didn
t
see
much
over
home
england
said
poulton
the
is
a
dangerous
country
to
live
in
you
run
such
risks
of
growing
they
agreed
i
fear
for
more
reasons
than
this
that
england
was
a
good
country
to
leave
early
and
you
can
not
blame
them
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
did
not
offer
in
his
actual
person
proof
of
what
he
said
their
own
dividing
chance
grew
dramatic
in
their
eyes
i
was
offered
a
clerkship
with
the
cunards
the
day
before
i
sailed
said
mcgill
great
scott
if
i
d
taken
that
clerkship
he
saw
all
his
glorious
past
i
suppose
in
a
suburban
aspect
i
was
kicked
out
said
cameron
and
it
was
the
kindest
attention
my
father
ever
paid
me
and
bates
remarked
that
it
was
worth
coming
out
as
he
did
to
go
back
in
the
best
cabin
in
the
ship
the
appearance
and
opinions
of
those
they
had
left
behind
them
prompted
them
to
this
kind
of
congratulation
with
just
a
thought
of
compunction
at
the
back
of
it
for
their
own
better
fortunes
in
the
further
spectacle
of
england
most
of
them
saw
the
repository
of
singularly
ideas
the
storehouse
of
a
good
deal
of
money
and
the
market
for
unlimited
produce
they
looked
cautiously
at
imperial
sentiment
they
were
full
of
the
terms
of
their
bargain
and
had
as
they
would
have
said
little
use
for
schemes
that
did
not
commend
themselves
on
a
basis
of
common
profit
cruickshank
was
the
biggest
and
the
best
of
them
but
even
cruickshank
submitted
the
common
formulas
submitted
them
and
submitted
to
them
only
lorne
murchison
among
them
looked
higher
and
further
only
he
was
alive
to
the
inrush
of
the
essential
he
only
lifted
up
his
heart
chapter
xvi
lorne
was
thus
an
atom
in
the
surge
of
london
the
members
of
the
deputation
as
their
business
progressed
began
to
feel
less
like
atoms
and
more
like
a
body
exerting
an
influence
however
obscurely
hid
in
a
temperance
hotel
upon
the
tide
of
international
affairs
but
their
secretary
had
naturally
no
initiative
that
appeared
no
importance
that
was
taken
account
of
in
these
respects
no
less
than
in
the
others
he
justified
mr
cruickshank
s
selection
he
did
his
work
as
unobtrusively
as
he
did
it
admirably
well
and
for
the
rest
he
was
just
washed
about
carried
hither
and
thither
generally
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
receptive
absorbent
mostly
silent
he
did
try
once
or
twice
to
talk
to
the
bus
drivers
he
had
been
told
it
was
a
thing
to
do
if
you
wanted
to
get
hold
of
the
point
of
view
of
a
particular
class
but
the
thick
london
idiom
defeated
him
and
he
found
they
grew
surly
when
he
asked
them
too
often
to
repeat
their
replies
he
felt
a
little
surly
himself
after
a
while
when
they
asked
him
as
they
nearly
always
did
if
he
wasn
t
an
american
yes
he
would
say
in
the
end
but
not
the
united
states
kind
resenting
the
necessity
of
explaining
to
the
briton
beside
him
that
there
were
other
kinds
the
imperial
idea
goes
so
quickly
from
the
heart
to
the
head
he
felt
compelled
nevertheless
to
mitigate
his
denial
to
the
bus
drivers
i
expect
it
s
the
next
best
he
would
say
but
it
s
only
the
next
it
was
as
if
he
felt
charged
to
vindicate
the
race
the
whole
of
there
in
his
supreme
moment
his
splendid
position
on
the
top
of
an
omnibus
lumbering
west
out
of
trafalgar
square
one
introduction
of
his
own
he
had
mrs
milburn
had
got
it
for
him
from
the
rector
mr
emmett
to
his
wife
s
brother
mr
charles
chafe
who
had
interests
in
chiswick
and
a
house
in
warwick
gardens
lorne
put
off
presenting
the
letter
did
not
know
indeed
quite
how
to
present
it
till
his
stay
in
london
was
half
over
finally
he
presented
himself
with
it
as
the
quickest
way
at
the
office
of
mr
chafe
s
works
at
chiswick
he
was
cordially
received
both
there
and
in
warwick
gardens
where
he
met
mrs
chafe
and
the
family
when
he
also
met
mr
alfred
hesketh
lorne
went
several
times
to
the
house
in
warwick
gardens
and
hesketh
a
nephew
was
there
on
the
very
first
occasion
it
was
an
encounter
interesting
on
both
sides
he
hesketh
was
a
young
man
with
a
good
public
school
and
a
university
behind
him
where
his
very
moderate
degree
however
failed
to
represent
the
activity
of
his
mind
or
the
capacity
of
his
energy
he
had
a
little
money
of
his
own
and
no
present
occupation
he
belonged
to
the
surplus
he
was
not
content
to
belong
to
it
he
cast
about
him
a
good
deal
for
something
to
do
there
was
always
the
bar
but
only
the
best
fellows
get
on
there
and
he
was
not
quite
one
of
the
best
fellows
he
knew
that
he
had
not
money
enough
for
politics
or
interest
enough
for
the
higher
departments
of
the
public
service
nor
had
he
those
ready
arts
of
expression
that
lead
naturally
into
journalism
anything
involving
further
examinations
he
rejected
on
that
account
and
the
future
of
glassware
in
view
of
what
they
were
doing
in
germany
did
not
entice
him
to
join
his
uncle
in
chiswick
still
he
was
aware
of
enterprise
convinced
that
he
had
loafed
long
enough
lorne
murchison
had
never
met
anyone
of
hesketh
s
age
in
hesketh
s
condition
before
affluence
and
age
he
knew
in
honourable
retirement
poverty
and
youth
he
knew
embarked
in
the
struggle
indolence
and
youth
he
also
knew
as
it
cumbered
the
ground
but
youth
and
a
competence
equipped
with
education
industry
and
vigour
searching
vainly
in
fields
empty
of
opportunity
was
to
him
a
new
spectacle
he
himself
had
intended
to
be
a
lawyer
since
he
was
fourteen
there
never
had
been
any
impediment
to
his
intention
any
qualification
to
his
desire
he
was
still
under
his
father
s
roof
but
that
was
for
the
general
happiness
any
time
within
the
last
eighteen
months
if
he
had
chosen
to
hurry
fate
he
might
have
selected
another
he
was
younger
than
hesketh
by
a
year
yet
we
may
say
that
he
had
arrived
while
hesketh
was
still
fidgeting
at
the
why
don
t
you
farm
he
asked
once
farming
in
england
may
pay
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
not
before
i
can
t
wait
for
it
besides
why
should
i
farm
why
didn
t
you
well
said
lorne
in
your
case
it
seems
about
the
only
thing
left
i
oh
it
doesn
t
attract
us
over
there
we
re
getting
away
from
it
leaving
it
to
the
newcomers
from
this
side
curious
circle
that
i
wonder
when
our
place
gets
overcrowded
where
we
shall
go
to
plough
hesketh
s
situation
occupied
them
a
good
deal
but
their
great
topic
had
a
wider
drift
embracing
nothing
less
than
the
empire
pausing
nowhere
short
of
the
flag
the
imperial
idea
was
very
much
at
the
moment
in
the
public
mind
it
hung
heavily
like
a
banner
in
every
newspaper
it
was
filtering
through
the
slow
british
consciousness
solidifying
as
it
travelled
in
the
end
it
might
be
expected
to
arrive
at
a
shape
in
which
the
british
consciousness
must
either
assimilate
it
or
cast
it
forth
they
were
saying
in
the
suburbs
that
they
wanted
it
explained
at
hatfield
they
were
saying
some
of
them
with
folded
arms
that
it
was
self
evident
other
members
of
that
great
house
swinging
their
arms
called
it
blackness
of
darkness
and
ruin
so
had
a
prophet
divided
it
against
itself
wallingham
still
in
the
cabinet
was
going
up
and
down
the
country
trying
not
to
explain
too
much
there
was
division
in
the
cabinet
sore
travail
among
private
members
the
conception
being
ministerial
the
opposition
applied
itself
to
the
task
of
abortion
fearing
the
worst
if
it
should
be
presented
to
the
country
fully
formed
and
featured
the
smiling
offspring
of
progress
and
imagination
travellers
to
greater
britain
returned
waving
joyous
torches
in
the
insular
fog
they
shed
a
brilliance
and
infectious
enthusiasm
but
there
were
not
enough
to
do
more
than
make
the
fog
visible
many
persons
found
such
torches
irritating
they
pointed
out
that
as
england
had
groped
to
her
present
greatness
she
might
be
trusted
to
feel
her
way
further
free
trade
they
said
has
made
us
what
we
are
put
out
these
lights
mr
chafe
was
one
of
these
he
was
a
cautious
heavy
fellow
full
of
burgundy
and
distrust
the
basis
of
the
imperial
idea
inspired
him
with
suspicion
and
hostility
he
could
accept
the
american
tariff
on
english
manufactures
that
was
a
plain
position
simple
damage
a
blow
full
in
the
face
not
to
be
dodged
but
the
offer
of
better
business
in
the
english
colonies
in
exchange
for
a
duty
on
the
corn
and
meat
of
foreign
countries
he
could
see
too
deep
for
that
the
colonials
might
or
might
not
be
good
customers
he
knew
how
many
decanters
he
sold
in
the
united
states
in
spite
of
the
tariff
he
saw
that
the
tax
on
was
being
commended
to
the
with
the
argument
of
higher
wages
higher
wages
with
the
competition
of
foreign
labour
spelt
only
one
word
to
english
manufacturers
and
that
was
ruin
the
bugbear
of
higher
wages
immediate
threatening
near
the
terror
of
the
last
thirty
years
closed
the
prospect
for
charles
chafe
he
could
see
nothing
beyond
he
did
not
say
so
but
to
him
the
prosperity
of
the
british
manufacturer
was
bound
up
in
the
indigence
of
the
operative
thriving
workmen
doing
well
and
looking
to
do
better
rose
before
him
in
terms
of
menace
though
their
prosperity
might
be
rooted
in
his
own
give
them
cheap
food
and
keep
them
poor
was
the
sum
of
his
advice
his
opinions
had
the
emphasis
of
the
unexpected
the
unnatural
he
was
one
of
the
people
whom
wallingham
s
scheme
in
its
legitimate
development
of
a
tariff
on
foreign
manufactures
might
be
expected
to
enrich
this
fact
which
he
constantly
insisted
on
did
give
them
weight
it
made
him
look
like
a
cunning
fellow
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
he
and
his
business
had
survived
free
trade
though
he
would
not
say
this
either
and
he
preferred
to
go
on
surviving
it
rather
than
take
the
chances
of
any
zollverein
the
name
of
the
thing
was
enough
for
him
a
word
made
in
germany
thick
and
mucky
like
their
tumblers
as
to
the
colonies
mr
chafe
had
been
told
of
a
certain
spider
who
devoured
her
young
ones
he
reversed
the
figure
and
it
stood
in
the
imperial
connection
for
all
the
argument
he
wanted
alfred
hesketh
had
lived
always
in
the
hearing
of
such
doctrine
it
had
stood
to
him
for
political
gospel
by
mere
force
of
repetition
but
he
was
young
with
the
curiosity
and
enterprise
and
impatience
of
dogma
of
youth
he
belonged
by
temperament
and
situation
to
those
plastic
thousands
in
whom
wallingham
hoped
to
find
the
leaven
that
should
leaven
the
whole
lump
his
own
blood
stirred
with
the
desire
to
accomplish
to
carry
further
and
as
the
scope
of
the
philanthropist
did
not
attract
him
he
was
vaguely
conscious
of
having
been
born
too
late
in
england
the
new
political
appeal
of
the
colonies
clashing
suddenly
upon
old
insular
harmonies
brought
him
a
sense
of
wider
fields
and
chances
his
own
case
he
freely
translated
into
his
country
s
and
offered
an
open
mind
to
politics
that
would
help
either
of
them
he
looked
at
the
new
countries
with
interest
an
interest
evoked
by
their
sudden
dramatic
leap
into
the
forefront
of
public
concern
he
looked
at
them
with
what
nature
intended
to
be
the
eye
of
a
practical
businessman
he
looked
at
lorne
murchison
too
and
listened
to
him
with
steady
critical
attention
lorne
seemed
in
a
way
to
sum
it
all
up
in
his
person
all
the
better
opportunity
a
man
had
out
there
and
he
handled
large
matters
of
the
future
with
a
confidence
and
a
grip
that
quickened
the
circulation
hesketh
s
open
mind
gradually
became
filled
with
the
imperial
view
as
he
had
the
capacity
to
take
it
and
we
need
not
be
surprised
if
lorne
murchison
gazing
in
the
same
direction
supposed
that
they
saw
the
same
thing
hesketh
confessed
declared
that
murchison
had
brought
him
round
and
lorne
surveyed
this
achievement
with
a
thrill
of
the
happiest
triumph
hesketh
stood
to
him
a
product
of
that
best
which
he
was
so
occupied
in
admiring
and
pursuing
perhaps
he
more
properly
represented
the
second
best
but
we
must
allow
something
for
the
confusion
of
early
impressions
hesketh
had
lived
always
in
the
presence
of
ideals
disengaged
in
england
as
nowhere
else
in
the
world
in
oxford
lorne
knew
they
clustered
thick
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
manners
were
good
and
his
ideas
unimpeachable
in
the
letter
the
young
canadian
read
the
rest
into
him
and
loved
him
for
what
he
might
have
been
as
an
englishman
said
hesketh
one
evening
as
they
walked
together
back
from
the
chafes
along
knightsbridge
talking
of
the
policy
urged
by
the
colonial
representatives
at
the
last
conference
i
could
wish
the
idea
were
more
our
own
that
we
were
pressing
it
on
the
colonies
instead
of
the
colonies
pressing
it
on
doesn
t
there
come
a
time
in
the
history
of
most
families
lorne
replied
when
the
old
folks
look
to
the
sons
and
daughters
to
keep
them
in
touch
with
the
times
why
shouldn
t
a
vigorous
policy
of
empire
be
conceived
by
its
younger
nations
who
have
the
ultimate
resources
to
carry
it
out
we
ve
got
them
and
we
know
it
the
iron
and
the
coal
and
the
gold
and
the
areas
i
dare
say
it
makes
us
seem
cheeky
but
i
tell
you
the
last
argument
lies
in
the
soil
and
what
you
can
get
out
of
it
what
has
this
country
got
in
comparison
a
market
of
forty
million
people
whom
she
can
t
feed
and
is
less
and
less
able
to
find
work
for
do
you
call
that
a
resource
i
call
it
an
impediment
a
penalty
it
s
something
to
exploit
for
the
immediate
profit
in
it
something
to
bargain
with
but
even
as
a
market
it
can
t
preponderate
always
and
i
can
t
see
why
it
should
make
such
tremendous
england
isn
t
superannuated
yet
not
yet
please
god
she
never
will
be
but
she
isn
t
as
young
as
she
was
and
it
does
seem
to
me
what
seems
to
you
well
i
m
no
economist
and
i
don
t
know
how
far
to
trust
my
impressions
and
you
needn
t
tell
me
i
m
a
rank
outsider
for
i
know
that
but
coming
here
as
an
outsider
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
s
from
the
outside
that
any
sort
of
helpful
change
in
the
conditions
of
this
country
has
got
to
come
england
still
has
military
initiative
though
it
s
hard
to
see
how
she
s
going
to
keep
that
unless
she
does
something
to
stop
the
degeneration
of
the
class
she
draws
her
army
from
but
what
other
kind
do
we
hear
about
for
ladies
the
opening
of
a
new
oriental
in
regent
street
with
between
four
and
six
and
japanese
attendants
who
take
the
change
on
their
hands
and
knees
london
s
one
great
stomach
how
many
eating
places
have
we
passed
in
the
last
ten
minutes
the
place
seems
all
taken
up
with
inventing
new
ways
of
making
rich
people
more
comfortable
and
i
m
fed
up
with
the
sight
of
shiny
carriages
with
cockaded
flunkeys
on
em
rolling
about
with
an
elderly
woman
and
a
parasol
and
a
dog
england
seems
to
have
fallen
back
on
itself
got
content
to
spend
the
money
there
is
in
the
country
already
and
about
the
only
line
of
commercial
activity
the
stranger
sees
is
the
onslaught
on
that
accumulation
london
isn
t
the
headquarters
for
big
new
developing
enterprises
any
more
if
you
take
out
westminster
and
wallingham
london
is
a
collection
of
traditions
and
great
houses
and
newspaper
offices
and
shops
that
sort
of
thing
can
t
go
on
for
ever
already
capital
is
drawing
away
to
conditions
it
can
find
a
profit
in
steel
works
in
canada
woollen
factories
in
australia
jute
mills
in
india
do
you
know
where
the
boots
came
from
that
shod
the
troops
in
south
africa
cawnpore
the
money
will
go
you
know
and
that
s
a
fact
the
money
will
go
and
the
people
will
go
anyhow
it
s
only
a
case
of
whether
england
sends
them
with
blessing
and
profit
and
greater
glory
or
whether
she
lets
them
slip
away
in
spite
of
i
dare
say
it
will
replied
hesketh
i
ve
got
precious
little
but
what
there
is
i
d
take
out
fast
enough
if
i
saw
a
decent
chance
of
investing
it
i
sometimes
think
of
trying
my
luck
in
the
states
two
or
three
fellows
in
my
year
went
over
there
and
aren
t
making
half
a
bad
thing
of
oh
come
said
lorne
round
upon
the
other
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
it
isn
t
exactly
the
time
is
it
to
talk
about
chucking
the
empire
well
no
it
isn
t
hesketh
admitted
one
might
do
better
to
wait
i
dare
say
at
all
events
till
we
see
what
the
country
says
to
they
walked
on
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
then
lorne
broke
out
again
i
suppose
it
s
unreasonable
but
there
s
nothing
i
hate
so
much
as
to
hear
englishmen
talk
of
settling
in
the
united
it
s
risky
i
admit
and
i
ve
never
heard
anybody
yet
say
it
was
in
a
few
years
fifty
maybe
it
won
t
matter
things
will
have
taken
their
direction
by
then
but
now
it
s
a
question
of
the
lead
the
americans
think
they
ve
got
it
and
unless
we
get
imperial
federation
of
course
they
have
it
s
their
plain
intention
to
capture
england
we
re
a
long
way
from
that
said
hesketh
yes
but
it
s
in
the
line
of
fate
industrial
energy
is
deserting
this
country
and
you
have
no
large
movement
no
to
make
against
the
increasing
forces
that
are
driving
this
way
from
over
there
nothing
to
oppose
to
assault
england
is
in
a
state
of
siege
and
doesn
t
seem
to
know
it
she
s
so
great
hesketh
it
s
pathetic
she
offers
an
undefended
shore
to
attack
and
a
stupid
confidence
a
kindly
blindness
above
all
to
americans
whom
she
patronizes
in
the
i
believe
we
do
patronize
them
said
hesketh
it
s
rotten
bad
oh
form
i
may
be
mad
but
one
seems
to
see
in
politics
over
here
a
lack
of
definition
and
purpose
a
tendency
to
cling
to
the
abstract
and
to
precedent
the
mainstay
of
the
mandarin
one
of
the
papers
calls
it
that
s
a
good
word
that
give
one
the
feeling
that
this
kingdom
is
beginning
to
be
aware
of
some
influence
stronger
than
its
own
it
lies
of
course
in
the
great
west
where
the
corn
and
the
cattle
grow
and
between
winnipeg
and
chicago
choose
quickly
england
his
companion
laughed
oh
i
m
with
you
he
said
but
you
take
a
pessimistic
view
of
this
country
it
depends
on
what
you
call
pessimism
lorne
rejoined
i
see
england
down
the
future
the
heart
of
the
empire
the
conscience
of
the
world
and
the
mecca
of
the
chapter
xvii
the
cruickshank
deputation
returned
across
that
north
atlantic
which
it
was
their
desire
to
see
so
much
more
than
ever
the
track
of
the
flag
toward
the
middle
of
july
the
shiny
carriages
were
still
rolling
about
in
great
numbers
when
they
left
london
s
air
of
luxury
had
thickened
with
the
advancing
season
and
hung
heavily
in
the
streets
people
had
begun
to
picnic
in
the
park
on
sundays
they
had
been
from
the
beginning
a
source
of
wonder
and
of
depression
to
lorne
murchison
the
people
in
the
park
those
i
mean
who
walked
and
sat
and
stood
there
for
the
refreshment
of
their
lives
for
whom
the
place
has
a
lyrical
value
as
real
as
it
is
unconscious
he
noted
them
ranged
on
formal
benches
quiet
respectable
absorptive
or
gathered
heavily
shoulder
to
shoulder
docile
under
the
tutelage
of
policemen
listening
to
anyone
who
would
lift
a
voice
to
speak
to
them
london
beating
on
all
borders
hemmed
them
in
england
outside
seemed
hardly
to
contain
for
them
a
wider
space
lorne
with
his
soul
full
of
free
airs
and
forest
depths
never
failed
to
respond
to
a
note
in
the
park
that
left
him
longing
for
an
automatic
distributing
system
for
the
empire
when
he
saw
them
bring
their
and
kettles
and
sit
down
in
little
companies
on
four
square
yards
of
turf
under
the
blackened
branches
in
the
roar
of
the
traffic
he
went
back
to
bloomsbury
to
pack
his
trunk
glad
that
it
was
not
his
lot
to
live
with
that
enduring
spectacle
they
were
all
glad
every
one
of
them
to
turn
their
faces
to
the
west
again
the
unready
conception
of
things
the
political
concentration
upon
parish
affairs
the
cumbrous
social
machinery
oppressed
them
with
its
dull
anachronism
in
a
marching
world
the
problems
of
sluggish
overpopulation
clouded
their
eager
outlook
these
conditions
might
have
been
their
inheritance
perhaps
lorne
murchison
was
the
only
one
who
thanked
heaven
consciously
that
it
was
not
so
but
there
was
no
man
among
them
whose
pulse
did
not
mark
a
heart
rejoiced
as
he
paced
the
deck
of
the
allan
liner
the
first
morning
out
of
liverpool
because
he
had
leave
to
refuse
them
none
dreamed
of
staying
of
settling
though
such
a
course
was
practicable
to
any
of
them
except
lorne
they
were
all
rich
enough
to
take
the
advantages
that
money
brings
in
england
the
comfort
the
importance
the
state
they
had
only
to
add
their
wealth
to
the
sumptuous
side
of
the
dramatic
contrast
i
doubt
whether
the
idea
even
presented
itself
it
is
the
american
who
takes
up
his
appreciative
residence
in
england
he
comes
as
a
foreigner
observant
amused
having
disclaimed
responsibility
for
a
hundred
years
his
detachment
is
as
complete
as
it
would
be
in
italy
with
the
added
pleasure
of
easy
comprehension
but
homecomers
from
greater
britain
have
never
been
cut
off
still
feel
their
uneasy
share
in
all
that
is
and
draw
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
they
turn
again
to
their
life
in
the
lands
where
they
found
wider
scope
and
different
opportunities
and
that
new
quality
in
the
blood
which
made
them
different
men
the
deputation
had
accomplished
a
good
deal
less
cruickshank
said
than
he
had
hoped
but
more
than
he
had
expected
they
had
obtained
the
promise
of
concessions
for
atlantic
services
both
mail
and
certain
classes
of
freight
by
being
able
to
demonstrate
a
generous
policy
on
their
own
side
pacific
communications
the
home
government
was
more
chary
of
there
were
matters
to
be
fought
out
with
australia
the
pacific
was
further
away
as
cruickshank
said
and
you
naturally
can
t
get
fellows
who
have
never
been
there
to
see
the
country
under
the
selkirks
and
south
of
the
bay
any
of
them
except
wallingham
who
had
never
been
there
either
but
whose
imagination
took
views
of
the
falcon
they
were
reinforced
by
news
of
a
shipping
combination
in
montreal
to
lower
freights
to
south
africa
against
the
americans
it
wasn
t
news
to
them
some
of
them
were
in
it
but
it
was
to
the
public
and
it
helped
the
sentiment
of
their
aim
the
feather
on
the
arrow
they
had
secured
something
both
financially
and
morally
what
best
pleased
them
perhaps
was
the
extent
to
which
they
got
their
scheme
discussed
here
lorne
had
been
invaluable
murchison
had
done
more
with
the
newspapers
they
agreed
than
any
of
them
with
cabinet
ministers
the
journalist
everywhere
is
perhaps
more
accessible
to
ideas
more
susceptible
to
enthusiasm
than
his
fellows
and
lorne
was
charged
with
the
object
of
his
deputation
in
its
most
communicable
most
captivating
form
at
all
events
he
came
to
excellent
understanding
whether
of
agreement
or
opposition
with
the
newspapermen
he
met
cruickshank
knew
a
good
many
of
them
and
these
occasions
were
more
fruitful
than
the
official
ones
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
guarded
approval
of
certain
leading
columns
had
fewer
ifs
and
buts
and
other
qualifications
in
consequence
while
the
disapproval
of
others
was
marked
by
a
kind
of
unwilling
sympathy
and
a
freely
accorded
respect
lorne
found
london
editors
surprisingly
unbiased
london
newspapers
surprisingly
untrammelled
they
seemed
to
him
to
suffer
from
no
dictated
views
no
interests
in
the
background
or
special
local
circumstances
they
had
open
minds
most
of
them
and
when
a
cloud
appeared
it
was
seldom
more
than
a
prejudice
it
was
only
his
impression
and
perhaps
it
would
not
stand
cynical
inquiry
but
he
had
a
grateful
conviction
that
the
english
press
occupied
in
the
main
a
lofty
and
impartial
ground
of
opinion
from
which
it
desired
only
a
view
of
the
facts
in
their
true
proportion
on
his
return
he
confided
it
to
horace
williams
who
scoffed
and
ran
the
national
politics
of
the
express
in
the
local
interests
of
fox
county
as
hard
as
ever
but
it
had
fallen
in
with
lorne
s
beautiful
beliefs
about
england
and
he
clung
to
it
for
years
the
williamses
had
come
over
the
second
evening
following
lorne
s
arrival
after
tea
rawlins
had
gone
to
the
station
just
to
see
that
the
express
would
make
no
mistake
in
announcing
that
mr
murchison
had
returned
to
the
paternal
roof
and
the
express
had
announced
it
with
due
congratulation
family
feeling
demanded
that
for
the
first
hours
he
should
be
left
to
his
immediate
circle
but
people
had
been
dropping
in
all
the
next
day
at
the
office
and
now
came
the
williamses
trapesing
as
mrs
murchison
said
across
the
grass
though
she
was
too
content
to
make
it
more
than
a
private
grievance
to
where
they
all
sat
on
the
verandah
what
i
don
t
understand
horace
williams
said
to
mr
murchison
was
why
you
didn
t
give
him
a
blow
on
the
whistle
you
and
milburn
and
a
few
others
might
have
got
up
quite
a
toot
you
don
t
get
the
secretary
to
a
deputation
for
tying
up
the
empire
home
every
you
did
that
for
him
in
the
express
said
john
murchison
smiling
as
he
pressed
down
with
an
accustomed
thumb
the
tobacco
into
his
pipe
oh
we
said
nothing
at
all
wait
till
he
s
returned
for
south
fox
williams
responded
jocularly
why
not
the
imperial
council
of
the
future
at
westminster
while
you
re
about
it
remarked
lorne
flipping
a
pebble
back
upon
the
gravel
path
that
will
keep
my
son
but
one
of
these
days
you
mark
my
words
mr
murchison
will
travel
to
elgin
station
with
flags
on
his
engine
and
he
ll
be
very
much
surprised
to
find
the
band
there
and
a
large
number
of
his
all
shouting
men
and
every
factory
whistle
in
elgin
let
off
at
once
to
say
nothing
of
kids
with
tin
ones
and
if
the
murchison
stove
and
furnace
works
siren
stands
out
of
that
occasion
i
ll
break
in
and
pull
it
it
won
t
stand
out
stella
assured
him
i
ll
attend
to
it
don
t
you
i
suppose
you
had
a
lovely
time
mr
murchison
said
mrs
williams
gently
tilting
to
and
fro
in
a
with
her
pretty
feet
in
their
american
shoes
well
in
evidence
it
is
a
fact
or
perhaps
a
parable
that
should
be
interesting
to
political
economists
the
adaptability
of
canadian
feet
to
american
shoes
but
fortunately
it
is
not
our
present
business
though
i
must
add
that
the
rocker
was
also
american
and
the
hammock
in
which
stella
reposed
came
from
new
york
and
upon
john
murchison
s
knee
with
the
local
journal
lay
a
pink
evening
paper
published
in
buffalo
better
than
i
can
tell
you
mrs
williams
in
all
sorts
of
ways
but
it
s
good
to
be
back
too
very
good
lorne
threw
up
his
head
and
drew
in
the
pleasant
evening
air
of
midsummer
with
infinite
relish
while
his
eye
travelled
contentedly
past
the
chestnuts
on
the
lawn
down
the
vista
of
the
quiet
street
it
lay
empty
in
the
solace
of
the
evening
a
blue
hill
crossed
it
in
the
distance
and
gave
it
an
unfettered
look
the
wind
stirred
in
the
maples
a
pair
of
schoolgirls
strolled
up
and
down
bareheaded
now
and
then
a
buggy
passed
there
s
room
here
he
said
find
it
kind
of
crowded
up
over
there
asked
mr
williams
worse
than
new
york
oh
yes
crowded
in
a
patient
sort
of
way
it
s
enough
to
break
your
heart
that
you
don
t
see
in
new
york
the
poor
of
new
york
well
they
ve
got
the
idea
of
not
being
poor
in
england
they
re
resigned
they
ve
got
callous
my
goodness
the
fellows
out
of
work
over
there
you
can
see
they
re
used
to
it
see
it
in
the
way
they
slope
along
and
the
look
in
their
eyes
poor
dumb
dogs
they
don
t
understand
it
but
they
ve
just
got
to
take
it
crowded
rather
we
don
t
say
rather
in
this
country
mister
observed
stella
well
you
can
say
it
now
they
laughed
at
the
little
passage
the
traveller
s
importation
of
one
or
two
britishisms
had
been
the
subject
of
skirmish
before
but
silence
fell
among
them
for
a
moment
afterward
they
all
had
in
the
blood
the
remembrance
of
what
lorne
had
seen
well
you
ve
been
doing
big
business
said
horace
williams
lorne
shook
his
head
we
haven
t
done
any
harm
he
said
but
our
scheme
s
away
out
of
sight
now
at
least
it
ought
to
lost
in
the
bigger
said
williams
and
lorne
nodded
the
bigger
issue
had
indeed
in
the
meantime
obscured
the
political
horizon
and
was
widely
spreading
a
mere
colonial
project
might
well
disappear
in
it
england
was
absorbed
in
a
single
contemplation
wallingham
though
he
still
supported
the
disabilities
of
a
right
honourable
evangelist
with
a
gospel
of
his
own
was
making
astonishing
conversions
the
edifice
of
the
national
economic
creed
seemed
coming
over
at
the
top
it
was
a
question
of
the
resistance
of
the
base
and
the
world
was
watching
cruickshank
says
if
the
main
question
had
been
sprung
a
month
ago
we
wouldn
t
have
gone
over
as
it
is
on
several
points
we
ve
got
to
wait
if
they
reject
the
preferential
trade
idea
over
there
we
shall
have
done
a
little
good
for
any
government
would
be
disposed
to
try
to
patch
up
something
to
take
the
place
of
imperial
union
in
that
case
and
a
few
thousands
more
for
shipping
subsidies
and
cheap
cablegrams
would
have
a
great
look
of
strengthening
the
ties
with
the
colonies
but
if
they
commit
themselves
to
a
zollverein
with
us
and
the
rest
of
the
family
you
won
t
hear
much
more
about
the
need
to
foster
communications
communications
will
foster
just
so
remarked
john
murchison
they
ll
save
their
i
wouldn
t
think
so
before
i
couldn
t
lorne
went
on
but
i
m
afraid
it
s
rather
futile
the
kind
of
thing
we
ve
been
trying
to
do
it
s
fiddling
at
a
superstructure
without
a
foundation
what
we
want
is
the
common
interest
common
interest
common
taxation
for
defence
common
representation
domestic
management
of
domestic
affairs
and
you
ve
got
a
working
just
as
easy
as
slippin
off
a
log
remarked
horace
williams
common
interest
yes
said
his
father
common
taxation
no
for
defence
or
any
other
purpose
the
colonies
will
never
send
money
to
be
squandered
by
the
london
war
office
we
ll
defend
ourselves
as
soon
as
we
can
manage
it
and
buy
our
own
guns
and
our
own
cruisers
we
re
better
business
people
than
they
are
and
we
know
i
guess
that
s
right
mr
murchison
said
horace
williams
our
own
army
and
navy
in
the
sweet
and
let
em
understand
they
ll
be
welcome
to
the
use
of
it
but
quite
in
a
family
way
no
sort
of
well
said
lorne
that
s
compatible
and
your
domestic
affairs
must
include
the
tariff
mr
murchison
went
on
there
s
no
such
possibility
as
a
tariff
that
will
go
round
and
tariffs
are
kittle
cattle
to
shoo
has
anybody
got
a
scotch
dictionary
inquired
stella
this
conversation
is
making
me
suppose
you
run
away
and
play
with
your
hoop
suggested
her
brother
i
can
t
see
that
as
an
insuperable
difficulty
father
tariffs
could
be
made
adaptable
relative
to
the
common
interest
as
well
as
to
the
individual
one
we
could
do
it
if
we
your
adaptability
might
easily
lead
to
other
things
what
s
to
prevent
retaliation
among
ourselves
there
s
a
slump
in
textiles
and
the
home
government
is
forced
to
let
in
foreign
wool
cheaper
up
goes
the
australian
tax
on
the
output
of
every
mill
in
lancashire
the
last
state
of
the
empire
might
be
worse
than
the
it
wouldn
t
be
serious
if
i
pinched
stella
s
leg
as
i
m
going
to
in
a
minute
she
will
no
doubt
kick
me
and
her
instincts
are
such
that
she
will
probably
kick
me
with
the
leg
i
pinched
but
that
won
t
prevent
our
going
to
the
football
match
together
tomorrow
and
presenting
a
united
front
to
the
they
all
laughed
and
stella
pulled
down
her
lengthening
petticoats
with
an
air
of
great
offence
but
john
murchison
shook
his
head
if
they
manage
it
they
will
be
clever
he
said
talking
of
lancashire
said
williams
there
are
some
funny
fellows
over
there
writing
in
the
press
against
a
tax
on
foreign
cotton
because
it
s
going
to
ruin
lancashire
and
at
this
very
minute
thousands
of
looms
are
shut
down
in
lancashire
because
of
the
high
price
of
cotton
produced
by
an
american
combine
and
worse
coming
sevenpence
a
pound
i
hear
they
re
going
to
have
it
against
the
fourpence
ha
penny
they
ve
got
it
up
to
already
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
they
re
afraid
to
discourage
by
a
would
a
duty
discourage
it
asked
john
murchison
why
not
if
they
let
cotton
in
free
they
won
t
discourage
the
combine
much
that
form
of
enterprise
has
got
to
be
tackled
where
it
grows
but
the
yankee
isn
t
the
only
person
in
the
world
that
can
get
to
understand
it
what
s
to
prevent
preferential
conditions
creating
british
combines
to
compete
with
the
american
article
and
what
s
to
prevent
lancashire
getting
cheaper
cotton
in
consequence
two
combines
are
better
than
one
monopoly
any
may
be
so
it
would
want
looking
into
we
won
t
see
a
duty
on
cotton
though
or
wool
either
for
that
matter
the
manufacturers
would
be
pleased
enough
to
get
it
on
the
stuff
they
make
but
there
would
be
a
fine
outcry
against
taxing
the
stuff
they
did
you
see
much
of
the
aristocracy
mr
murchison
asked
mrs
williams
no
replied
lorne
but
i
saw
you
saw
the
whole
house
of
lords
interposed
stella
and
you
were
introduced
to
well
yes
that
s
so
set
of
old
chaps
they
are
too
we
re
a
little
too
funny
over
here
about
the
lords
we
haven
t
had
to
make
what
were
they
doing
the
day
you
were
there
lorne
asked
williams
motorcar
legislation
replied
lorne
considerably
excited
about
it
too
one
of
them
had
had
three
dogs
killed
on
his
estate
i
saw
his
letter
about
it
in
the
i
don
t
see
anything
to
laugh
at
in
that
declared
stella
dogs
are
they
are
sister
especially
in
laundresses
aren
t
washerwomen
there
observed
mrs
murchison
i
d
like
you
to
see
the
colour
of
the
things
he
s
brought
home
with
him
mrs
williams
clean
or
dirty
to
the
laundry
they
go
weeks
it
will
take
to
get
them
right
again
ingrained
london
smut
and
nothing
in
this
preference
business
they
ve
got
to
lead
the
way
williams
reverted
we
re
not
so
grown
up
but
what
grandma
s
got
to
march
in
front
now
from
your
exhaustive
observation
of
great
britain
extending
over
a
period
of
six
weeks
is
she
going
to
my
exhaustive
observation
said
lorne
smiling
enables
me
to
tell
you
one
thing
with
absolute
accuracy
and
that
is
that
nobody
knows
they
adore
wallingham
over
there
he
s
pretty
nearly
a
god
and
they
d
like
to
do
as
he
tells
them
and
they
re
dead
sick
of
theoretic
politics
but
they
re
afraid
oh
they
re
afraid
they
ll
do
well
to
ca
canny
said
john
murchison
there
s
two
things
in
the
way
at
a
glance
lorne
went
on
the
conservatism
of
the
people
it
isn
t
a
name
it
s
a
fact
the
hostility
and
suspicion
natural
enough
they
know
they
re
stupid
and
they
half
suspect
they
re
fair
game
i
suppose
the
americans
have
taught
them
that
slow
oh
slow
more
interested
in
the
fence
than
anything
else
pick
up
a
paper
at
the
moment
when
things
are
being
done
mind
all
over
the
world
done
against
them
when
their
shipping
is
being
captured
and
their
industries
destroyed
and
their
goods
undersold
beneath
their
very
noses
and
the
thing
they
want
to
know
is
why
are
the
swallows
late
i
read
it
myself
in
a
ha
penny
morning
paper
too
that
they
think
rather
dangerously
a
whole
column
headed
to
inquire
what
s
the
matter
with
the
swallows
the
times
the
same
week
had
a
useful
leader
on
alterations
in
the
church
service
and
a
special
contribution
on
prayers
for
the
dead
lord
they
need
em
those
are
the
things
they
think
about
the
session
s
nearly
over
and
there
s
two
church
discipline
bills
and
five
church
bills
bishoprics
and
benefices
and
lord
knows
what
still
to
get
through
lot
of
anxiety
about
em
apparently
as
to
a
business
view
of
politics
i
expect
the
climate
s
against
it
they
ll
see
over
a
thing
they
re
fond
of
doing
that
or
under
it
or
round
one
side
of
it
but
they
don
t
seem
to
have
any
way
of
seeing
through
it
what
they
just
love
is
a
good
round
catchword
they
ve
only
got
to
hear
themselves
say
it
often
enough
and
they
ll
take
it
for
gospel
they
re
convinced
out
of
their
own
mouths
there
was
the
driver
of
a
bus
i
used
to
ride
on
pretty
often
and
if
he
felt
like
talking
he
d
always
begin
as
i
was
of
yesterday
well
that
s
the
general
idea
to
repeat
what
they
were
of
yesterday
and
it
doesn
t
matter
two
cents
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
changed
the
subject
they
ve
been
a
long
time
that
they
object
to
import
duties
of
any
sort
or
kind
and
you
won
t
get
them
to
see
the
business
in
changing
if
they
do
this
it
won
t
be
because
they
want
to
it
will
be
because
wallingham
wants
them
i
guess
that
s
so
said
williams
and
if
wallingham
gets
them
to
he
ought
to
have
a
statue
in
every
capital
in
the
empire
he
will
too
good
cigar
this
lorne
where
d
you
get
it
they
are
indian
cheroots
planters
they
call
em
made
in
madras
i
got
some
through
a
man
named
hesketh
who
has
friends
out
there
at
a
price
you
wouldn
t
believe
for
as
decent
a
smoke
you
can
t
buy
em
in
london
but
you
will
all
right
and
here
too
as
soon
as
we
ve
got
the
sense
to
favour
lorne
appreciates
his
family
better
than
he
did
before
remarked
his
youngest
sister
because
we
re
british
you
were
saying
you
noticed
two
things
specially
in
the
way
said
his
father
oh
the
other
s
of
course
the
awful
poverty
the
twelve
millions
that
haven
t
got
enough
to
do
with
i
expect
it
s
an
outside
figure
and
it
covers
all
sorts
of
qualifying
circumstances
but
it
s
the
one
the
free
fooders
quote
and
it
s
the
one
wallingham
will
have
to
handle
they
ve
muddled
along
until
they
ve
got
twelve
million
people
in
that
condition
and
now
they
have
to
carry
on
with
the
handicap
we
ask
them
to
put
a
tax
on
foreign
food
to
develop
our
wheat
areas
and
cattle
ranges
we
say
give
us
a
chance
and
we
ll
feed
you
and
take
your
surplus
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
twelve
million
while
we
are
growing
the
wheat
the
colonies
offer
to
create
prosperity
for
everybody
concerned
at
a
certain
outlay
we
ve
got
the
raw
materials
and
they
can
t
afford
the
investment
because
of
the
twelve
millions
and
what
may
happen
meanwhile
they
can
t
face
the
meanwhile
that
s
what
it
comes
fine
old
crop
of
catchwords
in
that
situation
mr
williams
remarked
and
his
eye
had
the
spark
of
the
practical
politician
can
t
you
hear
em
at
it
eh
it
scares
them
out
of
everything
but
politics
any
other
remedy
is
too
heroic
they
go
on
pointing
out
and
contemplating
and
grieving
with
their
percentages
of
misery
and
degeneration
and
they
go
on
poulticing
the
cancer
with
benevolence
there
are
people
over
there
who
want
the
state
to
feed
the
schoolchildren
oh
they
re
kind
good
people
and
they
ve
got
the
idea
that
if
they
can
only
give
enough
away
everything
will
come
right
i
was
talking
with
a
man
one
day
and
i
asked
him
whether
the
existence
of
any
class
justified
governing
a
great
country
on
the
principle
of
an
almshouse
he
asked
me
who
the
almsgivers
ought
to
be
in
any
country
of
course
it
was
tampering
with
my
figure
in
an
almshouse
there
aren
t
any
but
that
s
the
way
it
presents
itself
to
the
best
of
them
another
fellow
was
frantic
at
the
idea
of
a
tax
on
foreign
food
he
nearly
cried
but
would
be
very
glad
to
see
the
government
do
more
to
assist
emigration
to
the
colonies
i
tried
to
show
him
it
would
be
better
to
make
it
profitable
to
emigrate
first
but
i
couldn
t
make
him
see
it
oh
and
there
s
the
old
thing
against
them
of
course
the
handling
of
imperial
and
local
affairs
by
one
body
anybody
s
good
enough
to
attend
to
the
baghdad
railway
and
nobody
s
too
good
to
attend
to
the
town
pump
is
it
any
wonder
the
germans
beat
them
in
their
own
shops
and
russia
walks
into
thibet
the
eternal
marvel
is
that
they
stand
where
they
at
the
top
said
mr
williams
oh
at
the
top
think
of
what
you
mean
when
you
say
i
see
that
the
demand
for
a
tariff
on
manufactured
goods
is
growing
williams
remarked
even
the
organs
are
beginning
to
shout
for
if
they
had
put
it
on
twenty
years
ago
said
lorne
there
would
be
no
twelve
million
people
making
a
problem
for
want
of
work
and
it
would
be
a
good
deal
easier
to
do
imperial
business
you
ll
find
said
john
murchison
removing
his
pipe
that
protection
ll
have
to
come
first
over
there
they
ll
put
up
a
fence
and
save
their
trade
in
their
own
good
time
not
next
week
or
next
year
and
when
they
ve
done
that
they
ll
talk
to
us
about
our
big
ideas
not
before
and
if
wallingham
hadn
t
frightened
them
with
the
imperial
job
he
never
would
have
got
them
to
take
up
the
other
it
s
just
his
way
of
getting
both
i
hope
you
re
right
father
said
lorne
with
a
covert
glance
at
his
watch
horace
mrs
williams
i
ll
have
to
get
you
to
excuse
me
i
have
an
engagement
at
he
left
them
with
a
happy
spring
in
his
step
left
them
looking
after
him
talking
of
him
with
pride
and
congratulation
only
stella
with
a
severe
lip
and
a
disapproving
eye
noted
the
direction
he
took
as
he
left
the
house
chapter
xviii
peter
macfarlane
had
carried
the
big
bible
up
the
pulpit
steps
of
knox
church
and
arranged
the
glass
of
water
and
the
notices
to
be
given
out
beside
it
twice
every
sunday
for
twenty
years
he
was
a
small
spare
man
with
thin
grey
hair
that
fell
back
from
the
narrow
dome
of
his
forehead
to
his
coat
collar
decent
and
severe
he
ascended
the
pulpit
exactly
three
minutes
before
the
minister
did
and
the
dignity
with
which
he
put
one
foot
before
the
other
made
his
appearance
a
ceremonious
feature
of
the
service
and
a
thing
quoted
i
was
there
before
peter
was
a
triumphant
evidence
of
punctuality
dr
drummond
would
have
liked
to
make
it
a
test
it
seemed
to
him
no
great
thing
to
expect
the
people
of
knox
church
to
be
there
before
peter
macfarlane
was
also
in
attendance
in
the
vestry
to
help
the
minister
off
with
his
gown
and
hang
it
up
dr
drummond
s
gown
needed
neither
helping
nor
hanging
the
doctor
was
deftness
and
neatness
and
impatience
itself
and
would
have
it
on
the
hook
with
his
own
hands
and
never
a
fold
crooked
after
mr
finlay
on
the
contrary
peter
would
have
to
pick
up
and
smooth
out
ten
to
one
the
garment
would
be
flung
on
a
chair
still
he
was
invariably
standing
by
to
see
it
flung
and
to
hand
mr
finlay
his
hat
and
stick
he
was
surprised
and
put
about
to
find
himself
one
sunday
evening
too
late
for
this
attendance
the
vestry
was
empty
the
gown
was
on
the
floor
peter
gathered
it
up
with
as
perturbed
an
air
as
if
mr
finlay
had
omitted
a
point
of
church
observance
i
doubt
they
get
into
slack
ways
in
these
missions
said
peter
he
had
been
unable
with
dr
drummond
to
see
the
necessity
for
such
extensions
meanwhile
hugh
finlay
in
secular
attire
had
left
the
church
by
the
vestry
door
and
was
rapidly
overtaking
groups
of
his
hearers
as
they
walked
homeward
he
was
unusually
aware
of
his
change
of
dress
because
of
a
letter
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
the
letter
in
that
intimate
place
spread
a
region
of
consciousness
round
it
which
hastened
his
blood
and
his
step
there
was
purpose
in
his
whole
bearing
advena
murchison
looking
back
at
some
suggestion
of
lorne
s
caught
it
and
lost
for
a
moment
the
meaning
of
what
she
said
when
he
overtook
them
with
plain
intention
she
walked
beside
the
two
men
withdrawn
and
silent
like
a
child
it
was
unexpected
and
overwhelming
his
joining
them
after
the
service
accompanying
them
as
it
were
in
the
flesh
after
having
led
them
so
far
in
the
spirit
he
had
never
done
it
before
she
felt
her
heart
confronted
with
a
new
an
immediate
issue
and
suddenly
afraid
it
shrank
from
the
charge
for
which
it
longed
and
would
have
fled
yet
paralysed
with
delight
it
kept
time
with
her
sauntering
feet
they
talked
of
the
sermon
which
had
been
strongly
tinged
with
the
issue
of
the
day
dreamer
as
he
was
by
temperament
finlay
held
to
the
wisdom
of
informing
great
public
questions
with
the
religious
idea
vigorously
disclaimed
that
it
was
anywhere
inadmissible
you
ll
have
to
settle
with
the
doctor
mr
finlay
lorne
warned
him
gaily
if
you
talk
politics
in
knox
church
he
thinks
he
never
do
you
think
said
finlay
that
he
would
object
to
to
one
s
going
as
far
afield
as
i
did
tonight
he
oughtn
t
to
said
lorne
you
should
have
heard
him
when
old
sir
john
macdonald
gerrymandered
the
electoral
districts
and
gave
votes
to
the
moneida
indians
the
way
he
put
it
the
tories
in
the
congregation
couldn
t
say
a
word
but
it
was
a
treat
for
his
fellow
finlay
smiled
gravely
political
convictions
are
a
man
s
birthright
he
said
any
man
or
any
minister
is
a
poor
creature
without
them
but
of
course
there
are
limits
beyond
which
pulpit
influence
should
not
go
and
i
am
sure
dr
drummond
has
the
clearest
perception
of
them
he
seems
to
have
been
a
wonderful
fellow
macdonald
a
man
with
extraordinary
power
of
imaginative
enterprise
i
wonder
whether
he
would
have
seen
his
way
to
linking
up
the
empire
as
he
linked
up
your
provinces
here
he
d
have
hated
uncommonly
to
be
in
opposition
but
i
don
t
see
how
he
could
have
helped
it
lorne
said
he
was
the
godfather
of
canadian
manufacturers
you
know
the
tories
have
always
been
the
industrial
party
he
couldn
t
have
gone
for
letting
english
stuff
in
free
or
cheap
and
yet
he
was
genuinely
loyal
and
attached
to
england
he
would
discriminate
against
manchester
with
tears
in
his
eyes
imperialist
in
his
time
spelled
conservative
now
it
spells
liberal
the
conservatives
have
always
talked
the
loudest
about
the
british
bond
but
when
it
lately
came
to
doing
we
re
on
record
on
the
right
side
and
they
re
on
record
on
the
wrong
but
it
must
make
the
old
man
s
ghost
sick
to
see
to
see
his
court
suit
stolen
advena
finished
for
him
as
disraeli
said
wasn
t
it
disraeli
she
heard
and
hated
the
note
of
constraint
in
her
voice
am
i
reduced
she
thought
indignantly
to
falsetto
and
chose
since
she
must
choose
the
betrayal
of
silence
it
did
one
good
to
hear
the
question
discussed
on
the
higher
level
said
lorne
you
would
think
to
read
the
papers
that
all
its
merits
could
be
put
into
dollars
and
i
ve
noticed
some
of
them
in
terms
of
sentiment
affection
for
the
mother
country
yes
that
s
lugged
in
but
it
doesn
t
cover
the
moral
aspect
lorne
returned
it
s
too
easy
and
obvious
as
well
it
gives
the
enemy
cause
to
well
there
s
a
tremendous
moral
aspect
finlay
said
tremendous
moral
potentialities
hidden
in
the
issue
england
has
more
to
lose
than
she
that
s
just
where
i
felt
as
a
practical
politician
a
little
restless
while
you
were
preaching
said
lorne
laughing
you
seemed
to
think
the
advantage
of
imperialism
was
all
with
england
you
mustn
t
press
that
view
on
us
you
know
we
shall
get
harder
to
bargain
with
besides
from
the
point
of
your
sermon
it
s
all
the
other
oh
i
don
t
agree
the
younger
nations
can
work
out
their
own
salvation
unaided
but
can
england
alone
isn
t
she
too
heavily
weighted
oh
materially
very
likely
but
morally
no
said
lorne
stoutly
there
if
you
like
she
has
accumulations
that
won
t
depreciate
money
isn
t
the
only
capital
the
colonies
offer
investment
i
m
afraid
i
see
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
degeneration
of
age
and
poverty
said
finlay
smiling
or
age
and
wealth
if
you
prefer
and
we
in
the
disadvantage
of
youth
and
easy
success
lorne
retorted
we
re
all
very
well
but
we
re
not
the
men
our
fathers
were
we
need
a
lot
of
licking
into
shape
look
at
that
disgraceful
business
of
ours
in
the
ontario
legislature
the
other
day
and
look
at
that
fellow
of
yours
walking
out
of
office
at
westminster
last
session
because
of
a
disastrous
business
connection
which
he
was
morally
as
clear
of
as
you
or
i
i
tell
you
we
ve
got
to
hang
on
to
the
things
that
make
us
ashamed
and
i
guess
we
ve
got
sense
enough
to
know
it
but
this
is
my
corner
i
am
going
to
look
in
at
the
milburns
advena
good
night
mr
advena
walking
on
with
finlay
became
suddenly
aware
that
he
had
not
once
addressed
her
she
had
the
quick
impression
that
lorne
left
him
bereft
of
a
refuge
his
plight
heartened
her
if
the
politicians
on
both
sides
were
only
as
mutually
appreciative
she
said
the
empire
would
soon
be
for
a
moment
he
did
not
answer
i
am
afraid
the
economic
situation
is
not
quite
analogous
he
said
stiffly
and
absently
when
the
moment
had
passed
why
does
your
brother
always
call
me
mr
finlay
he
demanded
presently
it
isn
t
the
note
of
irritation
in
his
voice
puzzled
her
i
think
the
form
is
commoner
with
us
she
said
even
among
men
who
know
each
other
fairly
her
secret
glance
flashed
over
the
gulf
that
nevertheless
divided
finlay
and
her
brother
that
would
always
divide
them
she
saw
it
with
something
like
pain
which
struggled
through
her
pride
in
both
and
then
you
know
your
calling
i
suppose
it
is
that
he
replied
ill
content
i
ve
noticed
dr
drummond
s
way
she
told
him
with
rising
spirits
it
s
delightful
he
drops
the
mr
with
of
his
own
denomination
only
never
with
wesleyans
or
baptists
for
a
moment
he
always
comes
back
very
genial
from
the
general
assembly
and
full
of
stories
i
said
to
grant
or
macdonald
said
to
me
and
he
always
calls
you
finlay
she
added
shyly
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
know
he
s
to
be
the
new
moderator
is
he
indeed
yes
yes
of
course
i
knew
we
couldn
t
have
a
they
walked
on
through
the
early
autumn
night
it
was
just
not
raining
the
damp
air
was
cool
and
pungent
with
the
smell
of
fallen
leaves
which
lay
thick
under
their
feet
advena
speared
the
dropped
horse
chestnut
husks
with
the
point
of
her
umbrella
as
they
went
along
she
had
picked
up
half
a
dozen
when
he
spoke
again
i
want
to
tell
you
i
have
to
tell
you
something
about
myself
miss
i
should
like
said
advena
steadily
to
it
is
a
matter
that
has
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
curiously
gone
out
of
my
mind
of
late
i
should
say
until
lately
there
was
little
until
lately
i
am
so
poor
a
letter
writer
to
remind
me
of
it
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
but
how
interesting
exclaimed
advena
he
looked
at
her
taken
aback
his
own
mood
was
heavy
it
failed
to
answer
this
lightness
from
her
it
is
hard
to
know
what
he
expected
what
his
unconscious
blood
expected
for
him
but
it
was
not
this
if
he
had
little
wisdom
about
the
hearts
of
women
he
had
less
about
their
behaviour
she
said
nothing
more
but
inclined
her
head
in
an
angle
of
deference
and
expectation
toward
what
he
should
further
communicate
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
ever
told
you
much
about
my
life
in
scotland
he
went
on
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
so
remote
and
disconnected
with
everything
here
i
could
not
suppose
it
would
interest
anyone
i
was
cared
for
and
educated
by
my
father
s
only
sister
a
good
woman
it
was
as
if
she
had
whole
charge
of
the
part
of
my
life
that
was
not
absorbed
in
work
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
make
you
understand
she
was
identified
with
all
the
rest
i
left
it
to
her
shortly
before
i
sailed
for
canada
she
spoke
to
me
of
marriage
in
connection
with
my
work
and
welfare
and
with
a
niece
of
her
husband
s
who
was
staying
with
us
at
the
time
a
person
suitable
in
every
way
apart
from
my
aunt
i
do
not
know
however
i
owed
everything
to
her
and
i
took
her
advice
in
the
matter
i
left
it
to
her
she
is
a
managing
woman
but
she
can
nearly
always
prove
herself
right
her
mind
ran
a
great
deal
a
little
too
much
perhaps
upon
creature
comforts
and
i
suppose
she
thought
that
in
emigrating
a
man
might
do
well
to
companion
that
was
prudent
of
her
said
advena
he
turned
a
look
upon
her
you
are
not
making
a
mock
of
it
he
said
i
am
not
making
a
mock
of
my
aunt
now
writes
to
me
that
miss
christie
s
home
has
been
broken
up
by
the
death
of
her
mother
and
that
if
it
can
be
arranged
she
is
willing
to
come
to
me
here
my
aunt
talks
of
bringing
her
i
am
to
he
said
the
last
words
slowly
as
if
he
weighed
them
they
had
passed
the
turning
to
the
murchisons
walking
on
with
the
single
consciousness
of
a
path
under
them
and
space
before
them
once
or
twice
before
that
had
happened
but
advena
had
always
been
aware
this
time
she
did
not
know
you
are
to
write
she
said
she
sought
in
vain
for
more
words
he
also
throwing
back
his
head
appeared
to
search
the
firmament
for
phrases
without
result
silence
seemed
enforced
between
them
and
walked
with
them
on
into
the
murky
landscape
over
the
fallen
leaves
passing
a
streetlamp
they
quickened
their
steps
looking
furtively
at
the
light
which
seemed
leagued
against
them
with
silence
it
seems
so
extraordinarily
far
away
said
hugh
finlay
of
bross
dumfries
at
length
but
it
will
come
near
advena
replied
i
don
t
think
it
ever
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
leap
of
the
heart
a
wild
sweet
dismay
they
of
course
will
come
but
the
life
of
which
they
are
a
part
and
the
man
whom
i
remember
to
have
been
me
there
is
a
gulf
fixed
it
is
only
the
atlantic
advena
said
she
had
recovered
her
vision
in
spite
of
the
stone
in
her
breast
she
could
look
the
weight
and
the
hurt
she
would
reckon
with
later
what
was
there
after
all
to
do
meanwhile
she
could
look
and
already
she
saw
with
passion
what
had
only
begun
to
form
itself
in
his
consciousness
his
strange
ironical
pitiful
plight
he
shook
his
head
it
is
not
marked
in
any
geography
he
said
and
gave
her
a
troubled
smile
how
can
i
make
it
clear
to
you
i
have
come
here
into
a
new
world
of
interests
unknown
and
scope
unguessed
before
i
know
what
you
would
say
but
you
have
no
way
of
learning
the
beauty
and
charm
of
mere
vitality
you
have
always
been
so
alive
one
finds
a
physical
freedom
in
which
one
s
very
soul
seems
to
expand
one
hears
the
happiest
calls
of
fancy
and
the
most
wonderful
most
delightful
thing
of
all
is
to
discover
that
one
is
oneself
strangely
enough
able
to
respond
the
words
reached
the
woman
beside
him
like
some
cool
dropping
balm
healing
inconceivably
precious
she
knew
her
share
in
all
this
that
he
recounted
he
might
not
dream
of
it
might
well
confound
her
with
the
general
pulse
but
she
knew
the
sweet
and
separate
subcurrent
that
her
life
had
been
in
his
felt
herself
underlying
all
these
new
joys
of
his
could
tell
him
how
dear
she
was
but
it
seemed
that
he
must
not
guess
it
came
to
her
with
force
that
his
dim
perception
of
his
case
was
grotesque
that
it
humiliated
him
she
had
a
quick
desire
that
he
should
at
least
know
that
civilized
sentient
beings
did
not
lend
themselves
to
such
outrageous
comedies
as
this
which
he
had
confessed
it
had
somehow
the
air
of
a
confession
she
could
not
let
him
fall
so
lamentably
short
of
man
s
dignity
of
man
s
estate
for
his
own
sake
it
is
a
curious
history
she
said
you
are
right
in
thinking
i
should
not
find
it
quite
easy
to
understand
we
make
those
arrangements
so
much
more
for
ourselves
over
here
perhaps
we
think
them
more
important
than
they
but
they
are
of
the
highest
he
stopped
short
confounded
i
shall
try
to
consecrate
my
marriage
he
said
presently
more
to
himself
than
to
advena
her
thought
told
him
bitterly
i
am
afraid
it
is
the
only
thing
you
can
do
with
it
but
something
else
came
to
her
lips
i
have
not
congratulated
you
i
am
not
sure
she
went
on
with
astonishing
candour
whether
i
can
but
i
wish
you
happiness
with
all
my
heart
are
you
happy
now
he
turned
his
great
dark
eyes
on
her
i
am
as
happy
i
dare
say
as
i
have
any
need
to
but
you
are
happier
since
your
letter
came
no
he
said
the
simple
word
fell
on
her
heart
and
she
forbore
they
went
on
again
in
silence
until
they
arrived
at
a
place
from
which
they
saw
the
gleam
of
the
river
and
the
line
of
the
hills
beyond
advena
stopped
we
came
here
once
before
together
in
the
spring
do
you
remember
she
asked
i
remember
very
she
had
turned
and
he
with
her
they
stood
together
with
darkness
about
them
through
which
they
could
just
see
each
other
s
faces
it
was
spring
then
and
i
went
back
alone
you
are
still
living
up
that
street
good
night
then
please
i
wish
again
to
go
back
he
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
in
dumb
bewilderment
though
her
words
were
simple
enough
then
as
she
made
a
step
away
from
him
he
caught
her
hand
advena
he
faltered
what
has
happened
to
us
this
time
i
can
not
let
chapter
xix
lorne
said
dora
milburn
in
her
most
animated
manner
who
do
you
think
is
coming
to
elgin
your
london
friend
mr
hesketh
he
s
going
to
stay
with
the
emmetts
and
mrs
emmett
is
perfectly
distracted
she
says
he
s
accustomed
to
so
much
she
doesn
t
know
how
he
will
put
up
with
their
plain
way
of
living
though
what
she
means
by
that
with
late
dinner
and
afternoon
tea
every
day
of
her
life
is
more
than
i
why
that
s
splendid
replied
lorne
good
old
hesketh
i
knew
he
thought
of
coming
across
this
fall
but
the
brute
hasn
t
written
to
me
we
ll
have
to
get
him
over
to
our
place
when
he
gets
tired
of
the
emmetts
plain
ways
he
can
try
ours
they
re
plainer
you
ll
like
hesketh
he
s
a
good
fellow
and
more
than
most
of
i
don
t
think
i
should
ask
him
to
stay
if
i
were
you
lorne
your
mother
will
never
consent
to
change
her
hours
for
meals
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
asking
an
englishman
to
stay
if
i
couldn
t
give
him
late
dinner
they
think
so
much
of
it
it
s
the
trial
of
mother
s
life
that
father
will
not
submit
to
it
as
a
girl
she
was
used
to
nothing
else
afternoon
tea
we
do
have
he
can
t
prevent
that
but
father
kicks
at
anything
but
one
o
clock
dinner
and
meat
tea
at
six
and
i
suppose
he
always
doesn
t
one
tea
spoil
the
other
lorne
inquired
i
find
it
does
when
i
go
to
your
minister
s
and
peck
at
a
cress
sandwich
at
five
you
haven
t
any
appetite
for
a
reasonable
meal
at
six
but
i
guess
it
won
t
matter
to
hesketh
he
s
got
a
lot
of
sense
about
things
of
that
sort
why
he
served
out
in
south
africa
volunteered
mrs
emmett
needn
t
worry
and
if
we
find
him
pining
for
afternoon
tea
we
can
send
him
over
well
if
he
s
nice
but
i
suppose
he
s
pretty
sure
to
be
nice
any
friend
of
the
emmetts
what
is
he
like
lorne
oh
he
s
just
a
young
man
with
a
moustache
you
seem
to
see
a
good
many
over
there
they
re
all
alike
while
they
re
at
school
in
round
coats
and
after
they
leave
school
they
get
moustaches
and
then
they
re
all
alike
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
tease
how
tall
is
he
is
he
fair
or
dark
what
colour
are
his
eyes
lorne
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
in
a
pretended
agony
of
recollection
so
far
as
i
remember
not
exactly
tall
but
you
wouldn
t
call
him
short
complexion
well
don
t
you
know
that
kind
of
middling
complexion
colour
of
his
eyes
does
anybody
ever
notice
a
thing
like
that
you
needn
t
take
my
word
for
it
but
i
should
say
they
were
a
kind
of
average
coloured
lorne
you
are
i
suppose
i
ll
just
have
to
wait
till
i
see
him
but
the
girls
are
wild
to
know
and
i
said
i
d
ask
you
he
ll
be
here
in
about
two
weeks
anyhow
and
i
dare
say
we
won
t
find
him
so
much
to
make
a
fuss
about
the
best
sort
of
englishmen
don
t
come
over
such
a
very
great
deal
as
you
say
i
expect
they
have
a
better
time
at
hesketh
s
a
very
good
sort
of
englishman
said
lorne
he
s
awfully
well
off
isn
t
he
according
to
our
ideas
i
suppose
he
is
said
lorne
not
according
to
english
still
less
according
to
new
york
ones
then
asserted
dora
they
wouldn
t
think
much
of
it
there
even
if
he
passed
for
rich
in
it
was
a
little
as
if
she
resented
lorne
s
comparison
of
standards
and
claimed
the
american
one
as
at
least
he
has
a
settled
income
said
lorne
and
he
s
never
had
to
work
for
it
whatever
luck
there
is
in
that
that
s
all
i
know
dora
now
lorne
you
re
not
to
be
your
mother
hasn
t
come
in
at
all
this
evening
don
t
you
think
it
s
a
good
sign
she
isn
t
quite
so
silly
as
she
was
remarked
dora
why
i
should
not
have
the
same
freedom
as
other
girls
in
entertaining
my
gentleman
friends
i
never
could
quite
i
believe
if
we
told
her
we
had
made
up
our
minds
it
would
be
all
right
he
pleaded
i
m
not
so
sure
lorne
mother
s
so
deep
you
can
t
always
tell
just
by
what
she
does
she
thinks
stephen
stuart
likes
me
it
s
too
perfectly
idiotic
we
are
the
merest
friends
and
when
it
s
any
question
of
you
and
stephen
well
she
doesn
t
say
anything
but
she
lets
me
see
she
thinks
such
a
lot
of
the
stuarts
because
stephen
s
father
was
ontario
premier
once
and
got
i
might
try
for
that
myself
if
you
think
it
would
please
her
said
the
lover
please
her
and
i
should
be
lady
murchison
she
let
fall
upon
his
ravished
ears
why
lorne
she
d
just
worship
us
both
but
you
ll
never
do
why
not
dora
looked
at
him
with
pretty
speculation
she
had
reasons
for
supposing
that
she
did
admire
the
young
man
you
re
too
nice
she
said
that
isn
t
good
enough
he
responded
and
drew
her
nearer
then
why
did
you
ask
me
no
lorne
you
are
not
to
suppose
father
came
in
i
shouldn
t
mind
father
s
on
my
side
i
father
isn
t
on
anybody
s
side
said
his
daughter
wisely
dora
let
me
speak
to
him
miss
milburn
gave
a
clever
imitation
of
a
little
scream
of
horror
indeed
i
won
t
lorne
you
are
never
never
to
do
that
as
if
we
were
in
a
ridiculous
english
novel
that
s
the
part
of
an
english
novel
i
always
like
said
lorne
the
going
and
asking
it
must
about
scare
the
hero
out
of
a
year
s
growth
but
it
s
a
glorious
thing
to
do
it
would
be
next
day
it
s
just
the
sort
of
thing
to
please
mother
dora
meditated
but
she
can
t
be
indulged
all
the
time
no
lorne
you
ll
have
to
leave
it
to
me
when
there
s
anything
to
there
s
everything
to
tell
now
said
he
who
had
indeed
nothing
to
keep
back
but
you
know
what
mother
is
lorne
suppose
they
hadn
t
any
objection
she
would
never
keep
it
to
herself
she
d
want
to
go
announcing
it
all
over
the
place
she
d
think
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
but
dora
why
not
if
you
knew
how
i
want
to
announce
it
i
should
like
to
publish
it
in
the
sunrise
and
the
wind
so
that
i
couldn
t
go
out
of
doors
without
seeing
it
i
shouldn
t
mind
having
it
in
toronto
society
when
the
time
comes
but
not
yet
lorne
not
for
ages
i
m
only
nobody
thinks
of
settling
down
nowadays
before
she
s
at
the
very
earliest
i
don
t
know
a
single
girl
in
this
town
that
has
among
my
friends
anyway
that
s
three
years
off
and
you
can
t
expect
me
to
be
engaged
for
three
said
lorne
engaged
six
months
married
the
rest
of
the
time
or
the
periods
might
run
concurrently
if
you
preferred
i
shouldn
t
an
engaged
girl
has
the
very
worst
time
she
gets
hardly
any
attention
and
as
to
dances
well
it
s
a
good
thing
for
her
if
the
person
she
s
engaged
to
can
dance
she
added
teasingly
lorne
coloured
you
said
i
was
improving
dora
he
said
and
then
laughed
at
the
childish
claim
but
that
isn
t
really
a
thing
that
counts
is
it
if
our
lives
only
keep
step
it
won
t
matter
much
about
the
washington
and
so
far
as
attention
goes
you
ll
get
it
as
long
as
you
live
you
little
princess
besides
isn
t
it
better
to
wear
the
love
of
one
man
than
the
admiration
of
half
a
dozen
and
be
teased
and
worried
half
out
of
your
life
by
everybody
you
meet
now
lorne
you
re
getting
serious
and
sentimental
and
you
know
i
hate
that
it
isn
t
any
good
either
mother
always
used
to
say
it
made
me
more
stubborn
to
appeal
to
me
horrid
nature
to
have
isn
t
it
lorne
s
hand
went
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
came
back
with
a
tiny
packet
it
s
come
dora
by
this
morning
s
english
her
eyes
sparkled
and
then
rested
with
guarded
excitement
upon
the
little
case
oh
lorne
she
said
nothing
more
but
watched
intently
while
he
found
the
spring
and
disclosed
the
ring
within
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
lorne
murchison
what
a
lovely
one
doesn
t
it
look
said
he
just
a
little
serious
and
sentimental
but
such
good
style
too
he
declared
bending
over
it
and
quite
new
i
haven
t
seen
anything
a
bit
like
it
i
do
love
a
design
when
it
s
graceful
solitaires
are
so
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
her
face
feeding
upon
the
delight
in
it
exultation
rose
up
in
him
he
knew
the
primitive
guile
of
man
indifferent
to
such
things
alluring
with
them
the
other
creature
he
did
not
stop
to
condone
her
weakness
rather
he
seized
it
in
ecstasy
it
was
all
part
of
the
glad
scheme
to
help
the
lover
he
turned
the
diamonds
so
that
they
flashed
and
flashed
again
before
her
then
trusting
his
happy
instinct
he
sought
for
her
hand
but
she
held
that
back
i
want
to
see
it
she
declared
and
he
was
obliged
to
let
her
take
the
ring
in
her
own
way
and
examine
it
and
place
it
in
every
light
and
compare
it
with
others
worn
by
her
friends
and
make
little
tentative
charges
of
extravagance
in
his
purchase
of
it
while
he
sat
elated
and
adoring
the
simple
fellow
reluctantly
at
last
she
gave
up
her
hand
but
it
s
only
trying
on
not
putting
on
she
told
him
he
said
nothing
till
it
flashed
upon
her
finger
and
in
her
eyes
he
saw
a
spark
from
below
of
that
instinctive
cupidity
toward
jewels
that
man
can
never
recognize
as
it
deserves
in
woman
because
of
his
desire
to
gratify
it
you
ll
wear
it
dora
he
pleaded
lorne
you
are
the
dearest
fellow
but
how
could
i
everybody
would
guess
her
gaze
nevertheless
rested
fascinated
on
the
ring
which
she
posed
as
it
pleased
her
let
them
guess
i
d
rather
they
knew
but
it
does
look
well
on
your
finger
she
held
it
up
once
more
to
the
light
then
slipped
it
decisively
off
and
gave
it
back
to
him
i
can
t
you
know
lorne
i
didn
t
really
say
you
might
get
it
and
now
you
ll
have
to
keep
it
till
till
the
time
comes
but
this
much
i
will
say
it
s
the
sweetest
thing
and
you
ve
shown
the
loveliest
taste
and
if
it
weren
t
such
a
dreadful
i
d
like
to
wear
it
they
discussed
it
with
argument
with
endearment
with
humour
and
reproach
but
her
inflexible
basis
soon
showed
through
their
talk
she
would
not
wear
the
ring
so
far
he
prevailed
that
it
was
she
not
he
who
kept
it
her
insistence
that
he
should
take
it
back
brought
something
like
anger
out
of
him
and
in
the
surprise
of
this
she
yielded
so
much
she
did
it
unwillingly
at
the
time
but
afterward
when
she
tried
on
the
thing
again
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
she
was
rather
satisfied
to
have
it
safe
under
lock
and
key
a
flashing
smiling
mystery
to
visit
when
she
liked
and
reveal
when
she
would
lorne
could
never
get
me
such
a
beauty
again
if
he
lost
it
she
advised
herself
and
he
s
awfully
careless
and
i
m
not
sure
that
i
won
t
tell
eva
delarue
just
to
show
it
to
her
she
s
as
close
as
one
feels
a
certain
sorrow
for
the
lover
on
his
homeward
way
squaring
his
shoulders
against
the
foolish
perversity
of
the
feminine
mind
resolutely
guarding
his
heart
from
any
hint
of
real
reprobation
through
the
sweetness
of
her
lips
and
the
affection
of
her
pretty
eyes
through
all
his
of
all
her
charms
and
graces
must
have
come
dully
the
sense
of
his
great
occasion
manque
that
dear
day
of
love
when
it
leaves
the
mark
of
its
claim
and
in
one
s
regret
there
is
perhaps
some
alloy
of
pity
that
less
respectful
thing
we
know
him
elsewhere
capable
of
essaying
heights
yet
we
seem
to
look
down
upon
the
drama
of
his
heart
it
may
be
well
to
remember
that
the
level
is
not
everything
in
love
he
who
carefully
adjusts
an
intellectual
machine
may
descry
a
higher
mark
he
can
construct
nothing
in
a
mistress
he
is
therefore
able
to
see
the
facts
and
to
discriminate
the
desirable
but
lorne
loved
with
all
his
imagination
this
way
dares
the
imitation
of
the
gods
by
which
it
improves
the
quality
of
the
passion
so
that
such
a
love
stands
by
itself
to
be
considered
apart
from
the
object
one
may
say
a
strong
and
beautiful
wave
lifted
lorne
murchison
along
to
his
destiny
since
it
was
the
pulse
of
his
own
life
though
dora
milburn
played
moon
to
it
chapter
xx
alfred
hesketh
had
after
all
written
to
young
murchison
about
his
immediate
intention
of
sailing
for
canada
and
visiting
elgin
the
letter
arrived
a
day
or
two
later
it
was
brief
and
businesslike
but
it
gave
lorne
to
understand
that
since
his
departure
the
imperial
idea
had
been
steadily
fermenting
not
only
in
the
national
mind
but
particularly
in
hesketh
s
that
it
produced
in
his
case
a
condition
only
to
be
properly
treated
by
personal
experience
hesketh
was
coming
over
to
prove
whatever
advantage
there
was
in
seeing
for
yourself
that
he
was
coming
with
the
right
bias
lorne
might
infer
he
said
from
the
fact
that
he
had
waited
a
fortnight
to
get
his
passage
by
the
only
big
line
to
new
york
that
stood
out
for
our
mercantile
supremacy
against
american
combination
he
needn
t
bother
to
bring
any
bias
lorne
remarked
when
he
had
read
this
but
he
ll
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
extra
luggage
on
the
one
he
takes
back
with
he
felt
a
little
irritation
at
being
offered
the
testimony
of
the
cunard
ticket
back
on
his
native
soil
its
independence
ran
again
like
sap
in
him
nobody
wanted
a
present
of
good
will
the
matter
stood
on
its
merits
he
was
glad
nevertheless
that
hesketh
was
coming
gratified
that
it
would
now
be
his
turn
to
show
prospects
and
turn
figures
into
facts
and
make
plain
the
imperial
profit
from
the
further
side
hesketh
was
such
an
intelligent
fellow
there
would
be
the
keenest
sort
of
pleasure
in
demonstrating
things
big
things
to
him
little
things
too
ways
of
living
differences
of
habit
already
in
the
happy
exercise
of
his
hospitable
instinct
he
saw
how
hesketh
would
get
on
with
his
mother
with
stella
with
dr
drummond
he
saw
hesketh
interested
domiciled
remaining
the
ranch
life
this
side
of
the
rockies
lorne
thought
would
tempt
him
or
something
new
and
sound
in
winnipeg
he
kept
his
eye
open
for
chances
and
noted
one
or
two
likely
things
we
want
labour
mostly
he
said
to
advena
but
nobody
is
refused
leave
to
land
because
he
has
a
little
i
should
think
not
indeed
remarked
mrs
murchison
who
was
present
i
often
wish
your
father
and
i
had
had
a
little
more
when
we
began
that
whole
gregory
block
was
going
for
three
thousand
dollars
then
i
wonder
what
it
s
worth
now
yes
but
you
and
father
are
worth
more
too
remarked
stella
acutely
in
fact
all
the
elder
members
of
the
family
have
approximated
in
value
stella
said
her
brother
and
you
may
too
in
i
ll
take
my
chance
with
the
country
she
retorted
they
were
all
permeated
with
the
question
of
the
day
even
stella
after
holding
haughtily
aloof
for
some
time
had
been
obliged
to
get
into
step
as
she
described
it
with
the
silly
old
empire
whatever
it
was
in
england
here
it
was
a
family
affair
i
mean
in
the
town
of
elgin
in
the
shops
and
the
offices
up
and
down
the
streets
as
men
went
to
and
from
their
business

creatures
building
the
reef
of
the
future
but
conscious
and
wanting
to
know
what
they
were
about
political
parties

long
declared
themselves

had
several
grand

been
put
to
this
touchstone
sometimes
with
shattering
effect
if
you
would
not
serve
with
wallingham
the
greatness
of
britain
you
were
held
to
favour
going
over
to
the
united
states
there
was
no
middle
course
it
became
a
personal
matter
in
the
ward

and
small
boys
pursued
small
boys
with
hateful
cries
of
annexationist
the
subject
even
trickled
about

of

square
here
it

have
raged
pregnant
as
it

our

nothing

of

a
measure
of

benefit
to
themselves
those
of

thought
it
looked
very
well

it
was
pretty

to
work
out

advised
we
ain
t
going
to
get
such
big
changes
yet
an
if
we
do
the
blooming
syndicates
ll
spoil
em
for
there
were
even
dissentients
among
the
farmers
the
voice
of
one
was
raised
who
had
lived
laborious
years
and
many
of
them
in
the
hope
of
seeing
his
butter
and
cheese
go
unimpeded
across
the
american
line
it
must
be
said
however
that
still
less
attention
was
paid
to
him
and
it
was
generally
conceded
that
he
would
die
without
the
sight
it
was
the
great
topic
the
day
wallingham
went
his
defiant
furthest
in
the
house
and
every
colonial
newspaper
set
it
up
in
acclaiming
headlines
horace
williams
enterprising
fellow
remembered
that
lorne
had
seen
the
great
man
under
circumstances
that
would
probably
pan
out
and
send
round
rawlins
rawlins
was
to
get
something
that
would
do
to
call
wallingham
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
as
much
as
lorne
cared
to
pour
into
him
about
his
own
view
of
the
probable
issue
rawlins
failed
to
get
the
interview
came
back
to
say
that
lorne
didn
t
seem
to
think
himself
a
big
enough
boy
for
that
but
he
did
not
return
mr
murchison
sent
mr
williams
the
promise
of
some
contributions
upon
the
question
of
the
hour
which
he
had
no
objection
to
sign
and
which
horace
should
have
for
the
good
of
the
cause
horace
duly
had
them
the
express
duly
published
them
and
they
were
copied
in
full
by
the
dominion
and
several
other
leading
journals
with
an
amount
of
comment
which
everyone
but
mrs
murchison
thought
remarkable
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
it
she
said
but
anybody
can
see
that
he
knows
what
he
s
talking
john
murchison
read
them
with
a
critical
eye
and
a
lip
he
takes
too
much
for
what
does
he
take
for
granted
asked
mrs
murchison
other
folks
being
like
himself
said
the
father
that
no
doubt
was
succinct
and
true
nevertheless
the
articles
had
competence
as
well
as
confidence
the
writer
treated
facts
with
restraint
and
conditions
with
sympathy
he
summoned
ideas
from
the
obscurity
of
men
s
minds
and
marshalled
them
in
the
light
so
that
many
recognized
what
they
had
been
trying
to
think
he
wrote
with
homeliness
as
well
as
force
wishing
much
more
to
make
the
issue
recognizable
than
to
create
fine
phrases
with
the
result
that
one
or
two
of
his
sentences
passed
into
the
language
of
the
discussion
which
as
any
of
its
would
have
told
you
had
little
use
for
rhetoric
the
articles
were
competent
if
you
listened
to
horace
williams
you
would
have
been
obliged
to
accept
them
as
the
last
or
latest
word
of
economic
truth
though
it
must
be
left
to
history
to
endorse
mr
williams
it
was
their
enthusiasm
however
that
gave
them
the
wing
on
which
they
travelled
people
naturally
took
different
views
even
of
this
quality
young
murchison
s
working
the
imperial
idea
for
all
it
s
worth
was
walter
winter
s
and
octavius
milburn
humorously
summed
up
the
series
as
tall
alfred
hesketh
came
it
was
felt
rather
opportunely
into
the
midst
of
this
plenty
of
people
the
whole
of
market
square
and
east
elgin
a
good
part
too
probably
of
the
town
ward
were
unaware
of
his
arrival
but
for
the
little
world
he
penetrated
he
was
clothed
with
all
the
interest
of
the
great
contingency
his
decorous
head
in
the
emmetts
pew
on
sunday
morning
stood
for
a
symbol
as
well
as
for
a
stranger
the
nation
was
on
the
eve
of
a
great
transaction
with
the
mother
country
and
thrilling
with
the
terms
of
the
bargain
hesketh
was
regarded
by
people
in
elgin
who
knew
who
he
was
with
the
mingled
cordiality
and
distrust
that
might
have
met
a
principal
they
did
not
perhaps
say
it
but
it
was
in
their
minds
there
s
one
of
them
was
what
they
thought
when
they
met
him
in
the
street
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
been
just
an
englishman
now
he
was
invested
with
the
very
romance
of
destiny
the
perception
was
obscure
but
it
was
there
hesketh
on
the
other
hand
found
these
good
people
a
very
decent
lot
rather
sallower
than
he
expected
perhaps
who
seemed
to
live
in
a
town
in
a
great
deal
of
comfort
and
was
wholly
unconscious
of
anything
special
in
his
relation
to
them
or
theirs
to
him
he
met
lorne
just
outside
the
office
of
warner
fulke
and
murchison
the
following
day
they
greeted
heartily
now
this
is
good
said
lorne
and
he
thought
so
hesketh
confided
his
first
impression
it
s
not
unlike
an
english
country
town
he
said
only
the
streets
are
wider
and
the
people
don
t
look
so
much
in
oh
they
re
just
as
much
in
earnest
some
of
the
time
lorne
laughed
but
maybe
not
all
the
time
the
sun
shone
crisply
round
them
there
was
a
brisk
october
market
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
elmore
crow
dangled
his
long
legs
over
a
cart
flap
and
chewed
a
cheroot
elgin
was
abroad
doing
business
on
its
wide
margin
of
opportunity
lorne
cast
a
backward
glance
at
conditions
he
had
seen
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
sharp
of
you
to
spot
it
so
soon
old
chap
you
re
staying
with
the
english
church
minister
aren
t
you
mr
emmett
some
connection
of
yours
aren
t
they
mrs
emmett
is
chafe
s
sister
mrs
chafe
you
know
is
my
aunt
hesketh
reminded
him
i
say
murchison
i
left
old
chafe
wilder
than
ever
wallingham
s
committee
keep
sending
him
leaflets
and
things
they
take
it
for
granted
he
s
on
the
right
side
since
his
interests
are
the
other
day
they
asked
him
for
a
subscription
the
old
boy
sent
his
reply
to
the
daily
news
and
carried
it
about
for
a
week
i
think
that
gave
him
real
satisfaction
but
he
hates
the
things
by
lorne
laughed
delightedly
i
expect
he
s
snowed
under
with
them
i
sent
him
my
own
valuable
views
last
i
m
afraid
they
ll
only
stiffen
him
that
got
to
be
his
great
argument
after
you
left
the
fact
that
you
fellows
over
here
want
it
he
doesn
t
approve
of
a
bargain
if
the
other
side
sees
a
profit
curiously
enough
his
foremen
and
people
out
in
chiswick
are
all
for
it
i
was
talking
to
one
of
them
just
before
i
left
stands
to
reason
sir
he
said
we
don
t
want
to
pay
more
for
a
loaf
than
we
do
now
but
we
ll
do
it
sir
if
it
means
downing
them
germans
he
lorne
s
eyebrows
twitched
they
do
sir
you
a
lot
over
there
don
t
they
he
said
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
get
at
what
a
fellow
of
that
sort
meant
tumbling
over
the
sirs
he
propped
it
up
with
well
all
kinds
of
people
all
kinds
of
argument
i
suppose
when
it
comes
to
trying
to
get
em
solid
but
i
was
going
to
say
we
are
all
hoping
you
ll
give
us
a
part
of
your
time
while
you
re
in
elgin
my
family
are
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
come
along
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
father
now
he
s
only
round
the
by
all
means
said
hesketh
and
they
fell
into
step
together
as
lorne
said
it
was
only
a
short
distance
but
far
enough
to
communicate
a
briskness
an
alertness
from
the
step
of
one
young
man
to
that
of
the
other
i
wish
it
were
five
miles
hesketh
said
all
his
muscles
responding
to
the
new
call
of
his
heart
and
lungs
any
good
walks
about
here
i
asked
emmett
but
he
didn
t
know
supposed
you
could
walk
to
clayfield
if
you
didn
t
take
the
car
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
legs
i
suppose
parsons
not
all
of
them
said
lorne
there
s
a
fellow
that
has
a
church
over
in
east
elgin
finlay
his
name
is
that
beats
the
record
of
anything
around
here
he
just
about
ranges
the
county
in
the
course
of
a
the
place
is
too
big
for
one
parish
no
doubt
hesketh
remarked
oh
he
s
a
presbyterian
the
episcopalians
haven
t
got
any
hold
to
speak
of
over
there
here
we
are
said
lorne
and
turned
in
at
the
door
the
old
wooden
sign
was
long
gone
john
murchison
and
sons
glittered
instead
in
the
windows
but
hesketh
did
not
see
it
why
do
you
think
he
ll
be
in
here
he
asked
on
young
murchison
s
heels
because
he
always
is
when
he
isn
t
over
at
the
shop
replied
lorne
it
s
his
place
of
business
his
store
you
know
there
he
is
hard
luck
he
s
got
a
customer
we
ll
have
to
he
went
on
ahead
with
his
impetuous
step
he
did
not
perceive
the
instant
s
paralysis
that
seemed
to
overtake
hesketh
s
whose
foot
dragged
however
no
longer
than
that
it
was
an
initiation
he
had
been
told
he
might
expect
some
he
checked
his
impulse
to
be
amused
and
guarded
his
look
round
not
to
show
unseemly
curiosity
his
face
when
he
was
introduced
to
alec
who
was
sorting
some
odd
dozens
of
tablespoons
was
neutral
and
pleasant
he
reflected
afterward
that
he
had
been
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
he
thought
too
that
he
had
shown
some
adaptability
alec
was
not
a
person
of
fluent
discourse
and
when
he
had
inquired
whether
hesketh
was
going
to
make
a
long
stay
the
conversation
might
have
languished
but
for
this
is
that
birmingham
he
asked
nodding
kindly
at
the
spoons
came
to
us
through
a
house
in
liverpool
alec
responded
i
expect
you
had
a
stormy
crossing
mr
it
was
a
bit
choppy
we
had
the
fiddles
on
most
of
the
time
hesketh
replied
most
of
the
time
now
how
do
you
find
the
bicycle
trade
over
here
languishing
as
it
is
with
us
oh
it
keeps
up
pretty
well
said
alec
but
we
sell
more
spoons
n
what
do
you
think
of
this
country
far
as
you
ve
seen
it
oh
come
now
it
s
a
little
soon
to
ask
isn
t
it
yes
i
suppose
bicycles
go
out
of
fashion
and
spoons
never
do
i
was
thinking
added
hesketh
casting
his
eyes
over
a
serried
rank
of
buying
a
alec
had
turned
to
put
the
spoons
in
their
place
on
the
shelves
better
take
your
friend
across
to
cox
s
he
advised
lorne
over
his
shoulder
he
ll
be
able
to
get
a
motorbike
there
a
suggestion
which
gave
mr
hesketh
to
reflect
later
that
if
that
was
the
general
idea
of
doing
business
it
must
be
an
easy
country
to
make
money
in
the
customer
was
satisfied
at
last
and
mr
murchison
walked
sociably
to
the
door
with
him
it
was
the
secretary
of
the
local
oddfellows
lodge
who
had
come
in
about
a
furnace
now
s
our
chance
said
lorne
father
this
is
mr
hesketh
from
london
my
father
hesketh
he
can
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
about
canada
this
part
of
it
anyway
over
thirty
years
isn
t
it
father
since
you
came
out
glad
to
meet
you
said
john
murchison
glad
to
meet
you
mr
hesketh
we
ve
heard
much
about
you
must
have
been
quite
among
the
pioneers
of
elgin
mr
murchison
said
hesketh
as
they
shook
hands
alec
hadn
t
seemed
to
think
of
that
hesketh
put
it
down
to
the
counter
not
quite
said
john
we
ll
say
among
the
early
have
you
ever
been
back
in
your
native
scotland
asked
hesketh
aye
but
you
prefer
the
land
of
your
adoption
i
do
but
i
think
by
now
it
ll
be
kin
said
mr
murchison
it
was
good
to
see
the
heather
again
but
a
man
lives
best
where
he
s
taken
yes
yes
you
seem
to
do
a
large
business
here
mr
pretty
well
for
the
size
of
the
place
you
must
get
lorne
to
take
you
over
elgin
it
s
a
fair
sample
of
our
rising
manufacturing
i
hope
he
will
i
understand
you
manufacture
to
some
extent
yourself
we
make
our
own
stoves
and
a
few
odd
you
don
t
send
any
across
the
atlantic
yet
queried
hesketh
jocularly
not
yet
no
sir
then
did
mr
hesketh
show
himself
in
true
sympathy
with
the
novel
and
independent
conditions
of
the
commonwealth
he
found
himself
in
i
beg
you
won
t
use
that
form
with
me
he
said
i
know
it
isn
t
the
custom
of
the
country
and
i
am
a
friend
of
your
son
s
you
the
iron
merchant
looked
at
him
just
an
instant
s
regard
in
which
astonishment
struggled
with
the
usual
deliberation
then
his
considering
hand
went
to
his
chin
i
see
i
must
remember
he
said
the
son
lorne
glanced
in
the
pause
beyond
john
murchison
s
broad
shoulders
through
the
store
door
and
out
into
the
moderate
commerce
of
main
street
which
had
carried
the
significance
and
the
success
of
his
father
s
life
his
eye
came
back
and
moved
over
the
contents
of
the
place
taking
stock
of
it
one
might
say
and
adjusting
the
balance
with
pride
he
had
said
very
little
since
they
had
been
in
the
store
now
he
turned
to
hesketh
quietly
i
wouldn
t
bother
about
that
if
i
were
you
he
said
my
father
spoke
quite
oh
said
hesketh
they
parted
on
the
pavement
outside
i
hope
you
understand
said
lorne
with
an
effort
at
heartiness
how
glad
my
parents
will
be
to
have
you
if
you
find
yourself
able
to
spare
us
any
of
your
time
thanks
very
much
said
hesketh
i
shall
certainly
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
as
soon
as
chapter
xxi
dear
me
said
dr
drummond
dear
me
well
and
what
does
advena
murchison
say
to
all
this
he
and
hugh
finlay
were
sitting
in
the
doctor
s
study
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
it
was
lined
with
standard
religious
philosophy
standard
poets
standard
fiction
all
that
was
standard
and
nothing
that
was
not
and
the
shelves
included
several
volumes
of
the
doctor
s
own
sermons
published
in
black
morocco
through
a
local
firm
that
did
business
by
the
subscription
method
with
drummond
in
gold
letters
on
the
back
there
were
more
copies
of
these
perhaps
than
it
would
be
quite
thoughtful
to
count
though
a
good
many
were
annually
disposed
of
at
the
church
bazaar
where
the
doctor
presented
them
with
a
generous
hand
a
sumptuous
desk
and
luxurious
armchairs
furnished
the
room
a
beautiful
little
parian
copy
of
a
famous
cupid
and
psyche
decorated
the
mantelpiece
and
betrayed
the
touch
of
pagan
in
the
presbyterian
a
bright
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
there
was
not
a
speck
of
dust
anywhere
dr
drummond
lost
in
his
chair
with
one
knee
dropped
on
the
other
joined
his
fingers
at
the
tips
and
drew
his
forehead
into
a
web
of
wrinkles
over
it
his
militant
grey
crest
curled
up
under
it
his
eyes
darted
two
shrewd
points
of
interrogation
what
does
miss
murchison
say
to
it
he
repeated
with
craft
and
courage
as
finlay
s
eyes
dropped
and
his
face
slowly
flushed
under
the
question
it
was
in
this
room
that
dr
drummond
examined
intending
communicants
and
cases
likely
to
come
before
the
session
he
never
shirked
a
leading
question
miss
murchison
said
finlay
after
a
moment
was
good
enough
to
say
that
she
thought
her
father
s
house
would
be
open
to
miss
to
my
friends
when
they
arrived
but
i
thought
it
would
be
more
suitable
to
ask
your
hospitality
did
she
so
asked
dr
drummond
gravely
it
was
more
a
comment
than
an
inquiry
did
she
so
infinite
kindness
was
in
it
the
young
man
assented
with
an
awkward
gesture
and
neither
for
a
moment
spoke
again
it
was
one
of
those
silences
with
a
character
conscious
tentative
disavowed
thoughts
rose
up
in
it
awakened
by
advena
s
name
turning
away
their
heads
the
ticking
of
the
doctor
s
watch
came
through
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
i
christened
advena
murchison
he
said
her
father
was
one
of
those
who
called
me
as
a
young
man
to
this
ministry
the
names
of
both
her
parents
are
on
my
first
communion
roll
aye
the
fire
snapped
and
the
watch
went
on
ticking
so
advena
thought
well
of
it
all
did
she
so
the
young
man
raised
his
heavy
eyes
and
looked
unflinchingly
at
dr
drummond
miss
murchison
he
said
is
the
only
other
person
to
whom
i
have
confided
the
matter
i
have
written
fixing
that
date
with
her
approval
at
her
desire
not
immediately
i
took
time
to
think
it
over
then
it
seemed
better
to
arrange
for
the
ladies
reception
first
so
before
posting
i
have
come
to
then
the
letter
has
not
gone
it
is
in
my
finlay
you
will
have
a
cigar
i
don
t
smoke
myself
my
throat
won
t
stand
it
but
i
understand
these
are
passable
grant
left
them
here
he
s
a
chimney
that
man
grant
at
it
day
and
this
was
a
sacrifice
dr
drummond
hated
tobacco
the
smell
of
it
the
ash
of
it
the
time
consumed
in
it
there
was
no
need
at
all
to
offer
finlay
one
of
the
reverend
grant
s
cigars
propitiation
must
indeed
be
desired
when
the
incense
is
abhorred
but
finlay
declined
to
smoke
the
doctor
with
his
hands
buried
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
where
something
metallic
clinked
in
them
began
to
pace
and
turn
his
mouth
had
the
set
it
wore
when
he
handled
a
difficult
motion
in
the
general
assembly
i
m
surprised
to
hear
that
finlay
though
it
may
be
well
not
to
be
surprised
at
what
a
woman
will
say
or
won
t
surprised
said
the
younger
man
confusedly
why
should
anyone
be
surprised
i
know
her
well
i
ve
watched
her
grow
up
i
remember
her
mother
s
trouble
because
she
would
scratch
the
paint
on
the
pew
in
front
of
her
with
the
nails
in
her
little
boots
john
murchison
sang
in
the
choir
in
those
days
he
had
a
fine
bass
voice
he
has
it
still
and
mrs
murchison
had
to
keep
the
family
in
order
by
herself
it
was
sometimes
as
much
as
she
could
do
poor
woman
they
sat
near
the
front
and
many
a
good
hard
look
i
used
to
give
them
while
i
was
preaching
knox
church
was
a
different
place
then
the
choir
sat
in
the
back
gallery
and
we
had
a
precentor
a
fine
fellow
he
lost
an
arm
at
ridgway
in
the
fenian
raid
well
i
mind
him
and
the
frown
he
would
put
on
when
he
took
up
the
fork
but
for
that
matter
every
man
jack
in
the
choir
had
a
frown
on
in
the
singing
though
the
bass
fellows
would
be
the
fiercest
we
ve
been
twice
enlarged
since
and
the
organist
has
long
been
a
salaried
professional
but
i
doubt
whether
the
praise
of
god
is
any
heartier
than
it
was
when
it
followed
peter
craig
s
aye
you
d
always
hear
john
murchison
s
note
in
the
finlay
was
listening
with
the
look
of
a
charmed
animal
dr
drummond
s
voice
was
never
more
vibrant
more
moving
more
compelling
than
when
he
called
up
the
past
and
here
to
finlay
the
past
was
itself
enchanted
she
always
had
those
wonderful
dark
eyes
she
s
pale
enough
now
but
as
a
child
she
was
rosy
taking
her
place
of
a
winter
evening
with
the
snow
on
her
fur
cap
and
her
hair
i
often
thought
her
a
picture
i
liked
to
have
her
attention
while
i
was
preaching
even
as
a
child
and
when
she
was
absent
i
missed
her
it
was
through
my
ministrations
that
she
saw
her
way
to
professing
the
church
of
christ
and
under
my
heartfelt
benediction
that
she
first
broke
bread
in
her
father
s
house
i
hold
the
girl
in
great
affection
finlay
and
i
grieve
to
hear
the
other
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
hand
tightened
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
was
as
we
know
blind
to
many
of
the
world
s
aspects
even
to
those
in
which
he
himself
figured
and
dr
drummond
s
plain
hypothesis
of
his
relations
with
advena
came
before
him
in
forced
illumination
flash
by
tragic
flash
this
kind
of
revelation
is
more
discomforting
than
darkness
since
it
carries
the
surprise
of
assault
and
finlay
groped
in
it
helpless
and
silent
you
are
grieved
sir
he
said
mechanically
man
she
loves
you
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
a
tone
that
would
no
longer
forbear
hugh
finlay
seemed
to
take
the
words
just
where
they
were
levelled
in
his
breast
he
half
leaped
from
his
chair
the
lower
part
of
his
face
had
the
rigidity
of
iron
i
am
not
obliged
to
discuss
such
a
matter
as
that
he
said
hoarsely
with
you
or
with
any
he
looked
confusedly
about
him
for
his
hat
which
he
had
left
in
the
hall
and
dr
drummond
profited
by
the
instant
he
stepped
across
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
younger
man
s
shoulder
had
they
both
been
standing
the
gesture
would
have
been
impossible
to
dr
drummond
with
dignity
as
it
was
it
had
not
only
that
but
benignance
a
kind
of
tender
good
will
rare
in
expression
with
the
minister
rare
for
that
matter
in
feeling
with
him
too
though
the
chord
was
always
there
to
be
sounded
finlay
he
said
finlay
between
two
such
temperaments
the
touch
and
the
tone
together
made
an
extraordinary
demonstration
finlay
with
an
obvious
effort
let
it
lie
upon
him
the
tension
of
his
body
relaxed
that
of
his
soul
he
covered
leaning
forward
and
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
will
you
say
i
have
no
claim
to
speak
asked
dr
drummond
and
met
silence
it
is
upon
my
lips
to
beg
you
not
to
send
that
letter
he
took
his
hand
from
the
young
man
s
shoulder
inserted
a
thumb
in
each
of
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
resumed
his
walk
on
my
own
account
i
must
send
it
said
finlay
on
miss
murchison
s
she
bids
me
to
we
have
gone
into
the
matter
i
can
imagine
what
you
made
of
it
together
there
s
a
good
deal
of
her
father
in
advena
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
say
a
word
for
himself
you
told
her
this
tale
you
have
told
me
and
she
told
you
to
get
miss
christie
out
and
marry
her
without
delay
eh
and
what
would
you
expect
her
to
tell
you
a
girl
of
that
spirit
i
can
not
see
why
pride
should
influence
then
you
know
little
about
women
it
was
pride
pure
and
simple
finlay
that
made
her
tell
you
that
and
she
ll
be
a
sorry
woman
if
you
act
on
no
said
finlay
suddenly
looking
up
i
may
know
little
about
women
but
i
know
more
about
advena
murchison
than
that
she
advised
me
in
the
sense
she
thought
right
and
honourable
and
her
advice
was
sincere
and
dr
drummond
deeply
as
i
feel
the
bearing
of
miss
murchison
s
view
of
the
matter
i
could
not
in
any
case
allow
my
decision
to
rest
upon
it
it
must
stand
by
you
mean
that
your
decision
to
marry
to
oblige
your
aunt
should
not
be
influenced
by
the
fact
that
it
means
the
wrecking
of
your
own
happiness
and
that
of
another
person
i
can
t
agree
finlay
i
spoke
first
of
advena
murchison
because
her
part
and
lot
in
it
are
most
upon
my
heart
i
feel
too
that
someone
should
put
her
case
her
own
father
would
never
open
his
lips
if
you
re
to
be
hauled
over
the
coals
about
this
i
m
the
only
man
to
do
it
and
i
m
going
a
look
of
sharp
determination
came
into
the
minister
s
eyes
he
had
the
momentary
air
of
a
small
scotch
terrier
with
a
bidding
finlay
looked
at
him
in
startled
recognition
of
another
possible
phase
of
his
dilemma
he
thought
he
knew
it
in
every
wretched
aspect
it
was
a
bold
reference
of
dr
drummond
s
it
threw
down
the
last
possibility
of
withdrawal
for
finlay
they
must
have
it
out
now
man
to
man
with
a
little
perhaps
even
in
that
unlikely
place
of
penitent
to
confessor
it
was
an
exigency
it
helped
finlay
to
pull
himself
together
and
there
was
something
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
like
the
vibration
of
relief
i
am
pained
and
distressed
more
than
i
have
any
way
of
telling
you
sir
he
said
that
the
state
of
feeling
between
miss
murchison
and
myself
should
have
been
so
plain
to
you
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
that
it
should
be
so
since
it
is
only
very
lately
that
i
have
understood
it
truly
myself
i
hope
you
will
believe
that
it
was
the
strangest
most
unexpected
most
sudden
he
paused
and
looked
timidly
at
the
doctor
he
the
great
fellow
in
straining
bondage
to
his
heart
leaning
forward
with
embarrassed
tension
in
every
muscle
dr
drummond
alert
poised
critical
balancing
his
little
figure
on
the
hearthrug
i
preach
faith
in
miracles
he
said
i
dare
say
between
you
and
her
it
would
be
just
i
have
been
deeply
culpable
common
sense
common
knowledge
of
men
and
women
should
have
warned
me
that
there
might
be
danger
but
i
looked
upon
the
matter
as
our
own
as
between
us
only
i
confess
that
i
have
not
till
now
thought
of
that
part
of
it
but
surely
you
can
not
mean
to
tell
me
that
what
i
have
always
supposed
my
sincere
and
devoted
friendship
for
miss
murchison
has
been
in
any
way
prejudicial
to
her
in
the
ordinary
sense
to
her
prospects
of
marriage
and
her
standing
in
the
eyes
of
the
community
no
finlay
no
i
have
not
heard
the
matter
much
referred
to
you
seem
to
have
taken
none
of
the
ordinary
means
you
have
not
distinguished
her
in
the
eyes
of
gossip
if
you
had
it
would
be
by
no
means
the
gravest
thing
to
consider
such
tokens
are
quickly
forgotten
especially
here
where
attentions
of
the
kind
often
i
ve
noticed
lead
to
nothing
it
is
the
fact
and
not
the
appearance
of
it
that
i
speak
of
that
i
am
concerned
the
fact
is
beyond
mending
said
finlay
dully
aye
the
fact
is
beyond
mending
it
is
beyond
mending
that
advena
murchison
belongs
to
you
and
you
to
her
in
no
common
sense
it
s
beyond
mending
that
you
can
not
now
be
separated
without
such
injury
to
you
both
as
i
would
not
like
to
look
upon
it
s
beyond
mending
finlay
because
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
god
has
made
but
it
is
not
beyond
marring
and
i
charge
you
to
look
well
what
you
are
about
in
connection
with
a
flash
of
happiness
of
simple
delight
lit
the
young
man
s
sombre
eyes
as
the
phrases
fell
to
the
minister
they
were
mere
forcible
words
to
finlay
they
were
soft
rain
in
a
famished
land
then
he
looked
again
heavily
at
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
would
you
have
me
marry
advena
murchison
he
said
with
a
kind
of
shamed
yielding
to
the
words
i
would
and
no
other
man
i
saw
it
from
the
beginning
exclaimed
the
doctor
i
don
t
say
it
isn
t
an
awkward
business
but
at
least
there
ll
be
no
heartbreak
in
scotland
i
gather
you
never
said
a
word
to
the
bross
lady
on
the
subject
and
very
few
on
any
other
you
tell
me
you
left
it
all
with
that
good
woman
your
aunt
to
arrange
after
you
left
do
you
think
a
creature
of
any
sentiment
would
have
accepted
you
on
those
terms
not
she
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
miss
cameron
is
just
a
sensible
wise
woman
that
would
be
the
first
to
see
the
folly
in
this
business
if
she
knew
the
rights
of
it
come
finlay
you
re
not
such
a
great
man
with
the
ladies
you
can
t
pretend
she
has
any
affection
for
the
note
of
raillery
in
the
doctor
s
voice
drew
finlay
s
brows
together
i
don
t
know
he
said
whether
i
have
to
think
of
her
affections
but
i
do
know
i
have
to
think
of
her
dignity
her
confidence
and
her
belief
in
the
honourable
dealing
of
a
man
whom
she
met
under
the
sanction
of
a
trusted
roof
the
matter
may
look
light
here
it
is
serious
there
she
has
her
circle
of
friends
they
are
acquainted
with
her
engagement
she
has
made
all
her
arrangements
to
carry
it
out
she
has
disposed
of
her
life
i
can
not
ask
her
to
reconsider
her
lot
because
i
have
found
a
happier
adjustment
for
finlay
said
dr
drummond
you
will
not
be
known
in
bross
or
anywhere
else
as
a
man
who
has
jilted
a
woman
is
that
it
i
will
not
be
a
man
who
has
jilted
a
there
is
no
sophist
like
pride
look
at
the
case
on
its
merits
on
the
one
side
a
disappointment
for
miss
cameron
i
don
t
doubt
she
s
counting
on
coming
but
at
worst
a
worldly
disappointment
and
the
very
grievous
humiliation
for
you
of
writing
to
tell
her
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
you
deserve
that
finlay
if
you
wouldn
t
be
a
man
who
has
jilted
a
woman
you
have
no
business
to
lend
yourself
to
such
matters
with
the
capacity
of
a
blind
kitten
that
is
the
damage
on
the
one
side
on
the
other
i
know
all
that
there
is
to
be
said
interrupted
finlay
on
the
then
face
it
man
go
home
and
write
the
whole
truth
to
bross
i
ll
do
it
for
you
no
i
won
t
either
stand
up
to
it
yourself
you
must
hurt
one
of
two
women
choose
the
one
that
will
suffer
only
in
her
vanity
i
tell
you
that
scotch
entanglement
of
yours
is
pure
cardboard
farce
it
won
t
stand
examination
it
s
appalling
to
think
that
out
of
an
extravagant
hypersensitive
conception
of
honour
egged
on
by
that
poor
girl
you
could
be
capable
of
turning
it
into
the
reality
of
your
i
ve
taken
all
these
points
of
view
sir
and
i
can
t
throw
the
woman
over
the
objection
to
it
isn
t
in
reason
it
s
somehow
in
the
past
and
the
blood
it
would
mean
the
sacrifice
of
all
that
i
hold
most
valuable
in
myself
i
should
expect
myself
after
that
to
stick
at
nothing
why
should
i
there
is
one
point
of
view
that
perhaps
you
have
not
taken
said
dr
drummond
in
his
gravest
manner
you
are
settled
here
in
your
charge
in
all
human
probability
you
will
remain
here
in
east
elgin
as
i
have
remained
here
building
and
fortifying
the
place
you
have
won
for
the
lord
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
advena
murchison
s
life
will
also
go
on
here
there
is
nothing
to
take
it
away
you
have
both
strong
natures
are
you
prepared
for
that
we
are
both
prepared
for
it
we
shall
both
be
equal
to
it
i
count
upon
her
and
she
counts
upon
me
to
furnish
in
our
friendship
the
greater
part
of
whatever
happiness
life
may
have
in
store
for
then
you
must
be
a
pair
of
born
lunatics
said
dr
drummond
his
jaw
grim
his
eyes
snapping
what
you
propose
is
little
less
than
a
crime
finlay
it
can
come
to
nothing
but
grief
if
no
worse
and
your
wife
poor
woman
whatever
she
deserves
it
is
better
than
that
my
word
if
she
could
choose
her
prospect
think
you
she
would
hesitate
finlay
i
entreat
you
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
prudence
go
home
and
break
it
off
leave
advena
out
of
it
you
have
no
business
to
make
this
marriage
whether
or
no
leave
other
considerations
to
god
and
to
the
future
i
beseech
you
bring
it
to
an
end
finlay
got
up
and
held
out
his
hand
i
tell
you
from
my
heart
it
is
impossible
he
said
i
can
t
move
you
said
dr
drummond
then
let
us
see
if
the
lord
can
you
will
not
object
finlay
to
bring
the
matter
before
him
here
and
now
in
a
few
words
of
prayer
i
should
find
it
hard
to
let
you
go
without
they
went
down
upon
their
knees
where
they
stood
and
dr
drummond
did
little
less
than
order
divine
interference
but
the
prayer
that
was
inaudible
was
to
the
opposite
purpose
ten
minutes
later
the
minister
himself
opened
the
door
to
let
finlay
out
into
the
night
you
will
remember
he
said
as
they
shook
hands
that
what
i
think
of
your
position
in
this
matter
makes
no
difference
whatever
to
the
question
of
your
aunt
s
coming
here
with
miss
cameron
when
they
arrive
you
will
bring
them
to
this
house
as
a
matter
of
course
i
wish
you
could
be
guided
to
a
different
conclusion
but
after
all
it
is
your
own
conscience
that
must
be
satisfied
they
will
be
better
here
than
at
the
murchisons
he
added
with
a
last
shaft
of
reproach
and
they
will
be
very
it
said
much
for
dr
drummond
that
finlay
was
able
to
fall
in
with
the
arrangement
he
went
back
to
his
and
added
a
postscript
embodying
it
to
his
letter
to
bross
then
he
walked
out
upon
the
midnight
two
feverish
miles
to
the
town
and
posted
the
letter
the
way
back
was
longer
and
colder

well
winter
said
octavius
milburn
i
expect
there
s
business
in
this
for
mr
milburn
and
mr
winter
had
met
in
the
act
of
unlocking
their
boxes
at
the
elgin
had
enjoyed
postal
delivery
for
several
years
but
not
so
much
as
to
induce
men
of
business
to
abandon
the
box
that
had
been
the
great
convenience
succeeding
window
inquiry
in
time
the
boxes
would
go
but
the
habit
of
dropping
in
for
your
own
noonday
mail
on
the
way
home
to
dinner
was
and
undoubtedly
you
got
it
earlier
moreover
it
takes
time
to
engender
confidence
in
a
postman
when
he
is
drawn
from
your
midst
and
when
you
know
perfectly
well
that
he
would
otherwise
be
driving
the
mere
or
delivering
the
mere
ice
as
he
was
last
year
looks
like
it
responded
mr
winter
cheerfully
the
boys
have
been
round
as
usual
i
told
them
they
d
better
try
another
shop
this
time
but
they
seemed
to
think
the
old
reliable
was
good
enough
to
go
on
this
exchange
to
anyone
in
elgin
would
have
been
patently
simple
on
that
day
there
was
only
one
serious
topic
in
elgin
and
there
could
have
been
only
one
reference
to
business
for
walter
winter
the
dominion
had
come
up
the
day
before
with
the
announcement
that
mr
robert
farquharson
who
for
an
aggregate
of
eleven
years
had
represented
the
liberals
of
south
fox
in
the
canadian
house
of
commons
had
been
compelled
under
medical
advice
to
withdraw
from
public
life
the
news
was
unexpected
and
there
was
rather
a
feeling
among
mr
farquharson
s
local
support
in
elgin
that
it
shouldn
t
have
come
from
toronto
it
will
be
gathered
that
horace
williams
as
he
himself
acknowledged
was
wild
the
general
feeling
and
to
some
extent
mr
williams
s
was
appeased
by
the
further
information
that
mr
farquharson
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
toronto
to
see
a
specialist
whose
report
he
had
naturally
enough
taken
to
party
headquarters
whence
the
dominion
would
get
it
as
mr
williams
said
by
telephone
or
any
quicker
way
there
was
williams
it
should
be
added
was
well
ahead
with
the
details
as
considerate
as
was
consistent
with
public
enterprise
of
the
retiring
member
s
malady
its
duration
the
date
of
the
earliest
symptoms
and
the
growth
of
anxiety
in
mrs
farquharson
who
had
finally
insisted
and
how
right
she
was
on
the
visit
to
the
specialist
upon
which
she
had
accompanied
mr
farquharson
he
sent
round
rawlins
so
that
elgin
was
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
and
walter
winter
who
had
every
pretension
to
contest
the
seat
again
and
every
satisfaction
that
it
wouldn
t
be
against
farquharson
might
naturally
be
expected
to
be
taken
up
with
them
sufficiently
to
understand
a
man
who
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
in
the
with
the
remark
i
have
quoted
i
guess
they
know
what
they
re
about
returned
mr
milburn
it
s
a
bad
knock
for
the
grits
old
farquharson
having
to
drop
out
he
s
getting
up
in
years
but
he
s
got
a
great
hold
here
he
ll
be
a
dead
loss
in
votes
to
his
party
i
always
said
our
side
wouldn
t
have
a
chance
till
the
old
man
was
out
of
the
mr
winter
twisted
the
across
his
protuberant
waistcoat
and
his
chin
sank
in
reflective
folds
above
his
above
that
again
his
nose
drooped
over
his
moustache
and
his
eyelids
over
his
eyes
which
sought
the
floor
altogether
he
looked
sunk
like
an
overfed
bird
in
deferential
contemplation
of
what
mr
milburn
was
saying
they
ve
nobody
to
touch
him
certainly
in
either
ability
or
experience
he
replied
looking
up
to
do
it
with
a
handsome
air
of
concession
now
that
martin
s
dead
and
jim
fawkes
come
that
howler
over
pink
river
they
ll
have
their
work
cut
out
for
them
to
find
a
man
i
hear
fawkes
takes
it
hard
after
all
he
s
done
for
em
not
to
get
the
nomination
but
they
won
t
hear
of
it
quite
right
too
he
s
let
too
many
people
in
over
that
concession
of
his
to
be
popular
even
among
his
i
suppose
he
has
dropped
anything
there
yourself
no
nor
i
when
a
thing
gets
to
the
boom
stage
i
say
let
it
alone
even
if
there
s
gold
in
it
and
you
ve
got
a
school
of
mines
man
to
tell
you
so
fawkes
came
out
of
it
at
the
small
end
himself
i
expect
but
that
doesn
t
help
him
any
in
the
eyes
of
i
hear
said
walter
winter
stroking
his
nose
that
old
man
parsons
has
come
right
over
since
the
bosses
at
ottawa
have
put
so
much
money
on
preference
trade
with
the
old
country
he
says
he
was
a
liberal
once
and
may
be
a
liberal
again
but
he
doesn
t
see
his
way
to
voting
to
give
his
customers
blankets
cheaper
than
he
can
make
them
and
he
ll
wait
till
the
clouds
roll
he
won
t
be
the
only
one
either
said
milburn
take
my
word
for
it
they
ll
be
dead
sick
and
sorry
over
this
imperial
craze
in
a
year
s
time
every
government
that
s
taken
it
up
the
people
won
t
have
it
the
empire
looks
nice
on
the
map
but
when
it
comes
to
practical
politics
their
bread
and
butter
s
in
the
home
industries
there
s
a
great
principle
at
stake
winter
i
must
say
i
envy
you
standing
up
for
it
under
such
favourable
conditions
liberals
like
young
and
windle
may
talk
big
but
when
it
comes
to
the
you
ll
have
the
whole
manufacturing
interest
of
the
place
behind
you
and
nobody
the
wiser
it
s
a
great
thing
to
carry
the
standard
on
an
issue
above
and
beyond
party
politics
it
s
a
purer
air
my
walter
winter
s
nod
confirmed
the
sagacity
of
this
and
appreciated
the
highmindedness
it
was
a
parting
nod
mr
winter
had
too
much
on
hand
that
morning
to
waste
time
upon
octavius
milburn
but
it
was
full
of
the
qualities
that
ensure
the
success
of
a
man
s
relation
with
his
fellows
consideration
was
in
it
and
understanding
and
that
kind
of
geniality
that
offers
itself
on
a
plain
business
footing
a
commercial
heartiness
that
has
no
nonsense
about
it
he
had
half
a
dozen
casual
chats
like
this
with
mr
milburn
on
his
way
up
main
street
and
his
manner
expanded
in
cordiality
and
respect
with
each
as
if
his
growing
confidence
in
himself
increased
his
confidence
in
his
the
same
assurance
greeted
him
several
times
over
every
friend
wanted
to
remind
him
of
the
enemy
s
exigency
and
to
assure
him
that
the
enemy
s
new
policy
was
enough
by
itself
to
bring
him
romping
in
at
last
and
to
every
assurance
he
presented
the
same
acceptable
attitude
of
desiring
for
particular
reasons
to
take
special
note
of
such
valuable
views
at
the
end
he
had
neither
elicited
nor
imparted
a
single
opinion
of
any
importance
nevertheless
he
was
quite
entitled
to
his
glow
of
satisfaction
among
mr
winter
s
qualifications
for
political
life
was
his
capacity
to
arrive
at
an
estimate
of
the
position
of
the
enemy
he
was
never
persuaded
to
his
own
advantage
he
never
stepped
ahead
of
the
facts
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
him
popular
with
the
other
side
his
readiness
to
do
justice
to
their
equipment
to
acknowledge
their
chances
there
is
gratification
of
a
special
sort
in
hearing
your
points
of
vantage
confessed
by
the
foe
the
vanity
is
soothed
by
his
open
admission
that
you
are
worthy
of
his
steel
it
makes
you
a
little
less
keen
somehow
about
defeating
him
it
may
be
that
mr
winter
had
an
instinct
for
this
or
perhaps
he
thought
such
discourse
more
profitable
if
less
pleasant
than
derisive
talk
in
the
opposite
sense
at
all
events
he
gained
something
and
lost
nothing
by
it
even
in
his
own
camp
where
swagger
might
be
expected
to
breed
admiration
he
was
thought
a
fellow
who
didn
t
expect
miracles
his
forecast
in
most
matters
was
quoted
and
his
defeats
at
the
polls
had
been
to
some
extent
neutralized
by
his
sagacity
in
computing
the
returns
in
advance
so
that
we
may
safely
follow
mr
winter
to
the
conclusion
that
the
liberals
of
south
fox
were
somewhat
put
to
it
to
select
a
successor
to
robert
farquharson
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
keep
the
party
credit
exactly
where
he
found
it
the
need
was
unexpected
and
the
two
men
who
would
have
stepped
most
naturally
into
farquharson
s
shoes
were
disqualified
as
winter
described
the
retirement
came
at
a
calculating
moment
south
fox
still
declared
itself
with
pride
an
unhealthy
division
for
conservatives
but
new
considerations
had
thrust
themselves
among
liberal
counsels
and
nobody
yet
knew
what
the
country
would
say
to
them
the
place
was
a
grit
but
its
steady
growth
as
an
industrial
centre
would
give
a
new
significance
to
the
figures
of
the
next
returns
the
conservative
was
the
manufacturers
party
and
had
been
ever
since
the
veteran
sir
john
macdonald
declared
for
a
protective
national
policy
and
placed
the
plain
issue
before
the
country
which
divided
the
industrial
and
the
agricultural
interests
a
certain
number
of
millowners
mr
milburn
mentioned
young
and
windle
belonged
to
the
liberals
as
if
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
you
inherit
your
party
in
canada
as
you
inherit
your
denomination
or
your
nose
it
accompanies
you
simply
to
the
grave
but
they
were
exceptions
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
other
side
had
been
considerably
strengthened
by
the
addition
of
two
or
three
thriving
and
highly
capitalized
concerns
during
the
past
five
years
upon
the
top
of
this
had
come
the
possibility
of
a
great
and
dramatic
change
of
trade
relations
with
great
britain
which
the
liberal
government
at
ottawa
had
given
every
sign
of
willingness
to
adopt
had
indeed
initiated
and
were
bound
by
word
and
letter
to
follow
up
though
the
moment
had
not
yet
come
might
never
come
for
its
acceptance
or
rejection
by
the
country
as
a
whole
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
every
would
be
concerned
with
the
policy
involved
and
that
every
liberal
candidate
must
be
prepared
to
stand
by
it
in
so
far
as
the
leaders
had
conceived
and
pushed
it
party
feeling
was
by
no
means
unanimous
in
favour
of
the
change
many
liberals
saw
commercial
salvation
closer
in
improved
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
the
new
policy
clothed
as
it
was
in
the
attractive
sentiment
of
loyalty
and
making
for
the
solidarity
of
the
british
race
might
be
depended
upon
to
capture
votes
which
had
been
hitherto
conservative
mainly
because
these
professions
were
supposed
to
be
an
indissoluble
part
of
conservatism
it
was
a
thing
to
split
the
vote
sufficiently
to
bring
an
unusual
amount
of
anxiety
and
calculation
into
liberal
counsels
the
other
side
were
in
no
doubt
or
difficulty
walter
winter
was
good
enough
for
them
and
it
was
their
cheerful
conviction
that
walter
winter
would
put
a
large
number
of
people
wise
on
the
subject
of
preference
trade
who
at
present
only
knew
enough
to
vote
for
it
the
great
question
was
the
practicability
of
the
new
idea
and
how
much
further
it
could
safely
be
carried
in
a
loyal
dominion
which
was
just
getting
on
its
industrial
legs
it
was
debated
with
anxiety
at
ottawa
and
made
the
subject
of
special
instruction
to
south
fox
where
the
would
have
all
the
importance
of
an
early
test
it
s
a
clear
issue
wrote
an
influential
person
at
ottawa
to
the
local
party
leaders
at
elgin
we
don
t
want
any
tendency
to
hedge
or
double
it
s
straight
business
with
us
the
thing
we
want
and
it
will
be
till
wallingham
either
gets
it
through
over
there
or
finds
he
can
t
deal
with
us
meanwhile
it
might
be
as
well
to
ascertain
just
how
much
there
is
in
it
for
platform
purposes
in
a
safe
spot
like
south
fox
and
how
much
the
fresh
opposition
will
cost
us
where
we
can
afford
it
we
can
t
lose
the
seat
and
the
returns
will
be
worth
anything
in
their
bearing
on
the
general
election
next
year
the
objection
to
carter
is
that
he
s
only
he
couldn
t
talk
straight
if
he
wanted
to
and
that
lecture
tour
of
his
in
the
united
states
ten
years
ago
pushing
reciprocity
with
the
americans
would
make
awkward
the
rejection
of
carter
practically
exhausted
the
list
of
men
available
whose
standing
in
the
town
and
experience
of
its
suffrages
brought
them
naturally
into
the
field
of
selection
and
at
this
point
cruickshank
wrote
to
farquharson
suggesting
the
dramatic
departure
involved
in
the
name
of
lorne
murchison
cruickshank
wrote
judiciously
leaving
the
main
arguments
in
lorne
s
favour
to
form
themselves
in
farquharson
s
mind
but
countering
the
objections
that
would
rise
there
by
the
suggestion
that
after
a
long
period
of
confidence
and
steady
going
in
fact
of
the
orthodox
and
expected
the
party
should
profit
by
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
toward
novelty
and
tentative
rather
than
bring
forward
a
candidate
who
would
represent
possibly
misrepresent
the
same
beliefs
and
intentions
on
a
lower
personal
level
as
there
was
no
man
of
the
same
sort
to
succeed
farquharson
cruickshank
suggested
the
undesirability
of
a
man
and
he
did
it
so
adroitly
that
the
old
fellow
found
himself
in
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
with
the
idea
he
had
small
opinion
of
the
lot
that
was
left
for
selection
and
smaller
relish
for
the
prospect
of
turning
his
honourable
activity
over
to
any
one
of
them
force
of
habit
and
training
made
him
smile
at
cruickshank
s
proposition
as
impracticable
but
he
felt
its
attraction
even
while
he
dismissed
it
to
an
inside
pocket
young
murchison
s
name
would
be
so
that
if
he
farquharson
could
succeed
in
imposing
it
upon
the
party
it
would
be
almost
like
making
a
personal
choice
of
his
successor
a
grateful
idea
in
abdication
farquharson
wished
regretfully
that
lorne
had
another
five
years
to
his
credit
in
the
liberal
record
of
south
fox
by
the
time
the
young
fellow
had
earned
them
he
the
retiring
member
would
be
quite
on
the
shelf
if
in
no
completer
oblivion
he
could
not
expect
much
of
a
voice
in
any
nomination
five
years
hence
he
sighed
to
think
of
it
it
was
at
that
point
of
his
meditations
that
mr
farquharson
met
squire
ormiston
on
the
steps
of
the
bank
of
british
north
america
an
building
with
an
appearance
of
dignity
and
probity
a
look
of
having
been
founded
long
ago
upon
principles
which
raised
it
above
fluctuation
exactly
the
place
in
which
mr
farquharson
and
squire
ormiston
might
be
expected
to
meet
the
two
men
though
politically
opposed
were
excellent
friends
they
greeted
cordially
so
you
re
ordered
out
of
politics
farquharson
said
the
squire
we
re
all
sorry
for
that
you
i
m
afraid
so
i
m
afraid
so
thanks
for
your
letter
very
friendly
of
you
squire
i
don
t
like
it
no
use
pretending
i
do
but
it
seems
i
ve
got
to
take
a
rest
if
i
want
to
be
known
as
a
going
a
fellow
with
so
much
influence
in
committee
ought
to
have
more
control
of
his
nerve
centres
ormiston
told
him
the
squire
belonged
to
that
order
of
elderly
gentlemen
who
will
have
their
little
joke
well
have
you
and
bingham
and
horace
williams
made
up
your
minds
who
s
to
have
the
seat
farquharson
shook
his
head
i
only
know
what
i
see
in
the
papers
he
said
the
dominion
is
away
out
with
fawkes
and
the
express
is
about
as
lukewarm
with
carter
as
he
is
with
federated
your
government
won
t
be
obliged
to
you
for
carter
said
mr
ormiston
a
more
scoundrel
was
never
offered
a
commission
in
a
respectable
cause
he
ll
be
the
first
to
rat
if
things
begin
to
look
queer
for
this
new
policy
of
yours
and
wallingham
he
hasn
t
got
it
yet
farquharson
admitted
and
he
won
t
with
my
good
will
so
you
re
with
us
for
preference
trade
ormiston
it
s
a
thing
i
d
like
to
see
it
s
a
thing
i
m
sorry
we
re
not
in
a
position
to
take
up
practically
ourselves
but
you
won
t
get
it
you
know
you
ll
be
defeated
by
the
senior
partner
it
s
too
much
of
a
doctrine
for
the
people
of
england
they
re
listening
to
wallingham
just
now
because
they
admire
him
but
they
won
t
listen
to
you
i
doubt
whether
it
will
ever
come
to
an
issue
over
there
this
time
next
year
wallingham
will
be
sucking
his
thumbs
and
thinking
of
something
else
no
it
s
not
a
thing
to
worry
about
politically
for
it
won
t
come
the
squire
s
words
suggested
so
much
relief
in
that
conviction
that
farquharson
sharp
on
the
flair
of
the
experienced
nose
for
waverers
looked
at
him
observantly
i
m
not
so
sure
it
s
a
doctrine
with
a
fine
practical
application
for
them
as
well
as
for
us
if
they
can
be
got
to
see
it
and
they
re
bound
to
see
it
in
time
it
s
a
thing
i
never
expected
to
live
to
believe
never
thought
would
be
practicable
until
lately
but
now
i
think
there
s
a
very
good
chance
of
it
and
hang
it
all
he
added
it
may
be
unreasonable
but
the
more
i
notice
the
yankees
making
propositions
to
get
us
away
from
it
the
more
i
want
to
see
it
come
i
have
very
much
the
same
feeling
the
squire
acknowledged
i
ve
been
turning
the
matter
over
a
good
deal
since
that
last
conference
showed
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
and
the
fellows
in
your
government
gave
them
a
fine
lead
but
such
a
proposition
was
bound
to
come
from
your
side
the
whole
political
history
of
the
country
shows
it
we
re
pledged
to
take
care
of
the
damned
farquharson
smiled
at
the
note
of
depression
well
we
want
a
bigger
market
somewhere
he
said
with
detachment
and
it
looks
as
if
we
could
get
it
now
uncle
sam
has
had
a
fright
if
the
question
comes
to
be
fought
out
at
the
polls
i
don
t
see
how
your
party
could
do
better
than
go
in
for
a
wide
scheme
of
reciprocity
with
the
americans
in
raw
products
of
course
with
a
tariff
to
match
theirs
on
manufactured
goods
that
would
shut
a
pretty
tight
door
on
british
connection
they
ll
not
get
my
vote
if
they
do
said
the
squire
thrusting
his
hands
fiercely
into
his
breeches
pockets
as
you
say
it
s
most
important
to
put
up
a
man
who
will
show
the
constituency
all
the
credit
and
benefit
there
is
in
it
anyhow
farquharson
observed
i
ve
had
a
letter
this
morning
he
added
laughing
from
a
fellow
one
of
the
bosses
too
who
wants
us
to
nominate
young
the
lawyer
that
s
the
man
he
s
too
young
of
course
not
thirty
but
he
s
well
known
in
the
country
districts
i
don
t
know
a
man
of
his
age
with
a
more
useful
service
record
he
s
got
a
lot
of
friends
and
he
s
come
a
good
deal
to
the
front
lately
through
that
communications
business
we
might
do
worse
and
upon
my
word
we
re
in
such
a
hole
farquharson
said
old
squire
ormiston
the
red
creeping
over
features
that
had
not
lost
in
three
generations
the
lines
of
the
old
breed
i
ve
voted
in
the
conservative
interest
for
forty
years
and
my
father
before
me
we
were
whigs
when
we
settled
in
massachusetts
and
whigs
when
we
pulled
up
stakes
and
came
north
rather
than
take
up
arms
against
the
king
but
it
seemed
decent
to
support
the
government
that
gave
us
a
chance
again
under
the
flag
and
my
grandfather
changed
his
politics
now
confound
it
the
flag
seems
to
be
with
the
whigs
again
for
fighting
purposes
anyhow
and
i
don
t
seem
to
have
any
choice
i
ve
been
debating
the
thing
for
some
time
now
and
your
talk
of
making
that
fine
young
fellow
your
candidate
settles
it
if
you
can
get
your
committee
to
accept
young
murchison
you
can
count
on
my
vote
and
i
don
t
want
to
brag
but
i
think
you
can
count
on
moneida
too
though
it
s
never
sent
in
a
grit
majority
the
men
were
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
bank
and
the
crisp
air
of
autumn
brought
them
both
an
agreeable
tingle
of
enterprise
farquharson
s
buggy
was
tied
to
the
nearest
maple
i
m
going
over
to
east
elgin
to
look
at
my
he
said
get
in
with
me
will
you
as
they
drove
up
main
street
they
encountered
walter
winter
who
looked
after
them
with
a
deeply
considering
eye
old
ormiston
always
had
the
imperial
bee
in
his
bonnet
said
he
chapter
xxiii
alfred
hesketh
was
among
the
first
to
hear
of
lorne
s
nomination
to
represent
the
constituency
of
south
fox
in
the
dominion
parliament
the
milburns
told
him
it
was
dora
who
actually
made
the
communication
the
occasion
was
high
tea
miss
milburn
s
apprehension
about
englishmen
and
late
dinner
had
been
dissipated
in
great
amusement
mr
hesketh
liked
nothing
better
than
high
tea
liked
nothing
so
much
he
came
often
to
the
milburns
after
mrs
milburn
said
she
hoped
he
would
and
pleased
her
extremely
by
the
alacrity
with
which
he
accepted
her
first
invitation
to
stay
to
what
she
described
as
their
very
simple
and
unconventional
meal
later
he
won
her
approval
entirely
by
saying
boldly
that
he
hoped
he
was
going
to
be
allowed
to
stay
it
was
only
in
good
english
society
mrs
milburn
declared
that
you
found
such
freedom
and
confidence
it
reminded
her
of
mrs
emmett
s
saying
that
her
in
london
was
always
at
home
to
lunch
mrs
milburn
considered
a
vague
project
of
informing
a
select
number
of
her
acquaintances
that
she
was
always
at
home
to
high
tea
but
on
reflection
dismissed
it
in
case
an
inconvenient
number
should
come
at
once
she
would
never
have
gone
into
detail
but
since
a
tin
of
sardines
will
only
hold
so
many
i
may
say
for
her
that
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
mr
hesketh
however
wore
the
safe
and
attractive
aspect
of
a
single
exceptional
instance
there
were
always
sardines
enough
for
him
it
will
be
imagined
what
pleasure
mrs
milburn
and
miss
filkin
took
in
his
visits
how
he
propped
up
their
standard
of
behaviour
in
all
things
unessential
which
was
too
likely
to
be
growing
limp
so
far
from
approved
examples
i
think
it
was
a
real
aesthetic
satisfaction
i
know
they
would
talk
of
it
afterward
for
hours
with
sighing
comparisons
of
the
form
of
the
young
men
of
elgin
which
they
called
beside
hesketh
s
quite
outre
it
was
a
favourite
word
with
mrs
milburn
outre
she
used
it
like
a
lorgnette
and
felt
her
familiarity
with
it
a
differentiating
mark
mr
milburn
never
so
susceptible
to
delicate
distinctions
looked
upon
the
young
englishman
with
benevolent
neutrality
dora
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
she
reserved
her
opinion
he
might
be
all
that
he
seemed
and
again
he
might
not
englishmen
were
so
deep
they
might
have
nice
manners
but
they
didn
t
always
act
up
to
them
so
far
as
she
had
noticed
there
was
that
honourable
somebody
who
was
in
jail
even
then
for
trying
to
borrow
money
under
false
pretences
from
the
lorne
when
she
expressed
these
views
to
him
reassured
her
but
she
continued
to
maintain
a
guarded
attitude
upon
mr
hesketh
to
everybody
except
mr
hesketh
himself
it
was
dora
as
i
have
said
who
imparted
the
news
lorne
had
come
over
with
it
in
the
afternoon
still
a
little
dazed
and
unbelieving
in
the
face
of
his
tremendous
luck
helped
by
finding
her
so
readily
credulous
to
thinking
it
reasonably
possible
himself
he
could
not
have
done
better
than
come
to
dora
for
a
correction
of
any
undue
exaltation
that
he
might
have
felt
however
she
supplied
it
in
ten
minutes
by
reminding
him
of
their
wisdom
in
keeping
the
secret
of
their
relations
his
engagement
to
the
daughter
of
a
prominent
conservative
would
not
indeed
have
told
in
his
favour
with
his
party
to
say
nothing
of
the
anomaly
of
mr
milburn
s
unyielding
opposition
to
the
new
policy
i
never
knew
father
so
nearly
bitter
about
anything
dora
said
a
statement
which
left
her
lover
thoughtful
but
undaunted
we
ll
bring
him
round
said
lorne
when
he
sees
that
the
british
manufacturer
can
t
possibly
get
the
better
of
men
on
the
spot
who
know
to
a
nut
the
local
to
which
she
had
responded
oh
lorne
don
t
begin
that
again
and
he
had
gone
away
for
the
first
step
of
preparation
it
s
exactly
what
i
should
have
expected
said
hesketh
when
she
told
him
murchison
is
the
very
man
they
want
he
s
cut
out
for
a
political
success
i
saw
that
when
he
was
in
you
haven
t
been
very
long
in
the
country
mr
hesketh
or
we
shouldn
t
hear
you
saying
that
said
mr
milburn
amicably
it
s
a
very
remarkable
thing
with
us
a
political
party
putting
forward
so
young
a
man
now
with
you
i
expect
a
young
fellow
might
get
in
on
his
rank
or
his
wealth
your
principle
of
nonpayment
of
members
confines
your
selection
more
or
less
i
don
t
say
you
re
not
right
but
over
here
we
do
pay
you
see
and
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
in
the
competition
it
isn
t
a
greater
honour
but
it
s
more
sought
for
i
expect
there
ll
be
a
good
many
sore
heads
over
this
it
s
all
the
more
creditable
to
murchison
said
hesketh
of
course
it
is
a
great
feather
in
his
cap
oh
i
don
t
say
young
murchison
isn
t
a
rising
fellow
but
it
s
foolishness
for
his
party
i
can
t
think
who
is
responsible
for
it
however
they
ve
got
a
pretty
foolish
platform
just
now
they
couldn
t
win
this
seat
on
it
with
any
man
a
lesson
will
be
good
for
father
don
t
you
think
lorne
will
get
in
asked
dora
in
a
tone
of
injury
and
slight
resentment
not
by
a
handful
said
her
father
mr
walter
winter
will
represent
south
fox
in
the
next
session
of
parliament
if
you
ask
my
but
father
returned
his
daughter
with
an
outraged
inflection
you
ll
vote
for
lorne
a
smile
went
round
the
table
discreetest
in
mrs
milburn
i
m
afraid
not
said
mr
milburn
i
m
afraid
not
sorry
to
disoblige
but
principles
are
dora
perceptibly
pouted
mrs
milburn
created
a
diversion
with
preserves
under
cover
of
it
hesketh
asked
is
he
a
great
friend
of
yours
one
of
my
very
greatest
dora
replied
i
know
he
ll
expect
father
to
vote
for
him
it
makes
it
awfully
embarrassing
for
oh
i
fancy
he
ll
understand
said
hesketh
easily
political
convictions
are
serious
things
you
know
friendship
isn
t
supposed
to
interfere
with
them
i
wonder
he
went
on
meditatively
whether
i
could
be
of
any
use
to
murchison
now
that
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
to
stop
till
after
christmas
i
ll
be
on
hand
for
the
fight
i
ve
had
some
experience
i
used
to
canvass
now
and
then
from
oxford
it
was
always
a
tremendous
oh
mr
hesketh
do
really
and
truly
he
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
and
i
should
love
to
see
him
get
in
i
know
his
sister
too
they
re
a
very
clever
family
quite
you
know
but
highly
respected
promise
me
you
i
promise
with
pleasure
and
i
wish
it
were
something
it
would
give
me
more
trouble
to
perform
i
like
murchison
said
hesketh
all
this
transpiring
while
they
were
supposed
to
be
eating
preserves
and
mrs
milburn
and
miss
filkin
endeavoured
to
engage
the
head
of
the
house
in
the
kind
of
easy
allusion
to
affairs
of
the
moment
to
which
mr
hesketh
would
be
accustomed
as
a
form
of
conversation
the
accident
to
the
german
empress
the
marriage
of
one
of
the
rothschilds
the
ladies
were
compelled
to
supply
most
of
the
facts
and
all
of
the
interest
but
they
kept
up
a
gallant
line
of
attack
and
the
young
man
taking
gratified
possession
of
dora
s
eyes
was
extremely
obliged
to
them
hesketh
lost
no
time
in
communicating
his
willingness
to
be
of
use
to
murchison
and
lorne
felt
all
his
old
friendliness
rise
up
in
him
as
he
cordially
accepted
the
offer
it
was
made
with
british
heartiness
it
was
thoroughly
meant
lorne
was
in
his
recognition
of
its
quality
a
certain
aloofness
had
grown
in
him
against
his
will
since
hesketh
had
prolonged
his
stay
in
the
town
difficult
to
justify
impossible
to
define
hesketh
as
hesketh
was
worthily
admirable
as
ever
wholesome
and
agreeable
as
well
turned
out
by
his
conscience
as
he
was
by
his
tailor
it
was
hesketh
in
his
relation
to
his
new
environment
that
seemed
vaguely
to
come
short
this
in
spite
of
an
enthusiasm
which
was
genuine
enough
he
found
plenty
of
things
to
like
about
the
country
it
was
perhaps
in
some
manifestation
of
sensitiveness
that
he
failed
he
had
the
adaptability
of
the
pioneer
among
rugged
conditions
but
he
could
not
mingle
quite
immediately
with
the
essence
of
them
he
did
not
perceive
the
genius
loci
lorne
had
been
conscious
of
this
as
a
kind
of
undefined
grievance
now
he
specified
it
and
put
it
down
to
hesketh
s
isolation
among
ways
that
were
different
from
the
ways
he
knew
you
were
bound
to
notice
that
hesketh
as
a
stranger
had
his
own
point
of
view
his
own
training
to
retreat
upon
i
certainly
liked
him
better
over
there
lorne
told
advena
but
then
he
was
a
part
of
it
he
wasn
t
separated
out
as
he
is
here
he
was
just
one
sort
of
fellow
that
you
admired
and
there
were
lots
of
sorts
that
you
admired
more
over
here
you
seem
to
see
round
him
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
it
difficult
said
his
sister
besides
lorne
confessed
i
expect
it
was
easier
to
like
him
when
you
were
inclined
to
like
everybody
a
person
feels
more
critical
of
a
visitor
especially
when
he
s
had
advantages
he
added
honestly
i
expect
we
don
t
care
about
having
to
acknowledge
em
so
very
much
that
s
what
it
comes
i
don
t
see
them
said
advena
mr
hesketh
seems
well
enough
in
his
way
fairly
intelligent
and
anxious
to
be
pleasant
but
i
can
t
say
i
find
him
a
specially
interesting
or
valuable
interesting
you
wouldn
t
but
valuable
well
you
see
you
haven
t
been
in
england
you
haven
t
seen
them
over
there
crowds
of
em
piling
up
the
national
character
hesketh
s
an
average
and
for
an
average
he
s
high
oh
he
s
a
good
sort
and
he
just
smells
of
he
seems
all
right
in
his
politics
said
john
murchison
filling
his
pipe
from
the
tobacco
jar
on
the
mantelpiece
but
i
doubt
whether
you
ll
find
him
much
assistance
the
way
he
talks
of
folks
over
here
know
their
own
business
they
ve
had
to
learn
it
i
doubt
if
they
ll
take
showing
from
they
might
be
a
good
deal
worse
that
may
be
said
mr
murchison
and
settled
down
in
his
armchair
behind
the
dominion
i
agree
with
father
said
advena
he
won
t
be
any
good
advena
prefers
scotch
remarked
stella
i
don
t
know
he
s
full
of
the
subject
said
lorne
he
can
present
it
from
the
other
the
side
of
the
british
exporter
inquired
his
father
looking
over
the
top
of
the
dominion
with
unexpected
humour
no
sir
though
there
are
places
where
we
might
talk
cheap
overcoats
and
tablecloths
and
a
few
odds
and
ends
like
that
the
side
of
the
loaf
and
the
lot
of
people
there
are
to
eat
it
said
lorne
that
ought
to
make
a
friendly
feeling
and
if
there
s
anything
in
the
sentiment
of
the
scheme
he
added
it
shouldn
t
do
any
harm
to
have
a
good
specimen
of
the
english
people
advocating
it
hesketh
ought
to
be
an
i
wouldn
t
put
too
much
faith
in
the
said
john
murchison
neither
would
i
said
stella
emphatically
mister
alfred
hesketh
may
pass
in
an
english
crowd
but
over
here
he
s
just
an
ignorant
young
man
and
you
d
better
not
have
him
talking
with
his
mouth
at
any
of
your
meetings
tell
him
to
go
and
play
with
walter
i
heard
he
was
asking
at
volunteer
headquarters
the
other
night
remarked
alec
how
long
it
would
be
before
a
man
like
himself
if
he
threw
in
his
lot
with
the
country
could
expect
to
get
nominated
for
a
provincial
what
did
they
tell
him
asked
mr
murchison
when
they
had
finished
their
laugh
i
heard
they
said
it
would
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
size
of
the
and
a
little
on
the
size
of
the
man
remarked
advena
he
said
he
would
be
willing
to
take
a
seat
in
a
legislature
and
work
up
alec
went
on
ontario
for
choice
because
he
thought
the
people
of
this
province
more
there
s
a
representative
committee
being
formed
to
give
the
inhabitants
of
the
a
turkey
dinner
on
thanksgiving
day
said
advena
he
might
begin
with
i
dare
say
he
would
if
anybody
told
him
he
s
just
dying
to
be
taken
into
the
public
service
alec
said
he
s
in
dead
earnest
about
it
he
thinks
this
country
s
a
great
place
because
it
gives
a
man
the
chance
of
a
public
why
is
it
asked
advena
that
when
people
have
no
capacity
for
private
usefulness
they
should
be
so
anxious
to
serve
the
public
oh
come
said
lorne
hesketh
has
an
income
of
his
own
why
should
he
sweat
for
his
living
we
needn
t
pride
ourselves
on
being
so
taken
up
with
getting
ours
a
man
like
that
is
in
a
position
to
do
some
good
and
i
hope
hesketh
will
get
a
chance
if
he
stays
over
here
we
ll
soon
see
how
he
speaks
he
s
going
to
follow
farquharson
at
jordanville
on
thursday
i
wonder
at
farquharson
said
his
father
by
this
time
the
candidature
of
mr
lorne
murchison
was
well
in
the
public
eye
the
express
announced
it
in
a
burst
of
beaming
headlines
with
a
biographical
sketch
and
a
cut
of
its
young
horace
williams
whose
hand
was
plain
in
every
line
apologized
for
the
brevity
of
the
biography
quality
rather
than
quantity
he
said
it
was
all
good
and
time
would
make
it
better
this
did
not
prevent
the
mercury
observing
the
next
evening
that
the
liberal
organ
had
omitted
to
state
the
age
at
which
the
new
candidate
was
weaned
the
toronto
papers
commented
according
to
their
party
bias
but
so
far
as
the
candidate
was
concerned
there
was
lack
of
the
material
of
criticism
if
he
had
achieved
little
for
praise
he
had
achieved
nothing
for
detraction
there
was
no
inconsistent
public
utterance
no
doubtful
transaction
no
scandalous
paper
to
bring
forward
to
his
detriment
when
the
fact
that
he
was
but
years
of
age
had
been
exhausted
in
elaborate
ridicule
little
more
was
available
the
policy
he
championed
however
lent
itself
to
the
widest
discussion
and
it
was
instructive
to
note
how
the
opposition
press
while
continuing
to
approve
the
great
principle
involved
found
material
for
gravest
criticism
in
the
government
s
projected
application
of
it
interest
increased
in
the
south
fox
as
its
first
touchstone
and
gathered
almost
romantically
about
lorne
murchison
as
its
spirited
advocate
it
was
commonly
said
that
whether
he
was
returned
or
not
on
this
occasion
his
political
future
was
assured
and
his
name
was
carried
up
and
down
the
dominion
with
every
new
wind
of
imperial
doctrine
that
blew
across
the
atlantic
he
himself
felt
splendidly
that
he
rode
upon
the
crest
of
a
wave
of
history
however
the
event
appeared
which
was
hidden
beyond
the
horizon
the
great
luck
of
that
buoyant
emotion
of
that
thrilling
suspense
would
be
his
in
a
very
special
way
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
sense
of
crisis
and
among
all
the
conferences
and
calculations
that
armed
him
for
his
personal
struggle
he
would
now
and
then
breathe
in
his
private
soul
choose
quickly
england
like
a
prayer
elgin
rose
to
its
liking
for
the
fellow
and
even
his
political
enemies
felt
a
pride
that
the
town
had
produced
a
candidate
whose
natural
parts
were
held
to
eclipse
the
age
and
experience
of
party
hacks
plenty
of
them
were
found
to
declare
that
lorne
murchison
would
poll
more
votes
for
the
grits
than
any
other
man
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
with
the
saving
clause
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
man
could
poll
quite
enough
this
time
they
professed
to
be
content
to
let
the
issue
have
it
meanwhile
they
congratulated
lorne
on
his
chance
telling
him
that
a
knock
or
two
wouldn
t
do
him
any
harm
at
his
age
walter
winter
who
hadn
t
been
on
speaking
terms
with
farquharson
made
a
point
of
shaking
hands
with
murchison
in
the
publicity
of
the
and
assuring
him
that
he
winter
never
went
into
a
contest
more
confident
of
the
straight
thing
on
the
part
of
the
other
side
such
cavilling
as
there
was
came
from
the
organized
support
of
his
own
party
and
had
little
importance
because
it
did
the
grumblers
fell
into
line
almost
as
soon
as
horace
williams
said
they
would
a
little
oil
one
small
appointment
wrung
from
the
ontario
government
fawkes
i
believe
got
it
and
the
machine
was
again
in
good
working
order
lorne
even
profited
in
the
opinion
of
many
by
the
fact
of
his
youth
with
its
promise
of
energy
and
initiative
since
mr
farquharson
had
lately
been
showing
the
defects
as
well
as
the
qualities
of
age
and
experience
and
the
charge
of
servile
timidity
was
already
in
the
mouths
of
his
critics
the
agricultural
community
took
it
as
usual
with
phlegm
but
there
was
a
distinct
tendency
in
the
bar
at
barker
s
on
to
lay
money
on
the
colt
chapter
xxiv
mr
farquharson
was
to
retain
his
seat
until
the
early
spring
for
the
double
purpose
of
maintaining
his
influence
upon
an
important
commission
of
which
he
was
chairman
until
the
work
should
be
done
and
of
giving
the
imperial
departure
championed
by
his
successor
as
good
a
chance
as
possible
of
becoming
understood
in
the
constituency
it
was
understood
that
the
new
writ
would
issue
for
a
date
in
march
elgin
referred
all
interest
to
that
point
and
prophesied
for
itself
a
lively
winter
another
event
of
importance
less
general
was
arranged
for
the
end
of
february
the
arrival
of
miss
cameron
and
mrs
kilbannon
from
scotland
finlay
had
proposed
an
earlier
date
but
matters
of
business
connected
with
her
mother
s
estate
would
delay
miss
cameron
s
departure
her
arrival
would
be
the
decisive
point
of
another
campaign
he
and
advena
faced
it
without
misgiving
but
there
were
moments
when
finlay
greatly
wished
the
moment
past
their
intimacy
had
never
been
conspicuous
and
their
determination
to
make
no
change
in
it
could
be
carried
out
without
attracting
attention
it
was
very
dear
to
them
that
determination
they
saw
it
as
a
test
as
an
ideal
last
of
all
perhaps
as
an
alleviation
they
were
both
too
much
encumbered
with
ideas
to
move
simply
quickly
on
the
impulse
of
passion
they
looked
at
it
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
glass
and
thought
they
put
it
farther
away
they
believed
that
their
relation
comprised
would
always
comprise
the
best
of
life
it
was
matter
for
discussion
singularly
attractive
they
allowed
themselves
upon
it
wide
scope
in
theory
they
could
speak
of
it
in
the
heroic
temper
without
sadness
or
bitterness
the
thing
was
to
tear
away
the
veil
and
look
fate
in
the
face
the
great
thing
perhaps
was
to
speak
of
it
while
still
they
could
give
themselves
leave
a
day
would
arrive
they
acknowledged
with
averted
eyes
when
dumbness
would
be
more
becoming
meanwhile
mrs
murchison
would
have
found
it
hard
to
sustain
her
charge
against
them
that
they
talked
of
nothing
but
books
and
authors
the
philosophy
of
life
as
they
were
intensely
creating
it
was
more
entrancing
than
any
book
or
any
author
simply
and
definitely
and
to
their
own
satisfaction
they
had
abandoned
the
natural
demands
of
their
state
they
lived
in
its
exaltation
and
were
far
from
accidents
deep
in
both
of
them
was
a
kind
of
protective
nobility
i
will
not
say
it
cost
them
nothing
but
it
turned
the
scenes
between
them
into
comedy
of
the
better
sort
the
kind
that
deserves
the
relief
of
stone
or
bronze
advena
had
she
heard
it
would
have
repelled
dr
drummond
s
warning
with
indignation
if
it
were
so
possible
to
keep
their
friendship
on
an
unfaltering
level
then
with
the
latitude
they
had
what
danger
could
attend
them
later
when
the
social
law
would
support
them
divide
them
protect
them
dr
drummond
suspecting
all
looked
grimly
on
and
from
november
to
march
found
no
need
to
invite
mr
finlay
to
occupy
the
pulpit
of
knox
church
they
had
come
to
full
knowledge
that
night
of
their
long
walk
in
the
dark
together
but
even
then
in
the
rush
and
shock
and
glory
of
it
they
had
held
apart
and
their
broken
avowals
had
crossed
with
difficulty
from
one
to
the
other
the
whole
fabric
of
circumstance
was
between
them
to
realize
and
to
explore
later
surveys
as
we
know
had
not
reduced
it
they
gave
it
great
credit
as
a
barrier
i
suppose
because
it
kept
them
out
of
each
other
s
arms
it
had
done
that
it
was
advena
i
fear
who
insisted
most
that
they
should
continue
upon
terms
of
happy
debt
to
one
another
the
balance
always
changing
the
account
never
closed
and
rendered
she
no
doubt
felt
that
she
might
impose
the
terms
she
had
unconsciously
the
sense
of
greater
sacrifice
and
knew
that
she
had
been
mistress
of
the
situation
long
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
agreed
with
joy
and
with
misgiving
he
saw
with
enthusiasm
her
high
conception
of
their
alliance
but
sometimes
wondered
poor
fellow
whether
he
was
right
in
letting
it
cover
him
he
came
to
the
house
as
he
had
done
before
as
often
as
he
could
and
reproached
himself
that
he
could
not
after
all
come
very
often
that
they
should
discuss
their
relation
as
candidly
as
they
sustained
it
was
perhaps
a
little
peculiar
to
them
so
i
have
laid
stress
on
it
but
it
was
not
by
any
means
their
sole
preoccupation
they
talked
like
tried
friends
of
their
affairs
indeed
after
the
trouble
and
intoxication
of
their
great
understanding
had
spent
itself
it
was
the
small
practical
interests
of
life
that
seemed
to
hold
them
most
one
might
think
that
nature
having
made
them
her
invitation
upon
the
higher
plane
abandoned
them
in
the
very
scorn
of
her
success
to
the
warm
human
commonplaces
that
do
her
work
well
enough
with
the
common
type
mrs
murchison
would
have
thought
better
of
them
if
she
had
chanced
again
to
overhear
i
wouldn
t
advise
you
to
have
it
lined
with
fur
advena
was
saying
the
winter
had
sharply
announced
itself
and
finlay
to
her
reproach
about
his
light
overcoat
had
declared
his
intention
of
ordering
a
the
following
day
and
the
buffaloes
are
all
gone
you
know
thirty
years
ago
she
laughed
you
really
are
not
modern
in
practical
matters
does
it
ever
surprise
you
that
you
get
no
pemmican
for
dinner
and
hardly
ever
meet
an
indian
in
his
feathers
he
looked
at
her
with
delight
in
his
sombre
eyes
it
was
a
new
discovery
her
capacity
for
happily
chaffing
him
only
revealed
since
she
had
come
out
of
her
bonds
to
love
it
was
hard
to
say
which
of
them
took
the
greater
pleasure
in
it
what
is
the
use
of
living
in
canada
if
you
can
t
have
fur
on
your
clothes
he
demanded
you
may
have
a
little
astrakhan
i
would
on
the
collar
and
cuffs
she
said
a
fur
lining
is
too
hot
if
there
happens
to
be
a
thaw
and
then
you
would
leave
it
off
and
take
cold
you
have
all
the
look
she
added
with
a
gravely
considering
glance
at
him
of
a
person
who
ought
to
take
care
of
his
he
withdrew
his
eyes
hurriedly
and
fixed
them
instead
on
his
pipe
he
always
brought
it
with
him
by
her
order
and
advena
usually
sewed
he
thought
as
he
watched
her
that
it
made
the
silences
enjoyable
and
expensive
i
dare
say
too
he
said
yes
more
or
less
alec
paid
fifty
dollars
for
his
and
never
liked
fifty
dollars
ten
pounds
no
vair
for
me
he
declared
by
the
way
mrs
firmin
is
threatening
to
turn
me
out
of
house
and
home
a
married
daughter
is
coming
to
live
with
her
and
she
wants
my
when
does
she
come
the
married
daughter
oh
not
till
the
early
spring
there
s
no
immediate
despair
said
finlay
but
it
is
dislocating
my
books
and
i
had
just
succeeded
in
making
room
for
one
but
you
will
have
to
move
in
any
case
in
the
early
i
suppose
i
will
i
had
i
might
have
remembered
have
you
found
a
house
yet
advena
asked
him
have
you
been
looking
it
was
a
gentle
sensible
reminder
i
m
afraid
i
haven
he
moved
in
his
chair
as
if
in
physical
discomfort
do
you
think
i
ought
so
soon
there
are
always
plenty
of
houses
aren
t
there
not
plenty
of
desirable
ones
do
you
think
you
must
live
in
east
elgin
it
would
be
rather
more
because
there
are
two
semidetached
in
river
street
just
finished
that
look
very
pretty
and
roomy
i
thought
when
i
saw
them
that
one
of
them
might
be
what
you
would
thank
you
he
said
and
tried
not
to
say
it
curtly
they
belong
to
white
the
grocer
river
street
isn
t
east
elgin
but
it
is
that
way
and
it
would
be
a
great
deal
pleasanter
for
for
i
must
consider
that
of
course
you
haven
t
been
in
them
i
should
hope
for
a
bright
and
a
very
private
if
advena
was
aware
of
any
unconscious
implication
the
pair
of
eyes
she
turned
upon
him
showed
no
trace
of
satisfaction
in
it
no
i
haven
t
but
if
i
could
be
of
any
use
i
should
be
very
glad
to
go
over
them
with
you
and
she
stopped
involuntarily
checked
by
the
embarrassment
in
his
face
though
she
had
to
wait
for
his
words
to
explain
it
i
should
be
most
grateful
but
but
might
it
not
be
misunderstood
she
bent
her
head
over
her
work
and
one
of
those
instants
passed
between
them
which
he
had
learned
to
dread
they
were
so
completely
the
human
pair
as
they
sat
together
withdrawn
in
comfort
and
shelter
absorbed
in
homely
matters
and
in
each
other
it
was
easy
to
forget
that
they
were
only
a
picture
a
sham
and
that
the
reality
lay
further
on
in
the
early
spring
it
must
have
been
hard
for
him
to
hear
without
resentment
that
she
was
ready
to
help
him
to
make
a
home
for
that
reality
he
was
fast
growing
instructed
in
women
although
by
a
course
advena
looked
up
possibly
she
said
calmly
and
their
agitation
lay
still
between
them
he
was
silently
angry
the
thing
that
stirred
without
their
leave
had
been
sweet
no
said
advena
i
can
t
go
i
suppose
i
m
sorry
i
should
have
liked
so
much
to
be
of
she
looked
up
at
him
appealingly
and
sudden
tears
came
and
stood
in
her
eyes
and
would
perhaps
have
undone
his
hurt
but
that
he
was
staring
into
the
fire
how
can
you
be
of
use
he
said
almost
irritably
in
such
ways
as
those
they
are
not
important
and
i
am
not
sure
that
for
us
they
are
legitimate
if
you
were
about
to
be
married
he
seemed
to
plunge
at
the
word
i
should
not
wish
either
to
hasten
you
or
to
house
you
i
should
turn
my
back
on
it
all
you
should
have
nothing
from
me
he
went
on
with
a
forced
smile
but
my
blessing
delivered
over
my
i
am
sure
they
are
not
important
she
said
humbly
privately
all
unwilling
to
give
up
her
martyrdom
but
surely
they
are
legitimate
i
would
like
to
help
you
in
every
little
way
i
can
don
t
you
like
me
in
your
life
you
have
said
that
i
may
i
believe
you
think
that
by
taking
strong
measures
one
can
exorcise
things
he
said
that
if
we
could
only
write
out
this
history
of
ours
in
our
hearts
blood
it
would
somehow
no
she
said
but
i
should
like
to
do
it
all
the
you
must
bear
with
me
if
i
refuse
the
heroic
in
little
it
is
even
harder
than
the
he
broke
off
leaning
back
and
looking
at
her
from
under
his
shading
hand
as
if
that
might
protect
him
from
too
complete
a
vision
the
firelight
was
warm
on
her
cheek
and
hair
her
needle
once
again
completed
the
dear
delusion
she
sat
there
his
wife
this
was
an
aspect
he
forbade
but
it
would
return
here
it
was
again
it
is
good
to
have
you
in
my
life
he
said
it
is
also
good
to
recognize
one
s
how
can
you
definitely
lose
me
she
asked
and
he
shook
his
head
i
don
t
know
now
that
i
have
found
you
it
is
as
if
you
and
i
had
been
rocked
together
on
the
tide
of
that
inconceivable
ocean
that
casts
us
upon
life
he
said
dreamily
it
isn
t
friendship
of
ideas
it
s
a
friendship
of
spirit
indeed
i
hope
and
pray
never
wholly
to
lose
you
never
will
she
told
him
how
many
worlds
one
lives
in
as
the
day
goes
by
with
the
different
people
one
cares
for
one
beyond
the
other
concentric
ringing
from
the
heart
yours
comprises
all
the
others
it
lies
the
farthest
out
and
alas
at
present
the
closest
in
she
added
irresistibly
to
the
asking
of
his
eyes
but
she
hurried
on
taking
high
ground
to
remedy
her
indiscretion
i
look
forward
to
the
time
when
this
other
feeling
of
ours
will
become
just
an
idea
as
it
is
now
just
an
emotion
at
which
we
should
try
to
smile
it
is
the
attitude
of
the
and
therefore
not
becoming
to
men
why
should
we
not
being
gods
borrow
their
attitude
said
finlay
i
could
never
kill
it
she
put
her
work
in
her
lap
to
say
by
any
sudden
act
of
violence
it
would
seem
a
kind
of
suicide
while
it
rules
it
is
like
one
s
life
absolute
but
to
isolate
it
to
place
it
beyond
the
currents
from
the
heart
to
look
at
it
and
realize
it
and
conquer
it
for
what
it
is
i
don
t
think
it
need
take
so
very
long
and
then
our
friendship
will
be
beautiful
without
i
sometimes
fear
there
may
not
be
time
enough
in
life
he
said
and
if
i
find
that
i
must
simply
go
to
british
columbia
i
think
those
mining
missions
would
give
a
man
his
chance
against
himself
there
is
splendid
work
to
be
done
there
of
a
kind
that
would
make
it
puerile
to
spend
time
in
she
smiled
as
if
at
a
violent
boy
we
can
do
it
we
can
do
it
here
she
said
may
i
quote
another
religion
to
you
from
purification
there
arises
in
the
yogi
a
thorough
discernment
of
the
cause
and
nature
of
the
body
whereupon
he
loses
that
regard
which
others
have
for
the
bodily
then
if
he
loves
he
loves
in
spirit
and
in
truth
i
look
forward
to
the
time
she
went
on
calmly
when
the
best
that
i
can
give
you
or
you
can
give
me
will
ride
upon
a
i
used
to
feel
more
drawn
to
the
ascetic
achievement
and
its
rewards
he
remarked
thoughtfully
than
i
do
if
i
were
not
a
presbyterian
in
canada
she
told
him
i
would
be
a
buddhist
in
burma
but
i
have
inherited
the
shorter
catechism
i
must
remain
without
the
finlay
smiled
they
are
the
simple
he
said
our
law
makes
wise
the
advena
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
fire
she
was
listening
with
admiration
to
her
heart
she
would
not
be
led
to
consider
esoteric
contrasts
of
east
and
west
isn
t
there
something
that
appeals
to
you
she
said
in
the
thought
of
just
leaving
it
all
unsaid
and
all
undone
a
dear
and
tender
projection
upon
the
future
that
faded
a
lovely
thing
we
turned
away
from
until
one
day
it
was
no
longer
there
charming
he
said
averting
his
eyes
so
that
she
should
not
see
the
hunger
in
them
charming
literature
she
smiled
and
sighed
and
he
wrenched
his
mind
to
the
consideration
of
the
buddhism
of
browning
she
followed
him
obediently
but
the
lines
they
wanted
did
not
come
easily
they
were
compelled
to
search
and
verify
something
lately
seemed
lost
to
them
of
that
kind
of
glad
activity
he
was
more
aware
of
it
than
she
since
he
was
less
occupied
in
the
aesthetic
ecstasy
of
in
the
old
time
before
the
sun
rose
they
had
been
so
conscious
of
realms
of
idea
lying
just
beyond
the
achievement
of
thought
approachable
visible
by
phrases
brokenly
realms
which
they
could
see
closer
when
they
essayed
together
he
constantly
struggled
to
reach
those
enchanted
areas
again
but
they
seemed
to
have
gone
down
behind
the
horizon
and
the
only
inspiration
that
carried
them
far
drew
its
impetus
from
the
poetry
of
their
plight
they
looked
for
verses
to
prove
that
browning
s
imagination
carried
him
bravely
through
lives
and
lives
to
come
and
found
them
to
speculate
whether
in
such
chances
they
might
hope
to
meet
again
and
the
talk
came
back
to
his
difficulties
with
his
board
of
management
and
to
her
choice
of
a
frame
for
the
etching
he
had
given
her
by
his
friend
the
glasgow
impressionist
and
to
their
opinion
of
a
common
acquaintance
and
to
lorne
and
his
prospects
he
told
her
how
little
she
resembled
her
brother
and
where
they
diverged
and
how
and
she
listened
with
submission
and
delight
enchanted
to
feel
his
hand
upon
her
intimate
nature
she
lingered
in
the
hall
while
he
got
into
his
overcoat
and
saw
that
a
glove
was
the
worse
for
wear
would
it
be
the
she
begged
to
let
me
mend
that
as
he
went
out
alone
into
the
winter
streets
he
too
drew
upon
a
pagan
for
his
admonition
what
then
art
thou
doing
here
o
imagination
he
groaned
in
his
private
heart
go
away
i
entreat
thee
by
the
gods
for
i
want
thee
not
but
thou
art
come
again
according
to
thy
old
fashion
i
am
not
angry
with
thee
only
go
away
chapter
xxv
miss
milburn
pressed
her
contention
that
the
suspicion
of
his
desire
would
be
bad
for
her
lover
s
political
prospects
till
she
made
him
feel
his
honest
passion
almost
a
form
of
treachery
to
his
party
she
also
hinted
that
for
the
time
being
it
did
not
make
particularly
for
her
own
comfort
in
the
family
circle
mr
milburn
having
grown
by
this
time
quite
bitter
she
herself
drew
the
excitement
of
intrigue
from
the
situation
which
she
hid
behind
her
pretty
pale
decorous
features
and
never
betrayed
by
the
least
of
her
graceful
gestures
she
told
herself
that
she
had
never
been
so
right
about
anything
as
about
that
affair
of
the
ring
imagine
for
an
instant
if
she
had
been
wearing
it
now
she
would
have
banished
lorne
altogether
if
she
could
as
he
insisted
on
an
occasional
meeting
she
clothed
it
in
mystery
appointing
it
for
an
evening
when
her
mother
and
aunt
were
out
and
answering
his
ring
at
the
door
herself
to
her
family
she
remarked
with
detachment
that
you
saw
hardly
anything
of
lorne
murchison
now
he
was
so
taken
up
with
his
old
election
and
to
hesketh
she
confided
her
fear
that
politics
did
interfere
with
friendship
whatever
he
might
say
he
said
a
good
deal
he
cited
lofty
examples
but
the
only
agreement
he
could
get
from
her
was
the
hope
that
the
estrangement
wouldn
t
be
permanent
but
you
are
going
to
say
something
lorne
she
insisted
talking
of
the
jordanville
meeting
not
much
he
told
her
it
s
the
safest
district
we
ve
got
and
they
adore
old
farquharson
he
ll
do
most
of
the
talking
they
wouldn
t
thank
me
for
taking
up
the
time
farquharson
is
going
to
tell
them
i
m
a
man
and
they
couldn
t
do
better
and
i
ve
practically
only
to
show
my
face
and
tell
them
i
think
so
but
mr
hesketh
will
speak
yes
we
thought
it
would
be
a
good
chance
of
testing
him
he
may
interest
them
and
he
can
t
do
much
harm
lorne
i
should
simply
love
to
go
it
s
your
first
i
ll
take
mr
murchison
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
really
you
are
all
right
i
ll
send
you
farquharson
and
i
are
going
out
to
the
crow
place
to
supper
but
hesketh
is
driving
straight
there
he
ll
be
delighted
to
bring
you
who
wouldn
t
i
shouldn
t
be
allowed
to
go
with
him
alone
said
dora
thoughtfully
well
no
i
don
t
know
that
i
d
approve
of
that
myself
laughed
the
confident
young
man
hesketh
is
driving
mrs
farquharson
and
the
cutter
will
easily
hold
three
isn
t
it
lucky
there
s
sleighing
mother
couldn
t
object
to
that
said
dora
lorne
i
always
said
you
were
the
dearest
fellow
i
ll
wear
a
thick
veil
and
not
a
soul
will
know
not
a
soul
would
in
any
case
said
lorne
it
ll
be
a
jordanville
crowd
you
know
nobody
from
we
don
t
visit
much
in
jordanville
certainly
well
mother
mayn
t
object
she
has
a
great
idea
of
mrs
farquharson
because
she
has
attended
eleven
at
ottawa
and
one
of
them
was
given
held
i
should
say
by
the
princess
i
won
t
promise
you
eleven
said
lorne
but
there
seems
to
be
a
pretty
fair
chance
of
one
or
at
this
she
had
a
tale
for
him
which
charmed
his
ears
i
didn
t
know
where
to
look
she
said
aunt
emmie
you
know
has
a
very
bad
trick
of
coming
into
my
room
without
knocking
well
in
she
walked
last
night
and
found
me
before
the
glass
practising
my
curtsey
i
could
have
killed
her
pretended
she
thought
i
was
dora
would
you
like
me
to
promise
something
he
asked
with
a
mischievous
look
of
course
i
would
i
don
t
care
how
much
you
promise
what
but
already
he
repented
of
his
daring
and
sat
beside
her
suddenly
conscious
and
abashed
nor
could
any
teasing
prevail
to
draw
from
him
what
had
been
on
his
audacious
lips
to
say
social
precedents
are
easily
established
in
the
country
the
accident
that
sent
the
first
liberal
canvasser
for
jordanville
votes
to
the
crow
place
for
his
supper
would
be
hard
to
discover
now
the
fact
remains
that
he
has
been
going
there
ever
since
it
made
a
greater
occasion
than
mrs
crow
would
ever
have
dreamed
of
acknowledging
she
saw
to
it
that
they
had
a
good
meal
of
victuals
and
affected
indifference
to
the
rest
they
must
say
their
say
she
supposed
if
the
occasion
had
one
satisfaction
which
she
came
nearer
to
confessing
than
another
it
was
that
the
two
or
three
substantial
neighbours
who
usually
came
to
meet
the
politicians
left
their
wives
at
home
and
that
she
herself
to
avoid
giving
any
offence
on
this
score
never
sat
down
with
the
men
quite
enough
to
do
it
was
she
would
explain
later
for
her
and
the
hired
girl
to
wait
on
them
and
to
clear
up
after
them
she
and
bella
had
their
bite
afterward
when
the
men
had
hitched
up
and
when
they
could
exchange
comments
of
proud
congratulation
upon
the
inroads
on
the
or
the
pies
so
there
was
no
ill
feeling
and
mrs
crow
having
vindicated
her
dignity
by
shaking
hands
with
the
guests
of
the
evening
in
the
parlour
solaced
it
further
by
maintaining
the
masculine
state
of
the
occasion
in
spite
of
protests
or
entreaties
to
sit
down
opposite
mr
crow
would
have
made
it
ordinary
company
she
passed
the
plates
and
turned
it
into
a
function
she
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
parlour
sofa
when
crow
brought
them
in
out
of
the
nipping
early
dark
of
december
elmore
staying
behind
in
the
yard
with
the
horses
she
sat
on
the
sofa
in
her
best
black
dress
with
the
bead
trimming
on
the
neck
and
sleeves
a
good
deal
pushed
up
and
wrinkled
across
the
bosom
which
had
done
all
that
would
ever
be
required
of
it
when
it
gave
elmore
and
abe
their
start
in
life
her
wiry
hands
were
crossed
in
her
lap
in
the
moment
of
waiting
you
could
tell
by
the
look
of
them
that
they
were
not
often
crossed
there
they
were
strenuous
hands
the
whole
worn
figure
was
strenuous
and
the
narrow
set
mouth
and
the
eyes
which
had
looked
after
so
many
matters
for
so
long
and
even
the
way
the
hair
was
drawn
back
into
a
knot
in
a
fashion
that
would
have
given
a
phrenologist
his
opportunity
it
was
a
different
mrs
crow
from
the
one
that
sat
in
the
midst
of
her
poultry
and
in
the
elgin
market
square
but
it
was
even
more
the
same
mrs
crow
the
sum
of
a
certain
measure
of
opportunity
and
service
an
imperial
figure
in
her
bead
trimming
if
the
truth
were
known
the
room
was
heated
to
express
the
geniality
that
was
harder
to
put
in
words
the
window
was
shut
there
was
a
smell
of
varnish
and
whatever
was
inside
the
suite
of
which
mrs
crow
occupied
the
sofa
enlarged
photographs
very
much
enlarged
of
mr
and
mrs
crow
hung
upon
the
walls
and
one
other
of
a
young
girl
done
in
that
process
which
tells
you
at
once
that
she
was
an
only
daughter
and
that
she
is
dead
there
had
been
other
bereavements
they
were
written
upon
the
silver
which
framed
and
glazed
also
contributed
to
the
decoration
of
the
room
but
you
would
have
had
to
look
close
and
you
might
feel
a
delicacy
mrs
crow
made
her
greetings
with
precision
and
sat
down
again
upon
the
sofa
for
a
few
minutes
conversation
i
m
telling
them
said
her
husband
that
the
sleighin
s
just
held
out
for
them
if
it
ud
been
tomorrow
they
d
have
had
to
come
on
wheels
pretty
soft
travellin
as
it
was
some
places
i
snow
s
come
early
this
year
said
mrs
crow
it
was
an
open
fall
it
has
certainly
mr
farquharson
backed
her
up
about
as
early
as
i
remember
it
i
don
t
know
how
much
you
got
out
here
we
had
a
good
foot
in
bout
the
same
bout
the
same
mr
crow
deliberated
but
it
s
been
layin
light
all
along
over
clayfield
way
ain
t
had
a
pair
of
runners
out
them
makes
a
more
cheerful
winter
mrs
crow
don
t
you
think
when
it
comes
early
remarked
lorne
or
would
you
rather
not
get
it
till
after
christmas
i
don
t
know
as
it
matters
much
out
here
in
the
country
we
don
t
get
a
great
many
folks
passin
best
of
times
an
it
s
more
of
a
job
to
take
care
of
the
that
s
so
mr
crow
told
them
chores
come
heavier
when
there
s
snow
on
the
ground
a
great
sight
especially
if
there
s
and
for
an
instant
with
his
knotted
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
he
pondered
this
unvarying
aspect
of
his
yearly
experience
they
all
pondered
it
sympathetic
well
now
mr
farquharson
mrs
crow
turned
to
him
an
how
reely
be
ye
we
ve
heard
better
an
worse
an
middlin
there
s
ben
such
contradictory
oh
very
well
mrs
crow
never
better
i
m
going
to
give
a
lot
more
trouble
yet
i
can
t
do
it
in
politics
that
s
the
worst
of
it
but
here
s
the
man
that
s
going
to
do
it
for
me
here
s
the
man
the
crows
looked
at
the
pretendant
as
in
duty
bound
but
not
any
longer
than
they
could
help
why
i
guess
you
were
at
school
with
elmore
said
crow
as
if
the
idea
had
just
struck
him
he
may
be
right
peart
for
all
that
said
elmore
s
mother
and
elmore
himself
entering
with
two
leading
liberals
of
jordanville
effected
a
diversion
under
cover
of
which
mrs
crow
escaped
to
superintend
with
bella
the
last
touches
to
the
supper
in
the
kitchen
politics
in
and
about
jordanville
were
accepted
as
a
purely
masculine
interest
if
you
had
asked
mrs
crow
to
take
a
hand
in
them
she
would
have
thanked
you
with
sarcasm
and
said
she
thought
she
had
about
enough
to
do
as
it
was
the
on
the
night
of
such
a
meeting
as
this
was
recognized
to
be
no
place
for
ladies
it
was
a
man
s
affair
left
to
the
men
and
the
appearance
there
of
the
other
sex
would
have
been
greeted
with
remark
and
levity
elgin
as
we
know
was
more
sophisticated
in
every
way
plenty
of
ladies
attended
political
meetings
in
the
drill
shed
where
seats
as
likely
as
not
would
be
reserved
for
them
plenty
of
handkerchiefs
waved
there
for
the
encouragement
of
the
hero
of
the
evening
they
did
not
kiss
him
british
phlegm
so
far
had
stayed
that
demonstration
at
the
southern
border
the
ladies
of
elgin
however
drew
the
line
somewhere
drew
it
at
country
meetings
mrs
farquharson
went
with
her
husband
because
since
his
state
of
health
had
handed
him
over
to
her
more
than
ever
she
saw
it
a
part
of
her
wifely
duty
his
retirement
had
been
decided
upon
for
the
spring
but
she
would
be
on
hand
to
retire
him
at
any
earlier
moment
should
the
necessity
arise
we
ll
be
the
only
female
creatures
there
my
dear
she
had
said
to
dora
on
the
way
out
and
hesketh
had
praised
them
both
for
public
spirit
he
didn
t
know
he
said
how
anybody
would
get
elected
in
england
without
the
ladies
especially
in
the
villages
where
the
people
were
obliged
to
listen
respectfully
i
wonder
you
can
afford
to
throw
away
all
the
influence
you
get
in
the
rural
districts
with
soup
and
blankets
he
said
but
this
is
an
extravagant
country
in
many
dora
kept
silence
not
being
sure
of
the
social
prestige
bound
up
with
the
distribution
of
soup
and
blankets
but
mrs
farquharson
set
him
sharply
right
i
guess
we
d
rather
do
without
our
influence
if
it
came
to
that
she
said
hesketh
listened
with
deference
to
her
account
of
the
rural
district
which
had
as
yet
produced
no
ladies
bountiful
made
mental
notes
of
several
points
and
placed
her
privately
as
a
woman
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
i
have
always
claimed
for
hesketh
an
open
mind
he
was
filling
it
now
to
its
capacity
with
care
and
satisfaction
the
schoolroom
was
full
and
waiting
when
they
arrived
jordanville
had
been
well
billed
and
the
posters
held
in
addition
to
the
conspicuous
names
of
farquharson
and
murchison
that
of
mr
alfred
hesketh
of
london
england
there
was
a
to
give
to
the
retiring
member
there
was
a
critical
inspection
to
make
of
the
new
candidate
and
there
was
mr
alfred
hesketh
of
london
england
and
whatever
he
might
signify
they
were
big
quiet
expectant
fellows
with
less
sophistication
and
polemic
than
their
american
counterparts
less
stolid
aggressiveness
than
their
parallels
in
england
if
they
have
parallels
there
they
stood
indeed
for
the
development
between
the
two
they
came
of
the
new
country
but
not
of
the
new
light
they
were
democrats
who
had
never
thrown
off
the
monarch
what
harm
did
he
do
there
overseas
they
had
the
air
of
being
prosperous
but
not
prosperous
enough
for
theories
and
doctrines
the
liberal
vote
of
south
fox
had
yet
to
be
split
by
socialism
or
labour
life
was
a
decent
rough
business
that
required
all
their
attention
there
was
time
enough
for
sleep
but
not
much
for
speculation
they
sat
leaning
forward
with
their
hats
dropped
between
their
knees
more
with
the
air
of
big
schoolboys
expecting
an
entertainment
than
responsible
electors
come
together
to
approve
their
party
s
choice
they
had
the
uncomplaining
bucolic
look
but
they
wore
it
with
a
difference
the
difference
by
this
time
was
enough
to
mark
them
of
another
nation
most
of
them
had
driven
to
the
meeting
it
was
not
an
adjournment
from
the
public
house
nor
did
the
air
hold
any
hint
of
beer
where
it
had
an
alcoholic
drift
the
flavour
was
of
whisky
but
the
stimulant
of
the
occasion
had
been
tea
or
cider
and
the
room
was
full
of
patient
good
will
the
preliminaries
were
gone
through
with
promptness
the
chair
had
supped
with
the
speakers
and
mr
crow
had
given
him
a
friendly
hint
that
the
boys
wouldn
t
be
expecting
much
in
the
way
of
trimmings
from
him
stamping
and
clapping
from
the
back
benches
greeted
mr
farquharson
it
diminished
grew
more
subdued
as
it
reached
the
front
the
young
fellows
were
mostly
at
the
back
and
the
power
of
demonstration
had
somehow
ebbed
in
the
old
ones
the
retiring
member
addressed
his
constituents
for
half
an
hour
he
was
standing
before
them
as
their
representative
for
the
last
time
and
it
was
natural
to
look
back
and
note
the
milestones
behind
the
changes
for
the
better
with
which
he
could
fairly
claim
association
they
were
matters
of
federal
business
chiefly
beyond
the
immediate
horizon
of
jordanville
but
farquharson
made
them
a
personal
interest
for
that
hour
at
all
events
and
there
were
one
or
two
points
of
educational
policy
which
he
could
illustrate
by
their
own
schoolhouse
he
approached
them
as
he
had
always
done
on
the
level
of
mutual
friendly
interest
and
in
the
hope
of
doing
mutual
friendly
business
you
know
and
i
know
he
said
more
than
once
they
and
he
knew
a
number
of
things
together
he
was
afraid
he
said
that
if
the
doctors
hadn
t
chased
him
out
of
politics
he
never
would
have
gone
now
however
that
they
gave
him
no
choice
he
was
glad
to
think
that
though
times
had
been
pretty
good
for
the
farmers
of
south
fox
all
through
the
eleven
years
of
his
appearance
in
the
political
arena
he
was
leaving
it
at
a
moment
when
they
promised
to
be
better
still
already
he
was
sure
they
were
familiar
with
the
main
heads
of
that
attractive
prospect
and
agreeable
as
the
subject
great
as
the
policy
was
to
him
he
would
leave
it
to
be
further
unfolded
by
the
gentleman
whom
they
all
hoped
to
enlist
in
the
cause
as
his
successor
for
this
constituency
mr
lorne
murchison
and
by
his
friend
from
the
old
country
mr
alfred
hesketh
he
farquharson
would
not
take
the
words
out
of
the
mouths
of
these
gentlemen
much
as
he
envied
them
the
opportunity
of
uttering
them
the
french
academy
he
told
them
that
illustrious
body
of
literary
and
scientific
men
had
a
custom
on
the
death
of
a
member
and
the
selection
of
his
successor
of
appointing
one
of
their
number
to
eulogize
the
newcomer
the
person
upon
whom
the
task
would
most
appropriately
fall
did
circumstances
permit
would
be
the
departing
academician
in
this
case
he
was
happy
to
say
circumstances
did
permit
his
political
funeral
was
still
far
enough
off
to
enable
him
to
express
his
profound
confidence
in
and
his
hearty
admiration
of
the
young
and
vigorous
political
heir
whom
the
liberals
of
south
fox
had
selected
to
stand
in
his
shoes
mr
farquharson
proceeded
to
give
his
grounds
for
this
confidence
and
admiration
reminding
the
jordanville
electors
that
they
had
met
mr
murchison
as
a
liberal
in
the
last
general
election
when
he
farquharson
had
to
acknowledge
very
valuable
services
on
mr
murchison
s
part
the
retiring
member
then
thanked
his
audience
for
the
kind
attention
and
support
they
had
given
him
for
so
many
years
made
a
final
cheerful
joke
about
a
pagan
divinity
known
as
anno
domini
and
took
his
seat
they
applauded
him
and
it
was
plain
that
they
regretted
him
the
tried
friend
the
man
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
whose
convictions
they
had
repeated
and
whose
speeches
in
parliament
they
had
read
with
a
kind
of
proprietorship
for
so
long
the
chair
had
to
wait
before
introducing
mr
alfred
hesketh
until
the
backbenchers
had
got
through
with
a
double
rendering
of
for
he
s
a
jolly
good
fellow
which
bolder
spirits
sent
lustily
forth
from
the
anteroom
where
the
little
girls
kept
their
hats
and
comforters
interspersed
with
whoops
hesketh
it
had
been
arranged
should
speak
next
and
lorne
last
mr
hesketh
left
his
wooden
chair
with
smiling
ease
the
ease
which
is
intended
to
level
distinctions
and
put
everybody
concerned
on
the
best
of
terms
he
said
that
though
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
work
of
political
campaigns
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
had
the
privilege
of
addressing
a
colonial
audience
i
consider
said
he
handsomely
that
it
is
a
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
threw
out
his
chest
opinions
have
differed
in
england
as
to
the
value
of
the
colonies
and
the
consequence
of
colonials
i
say
here
with
pride
that
i
have
ever
been
among
those
who
insist
that
the
value
is
very
high
and
the
consequence
very
great
the
fault
is
common
to
humanity
but
we
are
i
fear
in
england
too
prone
to
be
led
away
by
appearances
and
to
forget
that
under
a
rough
unpolished
exterior
may
beat
virtues
which
are
the
brightest
ornaments
of
civilization
that
in
the
virgin
fields
of
the
possessions
which
the
good
swords
of
our
ancestors
wrung
for
us
from
the
algonquins
and
the
and
the
other
savages
may
be
hidden
the
most
glorious
period
of
the
british
mr
hesketh
paused
and
coughed
his
audience
neglected
the
opportunity
for
applause
but
he
had
their
undivided
attention
they
were
looking
at
him
and
listening
to
him
these
canadian
farmers
with
curious
interest
in
his
attitude
his
appearance
his
inflection
his
whole
personality
as
it
offered
itself
to
them
it
was
a
thing
new
and
strange
far
out
in
the
northwest
where
the
emigrant
trains
had
been
unloading
all
the
summer
hesketh
s
would
have
been
a
voice
from
home
but
here
in
ontario
men
had
forgotten
the
sound
of
it
with
many
other
things
they
listened
in
silence
weighing
with
folded
arms
appraising
with
chin
in
hand
they
were
slow
equitable
men
if
we
in
england
hesketh
proceeded
required
a
lesson
as
perhaps
we
did
in
the
importance
of
the
colonies
we
had
it
need
i
remind
you
in
the
course
of
the
late
protracted
campaign
in
south
africa
then
did
the
mother
country
indeed
prove
the
loyalty
and
devotion
of
her
colonial
sons
then
were
envious
nations
compelled
to
see
the
spectacle
of
canadians
and
australians
rallying
about
the
common
flag
eager
to
attest
their
affection
for
it
with
their
and
to
demonstrate
that
they
too
were
worthy
to
add
deeds
to
british
traditions
and
victories
to
the
british
still
no
mark
of
appreciation
hesketh
began
to
think
them
an
unhandsome
lot
he
stood
bravely
however
by
the
note
he
had
sounded
he
dilated
on
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
it
had
been
to
the
people
of
england
to
receive
this
mark
of
attachment
from
dominions
and
dependencies
on
the
cementing
of
the
bonds
of
brotherhood
by
the
blood
of
the
fallen
on
the
impossibility
that
the
mother
country
should
ever
forget
such
voluntary
sacrifices
for
her
sake
when
unexpectedly
and
irrelevantly
from
the
direction
of
the
cloakroom
came
the
expressive
comment
yah
though
brief
nothing
could
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
and
hesketh
sacrificed
several
effective
points
to
hurry
to
the
quotation
what
should
they
know
of
england
who
only
england
know
which
he
could
not
perhaps
have
been
expected
to
forbear
his
audience
however
were
plainly
not
in
the
vein
for
compliment
the
same
voice
from
the
anteroom
inquired
ironically
that
so
and
the
speaker
felt
advised
to
turn
to
more
immediate
considerations
he
said
he
had
had
the
great
pleasure
on
his
arrival
in
this
country
to
find
a
political
party
the
party
in
power
their
canadian
liberal
party
taking
initiative
in
a
cause
which
he
was
sure
they
all
had
at
heart
the
strengthening
of
the
bonds
between
the
colonies
and
the
mother
country
he
congratulated
the
liberal
party
warmly
upon
having
shown
themselves
capable
of
this
great
function
a
point
at
which
he
was
again
interrupted
and
he
recapitulated
some
of
the
familiar
arguments
about
the
desirability
of
closer
union
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
army
of
the
admiralty
and
from
one
which
would
come
home
he
knew
to
all
of
them
the
necessity
of
a
dependable
food
supply
for
the
mother
country
in
time
of
war
here
he
quoted
a
noble
lord
he
said
that
he
believed
no
definite
proposals
had
been
made
and
he
did
not
understand
how
any
definite
proposals
could
be
made
for
his
part
if
the
new
arrangement
was
to
be
in
the
nature
of
a
bargain
he
would
prefer
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
england
he
said
loftily
has
no
wish
to
buy
the
loyalty
of
her
colonies
nor
i
hope
has
any
colony
the
desire
to
offer
her
allegiance
at
the
price
of
preference
in
british
markets
even
proposals
for
mutual
commercial
benefit
may
be
underpinned
i
am
glad
to
say
by
loftier
principles
than
those
of
the
and
the
at
this
one
of
his
hearers
unacquainted
with
the
higher
commercial
plane
exclaimed
how
be
ye
goin
to
get
em
kept
to
then
hesketh
took
up
the
question
he
said
a
friend
in
the
audience
asked
how
they
were
to
ensure
that
such
arrangements
would
be
adhered
to
his
answer
was
in
the
words
of
the
duke
of
dartmoor
by
the
mutual
esteem
the
inherent
integrity
and
the
willing
compromise
of
the
british
here
someone
on
the
back
benches
impatient
doubtless
at
his
own
incapacity
to
follow
this
high
doctrine
exclaimed
intemperately
oh
shut
up
and
the
gathering
remembering
that
this
after
all
was
not
what
it
had
come
for
began
to
hint
that
it
had
had
enough
in
intermittent
stamps
and
uncompromising
shouts
for
murchison
hesketh
kept
on
his
legs
however
a
few
minutes
longer
he
had
a
trenchant
sentence
to
repeat
to
them
which
he
thought
they
would
take
as
a
direct
message
from
the
distinguished
nobleman
who
had
uttered
it
the
marquis
of
aldeburgh
was
the
father
of
the
pithy
thing
which
he
had
presented
as
it
happened
to
hesketh
himself
the
audience
received
it
with
respect
hesketh
s
own
respect
was
so
marked
but
with
misapprehension
there
had
been
too
many
allusions
to
the
nobility
for
a
community
so
far
removed
from
its
soothing
influence
had
ye
no
friends
among
the
commoners
suddenly
spoke
up
a
dry
old
fellow
stroking
a
long
white
beard
and
the
roar
that
greeted
this
showed
the
sense
of
the
meeting
hesketh
closed
with
assurances
of
the
admiration
and
confidence
he
felt
toward
the
candidate
proposed
to
their
suffrages
by
the
liberal
party
that
were
quite
inaudible
and
sought
his
yellow
pinewood
schoolroom
chair
with
rather
a
forced
smile
it
had
been
used
once
before
that
day
to
isolate
conspicuous
stupidity
they
were
at
bottom
a
and
a
loyal
crowd
and
they
had
not
after
all
come
there
to
make
trouble
or
mr
alfred
hesketh
might
have
carried
away
a
worse
opinion
of
them
as
it
was
young
murchison
whose
address
occupied
the
rest
of
the
evening
succeeded
in
making
an
impression
upon
them
distinct
enough
happily
for
his
personal
influence
to
efface
that
of
his
friend
he
did
it
by
the
simple
expedient
of
talking
business
and
as
high
prices
for
produce
and
low
ones
for
agricultural
implements
would
be
more
interesting
there
than
here
i
will
not
report
him
he
and
mr
farquharson
waited
after
the
meeting
for
a
personal
word
with
a
good
many
of
those
present
but
it
was
suggested
to
hesketh
that
the
ladies
might
be
tired
and
that
he
had
better
get
them
home
without
unnecessary
delay
mrs
farquharson
had
less
comment
to
offer
during
the
drive
home
than
hesketh
thought
might
be
expected
from
a
woman
of
her
intelligence
but
miss
milburn
was
very
enthusiastic
she
said
he
had
made
a
lovely
speech
and
she
wished
her
father
could
have
heard
it
a
personal
impression
during
a
time
of
political
excitement
travels
unexpectedly
far
a
week
later
mr
hesketh
was
concernedly
accosted
in
main
street
by
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
say
mister
how
s
the
dook
what
duke
asked
hesketh
puzzled
oh
any
dook
responded
the
boy
and
bicycled
cheerfully
away
chapter
xxvi
christmas
came
and
went
dr
drummond
had
long
accepted
the
innovation
of
a
service
on
christmas
day
as
he
agreed
to
the
anthem
while
the
collection
was
being
taken
up
to
flowers
about
the
pulpit
and
to
the
habit
of
sitting
at
prayer
he
was
a
progressive
by
his
business
instinct
in
everything
but
theology
where
perhaps
his
business
instinct
also
operated
the
other
way
in
favour
of
the
sure
thing
the
christmas
day
service
soon
became
one
of
those
special
occasions
so
dear
to
his
heart
which
made
a
demand
upon
him
out
of
the
ordinary
way
he
rose
to
these
on
the
wing
of
the
eagle
and
his
congregation
never
lacked
the
lesson
that
could
be
most
dramatically
drawn
from
them
his
christmas
day
discourse
gathered
everything
into
it
that
could
emphasize
the
anniversary
including
a
vigorous
attack
upon
the
saints
days
and
ceremonies
of
the
church
of
england
calculated
to
correct
the
concession
of
the
service
and
pull
up
sharply
any
who
thought
that
presbyterianism
was
giving
way
to
the
spurious
attractions
of
sentimentality
or
ritual
the
special
easter
service
with
every
appropriate
feature
of
hymn
and
invocation
was
apt
to
be
marked
by
an
unsparing
denunciation
of
the
pageants
and
practices
of
the
church
of
rome
balance
was
thus
preserved
and
principle
relentlessly
indicated
dr
drummond
loved
as
i
have
said
all
that
asked
for
notable
comment
the
poet
and
the
tragedian
in
him
caught
at
the
opportunity
and
revelled
in
it
public
events
carried
him
far
especially
if
they
were
disastrous
but
what
he
most
profited
by
was
the
dealing
of
providence
with
members
of
his
own
congregation
of
all
the
occasions
that
inspired
him
the
funeral
sermon
was
his
happiest
opportunity
nor
was
it
in
his
hands
by
any
means
unstinted
eulogy
candid
was
his
behind
the
decent
veil
the
accepted
apology
of
death
he
was
not
afraid
to
refer
to
the
follies
of
youth
or
the
weaknesses
of
age
in
terms
as
unmistakable
as
they
were
kindly
grace
he
said
once
of
an
estimable
plain
spinster
who
had
passed
away
did
more
for
her
than
ever
nature
had
he
repeated
it
too
she
was
far
more
indebted
i
say
to
grace
than
to
nature
and
before
his
sharp
earnestness
none
were
seen
to
smile
nor
could
you
forget
the
note
in
his
voice
when
the
loss
he
deplored
was
that
of
a
youth
of
virtue
and
promise
or
that
of
a
personal
friend
his
very
text
would
be
a
blow
upon
the
heart
the
eyes
filled
from
the
beginning
people
would
often
say
that
they
were
sorry
for
the
family
sitting
through
dr
drummond
s
celebration
of
their
bereavement
and
the
sympathy
was
probably
well
founded
but
how
fine
he
was
when
he
paid
the
last
tribute
to
that
upright
man
his
elder
and
david
davidson
how
his
words
marched
sorrowing
to
the
close
much
i
have
said
of
him
and
more
than
he
would
have
had
me
will
it
not
stay
with
those
who
heard
it
till
the
very
end
the
trenchant
mournful
fall
of
that
more
than
he
would
have
had
me
say
it
was
a
thing
that
hugh
finlay
could
not
abide
in
dr
drummond
as
the
winter
passed
the
little
doctor
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
his
hands
off
the
great
political
issue
of
the
year
bound
up
as
it
was
in
the
tenets
of
his
own
politics
which
he
held
only
less
uncompromisingly
than
those
of
the
shorter
catechism
it
was
unfortunately
for
him
a
gradual
and
peaceful
progress
of
opinion
marked
by
no
dramatic
incidents
and
analogy
was
hard
to
find
in
either
testament
for
a
change
of
fiscal
policy
based
on
imperial
advantage
dr
drummond
liked
a
pretty
definite
parallel
he
had
small
opinion
of
the
practice
of
drawing
a
pint
out
of
a
thimble
as
he
considered
finlay
must
have
done
when
he
preached
the
gospel
of
imperialism
from
deuteronomy
xxx
but
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
do
moreover
to
preach
politics
in
knox
church
was
a
liberty
in
finlay
the
fact
that
finlay
had
been
beforehand
with
him
operated
perhaps
to
reconcile
the
doctor
to
his
difficulty
and
the
candidature
of
one
of
his
own
members
in
what
was
practically
the
imperial
interest
no
doubt
increased
his
embarrassment
nevertheless
he
would
not
lose
sight
of
the
matter
for
more
than
two
or
three
weeks
together
many
an
odd
blow
he
delivered
for
its
furtherance
by
way
of
illustrating
higher
things
and
he
kept
it
always
so
to
speak
in
the
practical
politics
of
the
long
prayer
it
was
sunday
evening
and
abby
and
her
husband
as
usual
had
come
to
tea
the
family
was
complete
with
the
exception
of
lorne
who
had
driven
out
to
clayfield
with
horace
williams
to
talk
over
some
urgent
matters
with
persons
whom
he
would
meet
at
supper
at
the
metropole
hotel
at
clayfield
it
was
a
thing
mrs
murchison
thought
little
short
of
scandalous
supper
to
talk
business
on
the
sabbath
day
and
in
a
hotel
a
place
of
which
the
smell
about
the
door
was
enough
to
knock
you
down
even
on
a
weekday
mrs
murchison
considered
and
did
not
scruple
to
say
so
that
politics
should
be
left
alone
on
sundays
clayfield
votes
might
be
very
important
but
there
were
such
things
as
commandments
she
supposed
it
ll
bring
no
blessing
she
declared
severely
eyeing
lorne
s
empty
place
the
talk
about
the
lamplit
table
was
nevertheless
all
of
the
election
blessed
or
unblessed
it
was
not
in
human
nature
that
it
shouldn
t
be
as
mrs
murchison
would
have
very
quickly
told
you
if
you
had
found
her
inconsistent
there
was
reason
in
all
things
as
she
frequently
said
i
hear
alec
had
told
them
that
octavius
milburn
is
going
around
bragging
he
s
got
the
elgin
chamber
of
commerce
consolidated
this
against
us
exclaimed
stella
and
her
brother
said
of
course
those
milburns
remarked
mrs
murchison
are
enough
to
make
one
s
blood
boil
i
met
mrs
milburn
in
the
market
yesterday
she
d
been
pricing
mrs
crow
s
ducks
and
they
were
just
five
cents
too
dear
for
her
and
she
stopped
wonderful
thing
for
her
and
had
such
an
amount
to
say
about
lorne
and
the
honour
it
was
and
the
dear
only
knows
what
butter
wouldn
t
melt
in
her
mouth
and
octavius
milburn
doing
all
he
knew
against
him
the
whole
time
that
s
the
milburns
i
cut
her
remarkably
short
mrs
murchison
added
with
satisfaction
and
when
she
d
made
up
her
mind
she
d
have
to
give
that
extra
five
cents
for
the
ducks
because
there
weren
t
any
others
to
be
had
she
went
back
and
found
i
d
bought
well
done
mother
said
alec
and
oliver
remarked
that
if
those
were
today
s
ducks
they
were
too
good
for
the
milburn
crowd
a
lot
i
expect
she
wanted
them
too
remarked
stella
they
ve
got
the
only
mr
hesketh
staying
with
them
now
miss
filkin
s
in
a
great
state
of
i
guess
we
can
spare
them
hesketh
said
john
murchison
he
s
a
lobster
said
stella
with
fervour
he
seems
to
bring
a
frost
where
he
goes
continued
abby
s
husband
in
politics
anyhow
i
hear
lorne
wants
to
make
a
present
of
him
to
the
other
side
for
use
wherever
they
ll
let
him
speak
longest
is
it
true
he
began
his
speech
out
at
jordanville
gentlemen
and
those
of
you
who
are
not
gentlemen
could
he
have
meant
mrs
farquharson
and
miss
milburn
asked
mr
murchison
quietly
when
the
derision
subsided
and
they
laughed
again
he
told
me
said
advena
that
he
proposed
to
convert
mr
milburn
to
the
imperial
he
ll
have
his
job
cut
out
for
him
said
her
father
for
my
part
abby
told
them
i
think
the
milburns
are
beneath
contempt
you
don
t
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
there
s
something
about
them
not
that
we
ever
come
in
contact
with
them
she
continued
with
dignity
i
believe
they
used
to
be
patients
of
dr
henry
s
till
he
got
up
in
years
but
they
don
t
call
in
maybe
that
s
what
there
is
about
them
said
mr
murchison
innocently
father
s
made
up
his
mind
announced
dr
harry
and
they
waited
breathless
there
could
be
only
one
point
upon
which
dr
henry
could
be
dubitating
at
that
moment
he
s
going
to
vote
for
he
s
a
lovely
old
darling
cried
stella
good
for
dr
henry
johnson
i
knew
he
the
rest
were
silent
with
independence
and
gratification
dr
henry
s
conservatism
had
been
supposed
to
be
invincible
dr
harry
they
thought
a
fair
prey
to
murchison
influence
and
he
had
capitulated
early
but
he
had
never
promised
to
answer
for
his
father
yes
he
s
taken
his
time
about
it
and
he
s
consulted
about
all
the
known
authorities
said
his
son
humorously
went
right
back
to
the
manchester
school
to
begin
with
sat
out
on
the
verandah
reading
cobden
and
bright
the
whole
summer
if
anybody
came
for
advice
sent
em
in
to
me
i
did
a
trade
i
tell
you
he
thought
they
talked
an
awful
lot
of
sense
those
fellows
from
the
english
point
of
view
d
ye
mean
to
tell
me
he
d
say
that
a
generation
born
and
bred
in
political
doctrine
of
that
sort
is
going
to
hold
on
to
the
colonies
at
a
sacrifice
they
d
rather
let
em
go
at
a
sacrifice
well
then
he
got
to
reading
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
old
ormiston
lent
him
parkin
and
he
lent
old
ormiston
goldwin
smith
and
then
he
subscribed
to
the
times
for
six
months
the
bill
must
have
nearly
bust
him
and
then
the
squire
went
over
without
waiting
for
him
and
without
any
assistance
from
the
times
either
and
finally
well
he
says
that
if
it
s
good
enough
business
for
the
people
of
england
it
s
good
enough
business
for
him
only
he
keeps
on
worrying
about
the
people
of
england
and
whether
they
ll
make
enough
by
it
to
keep
them
contented
till
he
can
t
next
month
all
right
he
wants
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
family
connection
has
nothing
to
do
with
of
course
it
hasn
t
advena
said
but
we
re
just
as
much
obliged
remarked
stella
a
lot
of
our
church
people
are
going
to
stay
at
home
election
day
declared
abby
they
won
t
vote
for
lorne
and
they
won
t
vote
against
imperialism
so
they
ll
just
sulk
silly
i
call
good
enough
business
for
us
said
alec
well
what
i
want
to
know
is
said
mrs
murchison
whether
you
are
coming
to
the
church
you
were
born
and
brought
up
in
abby
or
not
tonight
there
s
the
first
i
m
not
going
to
any
said
abby
i
went
this
morning
i
m
going
home
to
my
your
father
and
mother
said
mrs
murchison
can
go
twice
a
day
and
be
none
the
worse
for
it
by
the
way
father
did
you
know
old
mrs
parr
was
dead
died
this
morning
at
four
o
clock
they
telephoned
for
dr
drummond
and
i
think
they
had
little
to
do
for
he
had
been
up
with
her
half
the
night
already
mrs
forsyth
told
did
he
go
asked
mr
murchison
he
did
not
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
mrs
forsyth
answered
the
telephone
and
told
them
he
hadn
t
been
two
hours
in
his
bed
and
she
wouldn
t
get
him
out
again
for
an
unconscious
deathbed
and
him
with
bronchitis
on
him
and
two
sermons
to
preach
i
ll
warrant
mrs
forsyth
caught
it
in
the
morning
said
john
murchison
that
she
did
the
doctor
was
as
cross
as
two
sticks
that
she
hadn
t
had
him
out
to
answer
the
phone
i
just
spoke
up
she
said
and
told
him
i
didn
t
see
how
he
was
going
to
do
any
good
to
the
pour
soul
over
a
telephone
it
isn
t
that
he
said
but
i
might
have
put
them
on
to
peter
fratch
for
the
funeral
we
ve
never
had
an
undertaker
in
the
church
before
he
said
he
s
just
come
and
he
ought
to
be
supported
now
i
expect
it
s
too
late
they
ll
have
gone
to
he
rang
them
up
right
away
but
they
dr
drummond
can
t
stand
liscombe
said
alec
as
they
all
laughed
a
little
at
the
doctor
s
foible
all
except
advena
who
laughed
a
great
deal
she
laughed
wildly
then
weakly
i
wouldn
t
think
it
a
pleasure
to
be
buried
by
liscombe
myself
she
cried
hysterically
and
then
laughed
again
until
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
moaned
still
laughing
mr
and
mrs
murchison
alec
stella
and
advena
made
up
the
family
party
oliver
for
reasons
of
his
own
would
attend
the
river
avenue
methodist
church
that
evening
they
slipped
out
presently
into
a
crisp
white
winter
night
the
snow
was
banked
on
both
sides
of
the
street
spreading
garden
fir
trees
huddled
together
weighted
down
with
it
ragged
icicles
hung
from
the
eaves
or
lay
in
long
broken
fingers
on
the
trodden
paths
the
snow
snapped
and
tore
under
their
feet
there
was
a
glorious
moon
that
observed
every
tattered
weed
sticking
up
through
the
whiteness
and
etched
it
with
its
shadow
the
town
lay
under
the
moon
almost
dramatic
almost
mysterious
so
withdrawn
it
was
out
of
the
cold
so
turned
in
upon
its
own
soul
of
the
fireplace
it
might
have
stood
in
the
snow
and
the
silence
for
a
shell
and
a
symbol
of
the
humanity
within
for
angels
or
other
strangers
to
mark
with
curiosity
mr
and
mrs
murchison
were
neither
angels
nor
strangers
they
looked
at
it
and
saw
that
the
peterson
place
was
still
standing
empty
and
that
old
mr
fisher
hadn
t
finished
his
new
porch
before
zero
weather
came
to
stop
him
the
young
people
were
well
ahead
mrs
murchison
on
her
husband
s
arm
stepped
along
with
the
spring
of
an
impetus
undisclosed
is
it
to
be
the
doctor
tonight
asked
john
murchison
he
was
so
hoarse
this
morning
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
to
see
finlay
in
the
pulpit
they
re
getting
only
morning
services
in
east
elgin
just
now
while
they
re
changing
the
lighting
are
they
indeed
well
i
hope
they
ll
change
them
and
be
done
with
it
for
i
can
t
say
i
m
anxious
for
too
much
of
their
mr
finlay
in
knox
oh
you
like
the
man
well
enough
for
a
change
mother
john
assured
her
i
ve
nothing
to
say
against
his
preaching
it
s
the
fellow
himself
and
i
hope
we
won
t
get
him
tonight
for
the
way
i
feel
now
if
i
see
him
gawking
up
the
pulpit
steps
it
ll
be
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
in
my
seat
and
so
i
just
tell
you
you
re
a
little
out
of
patience
with
him
i
see
said
mr
murchison
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
more
than
me
were
out
of
patience
with
him
there
s
such
a
thing
as
too
much
patience
i
ve
i
dare
say
replied
her
husband
cheerfully
if
advena
were
any
daughter
of
mine
she
d
have
less
patience
with
she
s
not
much
like
you
assented
the
father
i
must
say
i
like
a
girl
to
have
a
little
spirit
if
a
man
has
none
and
before
i
d
have
him
coming
to
the
house
week
after
week
the
way
he
has
i
d
see
him
far
he
might
as
well
come
there
as
anywhere
mr
murchison
replied
ambiguously
i
suppose
he
has
now
and
then
time
on
his
hands
well
he
won
t
have
it
on
his
hands
much
he
won
t
eh
no
he
won
t
mrs
murchison
almost
shook
the
arm
she
was
attached
to
john
i
think
you
might
show
a
little
interest
the
man
s
going
to
be
you
don
t
say
that
john
murchison
s
tone
expressed
not
only
astonishment
but
concern
mrs
murchison
was
almost
mollified
but
i
do
say
it
his
future
wife
is
coming
here
to
elgin
next
month
she
and
her
aunt
or
her
grandmother
or
somebody
and
they
re
to
stay
at
dr
drummond
s
and
be
married
as
soon
as
nonsense
said
mr
murchison
which
was
his
way
of
expressing
simple
astonishment
there
s
no
nonsense
about
it
advena
told
me
herself
this
did
she
seem
put
out
about
it
she
s
not
a
girl
to
show
it
mrs
murchison
hedged
if
she
was
i
just
looked
at
her
well
i
said
that
s
a
piece
of
news
when
did
you
hear
it
i
said
oh
i
ve
known
it
all
the
winter
says
my
lady
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
for
an
engaged
man
he
had
been
pretty
liberal
with
his
visits
but
she
had
such
a
queer
look
in
her
eyes
i
couldn
t
express
myself
it
was
just
as
well
left
unsaid
her
husband
told
her
thoughtfully
i
m
not
so
sure
mrs
murchison
retorted
you
re
a
great
man
john
for
letting
everything
alone
when
he
s
been
coming
here
regularly
for
more
than
a
year
putting
ideas
into
the
girl
s
head
he
seems
to
have
told
her
how
things
that
s
all
very
well
if
he
had
kept
himself
to
himself
at
the
same
well
mother
you
know
you
never
thought
much
of
the
no
i
didn
t
mrs
murchison
said
it
wouldn
t
be
me
that
would
be
married
to
him
and
i
ve
always
said
so
but
i
d
got
more
or
less
used
to
it
she
confessed
the
man
s
well
enough
in
some
ways
dear
knows
there
would
be
a
pair
of
them
one
s
as
much
of
a
muddler
as
the
other
and
anybody
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
advena
likes
him
it
hasn
t
turned
out
as
i
expected
that
s
a
fact
john
and
i
m
just
very
much
i
m
not
best
pleased
about
it
myself
said
john
murchison
expressing
as
usual
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
regret
that
he
felt
but
i
suppose
they
know
their
own
thus
in
their
different
ways
did
these
elder
ones
also
acknowledge
their
helplessness
before
the
advancing
event
they
could
talk
of
it
in
private
and
express
their
dissatisfaction
with
it
and
that
was
all
they
could
do
it
would
not
be
a
matter
much
further
turned
over
between
them
at
best
they
would
be
shy
of
any
affair
of
sentiment
in
terms
of
speech
and
from
one
that
affected
a
member
of
the
family
would
help
to
pull
them
the
other
way
mrs
murchison
might
remember
it
in
the
list
of
things
which
roused
her
vain
indignation
john
murchison
would
put
it
away
in
the
limbo
of
irremediables
that
were
better
forgotten
for
the
present
they
had
reached
the
church
door
mrs
murchison
saw
with
relief
that
dr
drummond
occupied
his
own
pulpit
but
if
her
glance
had
gone
the
length
of
three
pews
behind
her
she
would
have
discovered
that
hugh
finlay
made
one
of
the
congregation
fortunately
perhaps
for
her
enjoyment
of
the
service
she
did
not
look
round
dr
drummond
was
more
observing
but
his
was
a
position
of
advantage
in
the
accustomed
sea
of
faces
two
heavy
shadowed
and
obstinately
facing
fate
swam
together
before
dr
drummond
and
after
he
had
lifted
his
hands
and
closed
his
eyes
for
the
long
prayer
he
saw
them
still
so
that
these
words
occurred
near
the
end
in
the
long
prayer
o
thou
searcher
of
hearts
who
hast
known
man
from
the
beginning
to
whom
his
highest
desires
and
his
loftiest
intentions
are
but
as
the
desires
and
intentions
of
a
little
child
look
with
thine
own
compassion
we
beseech
thee
upon
souls
before
thee
in
any
peculiar
difficulty
our
mortal
life
is
full
of
sin
it
is
also
full
of
the
misconception
of
virtue
do
thou
clear
the
understanding
o
lord
of
such
as
would
interpret
thy
will
to
their
own
undoing
do
thou
teach
them
that
as
happiness
may
reside
in
chastening
so
chastening
may
reside
in
happiness
and
though
such
stand
fast
to
their
hurt
do
thou
grant
to
them
in
thine
own
way
which
may
not
be
our
way
a
safe
issue
out
of
the
dangers
that
beset
dr
drummond
had
his
own
method
of
reconciling
foreordination
and
free
will
to
advena
his
supplication
came
with
that
mysterious
double
emphasis
of
chance
words
that
fit
her
thought
played
upon
them
all
through
the
sermon
rejecting
and
rejecting
again
their
application
and
their
argument
and
the
spring
of
hope
in
them
she
too
knew
that
finlay
was
in
church
and
half
timidly
she
looked
back
for
him
as
the
congregation
filed
out
again
into
the
winter
streets
but
he
furious
and
more
resolved
than
ever
had
gone
home
by
another
way
chapter
xxvii
octavius
milburn
was
not
far
beyond
the
facts
when
he
said
that
the
elgin
chamber
of
commerce
was
practically
solid
this
time
against
the
liberal
platform
though
to
what
extent
this
state
of
things
was
due
to
his
personal
influence
might
be
a
matter
of
opinion
mr
milburn
was
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
his
name
stood
for
one
of
the
most
thriving
of
elgin
s
industries
but
he
was
not
a
person
of
influence
except
as
it
might
be
represented
in
a
draft
on
the
bank
of
british
north
america
he
had
never
converted
anybody
to
anything
and
never
would
possibly
because
the
governing
principle
of
his
life
was
the
terror
of
being
converted
to
anything
himself
if
an
important
nonentity
is
an
imaginable
thing
perhaps
it
would
stand
for
mr
milburn
and
he
found
it
a
more
valuable
combination
than
it
may
appear
since
his
importance
gave
him
position
and
opportunity
and
his
nonentity
saved
him
from
their
risks
certainly
he
had
not
imposed
his
view
upon
his
they
would
have
blown
it
off
like
a
feather
yet
they
found
themselves
much
of
his
mind
most
of
them
were
manufacturing
men
of
the
conservative
party
whose
factories
had
been
nursed
by
high
duties
upon
the
goods
of
outsiders
and
few
even
of
the
liberals
among
them
felt
inclined
to
abandon
this
immediate
safeguard
for
a
benefit
more
or
less
remote
and
more
or
less
disputable
john
murchison
thought
otherwise
and
put
it
in
few
words
as
usual
he
said
he
was
more
concerned
to
see
big
prices
in
british
markets
for
canadian
crops
than
he
was
to
put
big
prices
on
ironware
he
couldn
t
sell
he
was
more
afraid
of
hard
times
among
the
farmers
of
canada
than
he
was
of
competition
by
the
manufacturers
of
england
that
is
what
he
said
when
he
was
asked
if
it
didn
t
go
against
the
grain
a
little
to
have
to
support
a
son
who
advocated
low
duties
on
british
ranges
and
when
he
was
not
asked
he
said
nothing
disliking
the
discount
that
was
naturally
put
upon
his
opinion
parsons
of
the
blanket
mills
bolted
at
the
first
hint
of
the
new
policy
and
justified
it
by
reminding
people
that
he
always
said
he
would
if
it
ever
looked
like
business
we
give
their
woollen
goods
a
pull
of
a
third
as
it
is
he
said
which
is
just
a
third
more
than
i
approve
of
i
don
t
propose
to
vote
to
make
it
any
bigger
can
t
afford
he
had
some
followers
but
there
were
also
some
like
young
of
the
plough
works
and
windle
who
made
bicycles
who
announced
that
there
was
no
need
to
change
their
politics
to
defeat
a
measure
that
had
no
existence
and
never
would
have
what
sickened
them
they
declared
was
to
see
young
murchison
allowed
to
give
it
so
much
prominence
as
liberal
doctrine
the
party
had
been
strong
enough
to
hold
south
fox
for
the
best
part
of
the
last
twenty
years
on
the
old
principles
and
this
british
feature
wasn
t
going
to
do
it
any
good
it
was
fool
politics
in
the
opinion
of
mr
young
and
mr
windle
then
remained
the
retail
trades
the
professions
and
the
farmers
both
sides
could
leave
out
of
their
counsels
the
interests
of
the
leisured
class
since
the
leisured
class
in
elgin
consisted
almost
entirely
of
persons
who
were
too
old
to
work
and
therefore
not
influential
the
landed
proprietors
were
the
farmers
when
they
weren
t
alas
the
banks
as
to
the
retail
men
the
prosperity
of
the
stores
of
main
street
and
market
street
was
bound
up
about
equally
with
that
of
fox
county
and
the
elgin
factories
the
lawyers
and
doctors
the
odd
surveyors
and
engineers
were
inclined
by
their
greater
detachment
to
theories
and
prejudices
delightful
luxuries
where
a
certain
rigidity
of
opinion
is
dictated
by
considerations
of
bread
and
butter
they
made
a
factor
debatable
but
small
the
farmers
had
everything
to
win
nothing
to
lose
the
prospect
offered
them
more
for
what
they
had
to
sell
and
less
for
what
they
had
to
buy
and
most
of
them
were
liberals
already
but
the
rest
had
to
be
convinced
and
a
political
change
of
heart
in
a
bosom
of
south
fox
was
as
difficult
as
any
other
industrial
commercial
professional
agricultural
lorne
murchison
scanned
them
all
hopefully
but
walter
winter
felt
them
his
garnered
sheaves
it
will
be
imagined
how
mr
winter
as
a
practical
politician
rejoiced
in
the
aspect
of
things
the
fundamental
change
with
its
incalculable
chances
to
play
upon
the
opening
of
the
gate
to
admit
plain
detriment
in
the
first
instance
for
the
sake
of
benefit
easily
beclouded
in
the
second
the
effective
arm
in
the
hands
of
a
satirist
of
sentiment
in
politics
and
if
there
was
a
weapon
mr
winter
owned
a
weakness
for
it
was
satire
the
whole
situation
as
he
often
confessed
suited
him
down
to
the
ground
he
professed
himself
though
no
optimist
under
any
circumstances
very
well
pleased
only
in
one
other
place
he
declared
would
he
have
preferred
to
conduct
a
campaign
at
the
present
moment
on
the
issue
involved
though
he
would
have
to
change
his
politics
to
do
it
there
and
that
place
was
england
he
cast
an
envious
eye
across
the
ocean
at
the
trenchant
argument
of
the
dear
loaf
he
had
no
such
straight
road
to
the
public
stomach
and
grand
arbitrator
of
the
fate
of
empires
if
the
liberals
in
england
failed
to
turn
out
the
government
over
this
business
they
would
lose
in
his
eyes
all
the
respect
he
ever
had
for
them
which
wasn
t
much
he
acknowledged
when
his
opponents
twitted
him
with
discrepancy
here
since
a
bargain
so
bad
for
one
side
could
hardly
fail
to
favour
the
other
he
poured
all
his
contempt
on
the
scheme
as
concocted
by
damned
enthusiasts
for
the
ruin
of
businessmen
of
both
countries
such
persons
mr
winter
said
if
they
could
have
their
way
would
be
happy
and
satisfied
but
in
his
opinion
neither
england
nor
the
colonies
could
afford
to
please
them
as
much
as
that
he
professed
loud
contempt
for
the
opinions
of
the
conservative
party
organs
at
toronto
and
stood
boldly
for
his
own
views
that
was
what
would
happen
he
declared
in
every
manufacturing
division
in
the
country
if
the
issue
came
to
be
fought
in
a
general
election
he
was
against
the
scheme
root
and
branch
mr
winter
was
skilled
practised
and
indefatigable
we
need
not
follow
him
in
all
his
ways
and
works
a
good
many
of
his
arguments
i
fear
must
also
escape
us
the
elgin
mercury
if
consulted
would
produce
them
in
daily
disclosure
so
would
the
clayfield
standard
one
of
these
offered
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
to
mayor
winter
the
veteran
of
so
many
good
fights
in
being
asked
to
contest
south
fox
with
an
opponent
who
had
not
so
much
as
a
village
reeveship
to
his
public
credit
if
the
conservative
candidate
felt
the
damage
to
his
dignity
however
he
concealed
it
in
elgin
and
clayfield
where
factory
chimneys
had
also
begun
to
point
the
way
to
enterprise
winter
had
a
clear
field
official
reports
gave
him
figures
to
prove
the
great
and
increasing
prosperity
of
the
country
astonishing
figures
of
capital
coming
in
of
emigrants
landing
of
new
lands
broken
new
mineral
regions
exploited
new
railways
projected
of
stocks
and
shares
normal
safe
assured
he
could
ask
the
manufacturers
of
elgin
to
look
no
further
than
themselves
which
they
were
quite
willing
to
do
for
illustration
of
the
plenty
and
the
promise
which
reigned
in
the
land
from
one
end
to
the
other
he
could
tell
them
that
in
their
own
province
more
than
one
hundred
new
industries
had
been
established
in
the
last
year
he
could
ask
them
and
he
did
ask
them
whether
this
was
a
state
of
things
to
disturb
with
an
inrush
from
british
looms
and
rolling
mills
and
they
told
him
with
applause
that
it
was
not
country
audiences
were
not
open
to
arguments
like
these
they
were
slow
in
the
country
as
the
mercury
complained
to
understand
that
agricultural
prospects
were
bound
up
with
the
prosperity
of
the
towns
and
cities
they
had
been
especially
slow
in
the
country
in
england
as
the
express
ironically
pointed
out
to
understand
it
so
winter
and
his
supporters
asked
the
farmers
of
south
fox
if
they
were
prepared
to
believe
all
they
heard
of
the
good
will
of
england
to
the
colonies
with
the
flattering
assumption
that
they
were
by
no
means
prepared
to
believe
it
was
it
a
likely
thing
mr
winter
inquired
that
the
people
of
great
britain
were
going
to
pay
more
for
their
flour
and
their
bacon
their
butter
and
their
cheese
than
they
had
any
need
to
do
simply
out
of
a
desire
to
benefit
countries
which
most
of
them
had
never
seen
and
never
would
see
no
said
mr
winter
they
might
take
it
from
him
that
was
not
the
idea
but
mr
winter
thought
there
was
an
idea
and
that
they
and
he
together
would
not
have
much
trouble
in
deciphering
it
he
did
not
claim
to
be
in
politics
than
any
other
man
but
he
thought
the
present
british
idea
was
pretty
plain
it
was
in
two
words
to
secure
the
canadian
market
for
british
goods
and
a
handsome
contribution
from
the
canadian
taxpayer
toward
the
expense
of
the
british
army
and
navy
in
return
for
the
offer
of
favours
to
food
supplies
from
canada
but
this
as
they
all
knew
was
not
the
first
time
favours
had
been
offered
by
the
british
government
to
food
supplies
from
canada
just
sixty
years
ago
the
british
government
had
felt
one
of
these
spasms
of
benevolence
to
canada
and
there
were
men
sitting
before
him
who
could
remember
the
good
will
and
the
gratitude
the
hope
and
the
confidence
that
greeted
stanley
s
bill
of
that
year
which
admitted
canadian
wheat
and
flour
at
a
nominal
duty
some
could
remember
and
those
who
could
not
remember
could
read
how
the
farmers
and
the
millers
of
ontario
took
heart
and
laid
out
capital
and
how
money
was
easy
and
enterprise
was
everywhere
and
how
agricultural
towns
such
as
elgin
was
at
that
time
sent
up
streets
of
shops
to
accommodate
the
trade
that
was
to
pour
in
under
the
new
and
generous
preference
granted
to
the
dominion
by
the
mother
country
and
how
long
mr
winter
demanded
swinging
round
in
that
pivotal
manner
which
seems
assisted
by
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
the
waistcoat
how
long
did
the
golden
illusion
last
precisely
three
years
in
precisely
three
years
the
british
nation
compelled
the
british
government
to
adopt
the
free
trade
act
of
the
wheat
of
the
world
flowed
into
every
port
in
england
and
the
hopes
of
canada
especially
the
hopes
of
ontario
based
then
as
now
on
preferential
treatment
were
blasted
to
the
root
enterprise
was
laid
flat
mortgages
were
foreclosed
shops
were
left
empty
the
milling
and
forwarding
interests
were
temporarily
ruined
and
the
actually
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
england
that
things
were
so
bad
that
not
a
shilling
could
be
raised
on
the
credit
of
the
province
now
mr
winter
did
not
blame
the
people
of
england
for
insisting
on
free
food
it
was
the
policy
that
suited
their
interests
and
they
had
just
as
good
a
right
to
look
after
their
interests
he
conceded
handsomely
as
anybody
else
but
he
did
blame
the
british
government
for
holding
out
hopes
for
making
definite
pledges
to
a
young
and
struggling
nation
which
they
must
have
known
they
would
not
be
able
to
redeem
he
blamed
their
action
then
and
he
would
blame
it
now
if
the
opportunity
were
given
to
them
to
repeat
it
for
the
opportunity
would
pass
and
the
pledge
would
pass
into
the
happy
hunting
ground
of
unrealizable
politics
but
not
and
mr
winter
asked
his
listeners
to
mark
this
very
carefully
not
until
canada
was
committed
to
such
relations
of
trade
and
taxes
with
the
imperial
government
as
would
require
the
most
heroic
efforts
it
might
run
to
a
war
to
extricate
herself
from
in
plain
words
mr
winter
assured
his
country
audiences
great
britain
had
sold
them
before
and
she
would
sell
them
again
he
stood
there
before
them
as
loyal
to
british
connection
as
any
man
he
addressed
a
public
as
loyal
to
british
connection
as
any
public
but
once
bitten
twice
shy
horace
williams
might
riddle
such
arguments
from
end
to
end
in
the
next
day
s
express
but
if
there
is
a
thing
that
we
enjoy
in
the
country
it
is
having
the
dodges
of
government
shown
up
with
ignominy
and
mr
winter
found
his
account
in
this
historic
parallel
nothing
could
have
been
more
serious
in
public
than
his
line
of
defence
against
the
danger
that
menaced
but
in
friendly
ears
mr
winter
derided
it
as
a
practical
possibility
like
the
liberals
young
and
windle
it
seems
to
me
he
said
talking
to
octavius
milburn
that
the
important
thing
at
present
is
the
party
attitude
to
the
disposition
of
crown
lands
and
to
railways
as
for
this
racket
of
wallingham
s
it
has
about
as
much
in
it
as
an
empty
he
s
running
round
taking
a
lot
of
satisfaction
blowing
it
out
just
now
and
the
swells
over
there
are
clapping
like
anything
but
the
first
knock
will
show
that
it
s
just
a
with
a
hole
in
folks
in
the
old
country
are
solid
on
the
buns
though
said
milburn
as
they
parted
and
alfred
hesketh
who
was
walking
with
his
host
said
it
s
bound
in
the
end
to
get
down
to
that
isn
t
it
presently
hesketh
came
back
to
it
quaint
idea
that
describing
wallingham
s
policy
as
a
he
said
and
laughed
winter
is
an
amusing
wallingham
s
policy
won
t
even
be
a
much
longer
said
milburn
it
won
t
be
anything
at
all
imperial
union
is
very
nice
to
talk
about
but
when
you
come
down
to
hard
fact
it
s
australia
for
the
australians
canada
for
the
canadians
africa
for
the
africans
every
each
for
himself
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
said
hesketh
and
when
the
hindmost
is
england
as
our
friend
murchison
declares
it
will
be
so
much
the
worse
for
england
said
milburn
amiably
but
we
should
all
be
sorry
to
see
it
and
for
my
part
i
don
t
believe
such
a
thing
is
at
all
likely
and
you
may
be
certain
of
one
thing
he
continued
impressively
no
flag
but
the
union
jack
will
ever
wave
over
oh
i
m
sure
of
that
hesketh
responded
since
i
have
heard
more
of
your
side
of
the
question
i
am
quite
convinced
that
loyalty
to
england
and
complete
commercial
independence
i
might
say
even
commercial
antagonism
may
exist
together
in
the
colonies
it
seems
paradoxical
but
it
is
mr
hesketh
had
naturally
been
hearing
a
good
deal
more
of
mr
milburn
s
side
of
the
question
staying
as
he
was
under
mr
milburn
s
hospitable
roof
it
had
taken
the
least
persuasion
in
the
world
to
induce
him
to
make
the
milburns
a
visit
he
found
them
delightful
people
he
described
them
in
his
letters
home
as
the
most
typically
canadian
family
he
had
met
quite
simple
and
unconventional
but
thoroughly
and
touchingly
devoted
to
england
politically
he
could
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
mr
milburn
but
he
could
quite
perceive
mr
milburn
s
grounds
for
the
view
he
held
one
thing
he
explained
to
his
correspondents
you
learned
at
once
by
visiting
the
colonies
and
that
was
to
make
allowance
for
local
conditions
both
social
and
economic
he
and
mr
milburn
had
long
serious
discussions
staying
behind
in
the
to
have
them
after
tea
when
the
ladies
took
their
fancy
work
into
the
and
dora
s
light
touch
was
heard
upon
the
piano
it
may
be
supposed
that
hesketh
brought
every
argument
forward
in
favour
of
the
great
departure
that
had
been
conceived
in
england
he
certainly
succeeded
in
interesting
his
host
very
deeply
in
the
english
point
of
view
he
had
however
to
encounter
one
that
was
made
in
canada
it
resided
in
mr
milburn
as
a
stone
might
reside
in
a
bag
of
wool
mr
milburn
wouldn
t
say
that
this
preference
trade
idea
if
practicable
might
not
work
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
empire
as
a
whole
that
was
a
thing
he
didn
t
pretend
to
know
but
it
wouldn
t
work
out
for
his
benefit
that
was
a
thing
he
did
know
when
a
man
was
confronted
with
a
big
political
change
the
question
he
naturally
asked
himself
was
is
it
going
to
be
worth
my
while
and
he
acted
on
the
answer
to
that
question
he
was
able
to
explain
to
hesketh
by
a
variety
of
facts
and
figures
of
fascinating
interest
to
the
inquiring
mind
just
how
and
where
such
a
concern
as
the
milburn
boiler
company
would
be
hit
by
the
new
policy
after
which
he
asked
his
guest
fairly
now
if
you
were
in
my
shoes
would
you
see
your
way
to
voting
for
any
such
thing
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
said
hesketh
thoughtfully
i
can
t
say
i
on
grounds
of
sentiment
octavius
assured
him
they
were
absolutely
at
one
but
in
practical
matters
a
man
had
to
proceed
on
business
principles
he
went
about
at
this
time
expressing
great
esteem
for
hesketh
s
capacity
to
assimilate
facts
his
opportunity
to
assimilate
them
was
not
curtailed
by
any
further
demand
for
his
services
in
the
south
fox
campaign
he
was
as
willing
as
ever
he
told
lorne
murchison
to
enlist
under
the
flag
and
not
for
the
first
time
but
murchison
and
farquharson
and
that
lot
while
grateful
for
the
offer
seemed
never
quite
able
to
avail
themselves
of
it
the
fact
was
all
the
dates
were
pretty
well
taken
up
no
doubt
hesketh
acknowledged
the
work
could
be
done
best
by
men
familiar
with
the
local
conditions
but
he
could
not
avoid
the
conviction
that
this
attitude
toward
proffered
help
was
very
like
dangerous
trifling
possibly
these
circumstances
gave
him
an
added
impartiality
for
mr
milburn
s
facts
as
the
winter
advanced
his
enthusiasm
for
the
country
increased
with
his
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
possibilities
of
the
elgin
boiler
the
elgin
boiler
was
his
in
the
development
of
the
colonies
he
paid
several
visits
to
the
works
to
study
it
and
several
times
he
thanked
mr
milburn
for
the
opportunity
of
familiarizing
himself
with
such
an
important
and
promising
branch
of
canadian
industry
it
looks
said
octavius
one
evening
in
early
february
as
if
the
grits
were
getting
a
little
anxious
about
south
fox
high
time
too
i
see
cruickshank
is
down
to
speak
at
clayfield
on
the
seventh
and
tellier
is
to
be
here
for
the
big
meeting
at
the
opera
house
on
the
tellier
is
minister
of
public
works
isn
t
he
asked
hesketh
yes
and
cruickshank
is
an
replied
mr
milburn
looks
pretty
shaky
when
they
ve
got
to
take
men
like
that
away
from
their
work
in
the
middle
of
the
i
shall
be
glad
remarked
his
daughter
dora
when
this
horrid
election
is
over
it
spoils
she
spoke
a
little
fretfully
the
election
and
the
matters
it
involved
did
interfere
a
good
deal
with
her
interest
in
life
as
an
occupation
it
absorbed
lorne
murchison
even
more
completely
than
she
occasionally
desired
and
as
a
topic
it
took
up
a
larger
share
of
the
attention
of
mr
alfred
hesketh
than
she
thought
either
reasonable
or
pleasing
between
politics
and
boilers
miss
milburn
almost
felt
at
times
that
the
world
held
a
second
place
for
her
chapter
xxviii
the
progress
of
mrs
kilbannon
and
miss
christie
cameron
up
the
river
to
montreal
and
so
west
to
elgin
was
one
series
of
surprises
most
of
them
pleasant
and
instructive
to
such
a
pair
of
intelligent
scotchwomen
if
we
leave
out
the
number
of
roman
catholic
churches
that
lift
their
special
symbol
along
the
banks
of
the
st
lawrence
and
the
fact
that
hugh
finlay
was
not
in
elgin
to
meet
them
upon
their
arrival
dr
drummond
of
course
was
there
at
the
station
to
explain
finlay
had
been
obliged
to
leave
for
winnipeg
only
the
day
before
to
attend
a
mission
conference
in
place
of
a
delegate
who
had
been
suddenly
laid
aside
by
serious
illness
finlay
he
said
had
been
very
loath
to
go
but
there
were
many
reasons
why
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
dr
drummond
explained
them
all
i
insisted
on
it
he
assured
them
frankly
i
told
him
i
would
take
the
he
seemed
very
capable
of
taking
it
both
the
ladies
must
have
thought
with
his
quick
orders
about
the
luggage
and
his
waiting
cab
mrs
kilbannon
said
so
i
m
sure
she
told
him
we
are
better
off
with
you
than
with
hugh
he
was
always
a
daft
dependence
at
a
railway
they
both
mrs
kilbannon
and
dr
drummond
looked
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
so
to
speak
at
christie
the
only
one
who
might
be
expected
to
show
any
sensitiveness
but
miss
cameron
accepted
the
explanation
with
readiness
indeed
she
said
she
would
have
been
real
vexed
if
mr
finlay
had
stayed
behind
on
her
account
she
showed
herself
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
a
nomination
and
the
desirability
of
responding
to
it
it
will
just
give
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
town
she
said
looking
at
it
through
the
cab
windows
as
they
drove
and
dr
drummond
had
to
admit
that
she
seemed
a
sensible
creature
other
things
being
equal
finlay
might
be
doing
very
well
for
himself
as
they
talked
of
scotland
it
transpired
that
dr
drummond
knew
all
the
braes
about
bross
as
a
boy
he
found
himself
more
than
ever
annoyed
with
finlay
about
the
inequality
of
other
things
and
when
they
passed
knox
church
and
miss
cameron
told
him
she
hadn
t
realized
it
was
so
imposing
an
edifice
he
felt
downright
sorry
for
the
woman
dr
drummond
had
persuaded
finlay
to
go
to
winnipeg
with
a
vague
hope
that
something
in
the
fortnight
s
grace
thus
provided
might
be
induced
to
happen
the
form
it
oftenest
took
to
his
imagination
was
miss
christie
s
announcement
when
she
set
foot
upon
the
station
platform
that
she
had
become
engaged
on
the
way
over
to
somebody
else
some
such
things
dr
drummond
knew
did
come
about
usually
bringing
distress
and
discomfiture
in
their
train
why
then
should
they
not
happen
when
all
the
consequences
would
be
rejoiceful
it
was
plain
enough
however
that
nothing
of
the
kind
had
come
to
pass
miss
christie
had
arrived
in
elgin
bringing
her
affections
intact
they
might
have
been
in
any
one
of
her
portmanteaux
she
had
come
with
definite
calm
intention
precisely
in
the
guise
in
which
she
should
have
been
expected
at
the
very
hour
in
the
very
clothes
she
was
there
robust
and
pleasant
with
a
practical
eye
on
her
promising
future
she
had
arrived
the
fulfilment
of
despair
dr
drummond
looked
at
her
with
acquiescence
wondering
at
his
own
folly
in
dreaming
of
anything
else
miss
cameron
brought
the
situation
as
it
were
with
her
it
had
to
be
faced
and
dr
drummond
faced
it
like
a
philosopher
she
was
the
material
necessity
the
fact
in
the
case
the
substantiation
of
her
own
legend
and
dr
drummond
promptly
gave
her
all
the
consideration
she
demanded
in
this
aspect
already
he
heard
himself
pronouncing
a
blessing
over
the
pair
and
they
would
make
the
best
of
it
with
characteristic
dispatch
he
decided
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
the
first
monday
after
finlay
s
return
that
would
give
them
time
to
take
a
day
or
two
in
toronto
perhaps
and
get
back
for
finlay
s
wednesday
prayer
meeting
or
i
could
take
it
off
his
hands
said
dr
drummond
to
himself
that
would
free
them
till
the
end
of
the
solicitude
increased
in
him
that
the
best
should
be
made
of
it
after
all
for
a
long
time
they
had
been
making
the
worst
mrs
forsyth
whom
it
had
been
necessary
to
inform
when
mrs
kilbannon
and
miss
cameron
became
actually
imminent
saw
plainly
that
the
future
mrs
finlay
had
made
a
very
good
impression
on
the
doctor
and
as
nature
in
mrs
forsyth
s
case
was
more
powerful
than
grace
she
became
critical
accordingly
still
she
was
an
honest
soul
she
found
more
fault
with
what
she
called
miss
cameron
s
than
with
miss
cameron
herself
whom
she
didn
t
doubt
to
be
a
good
woman
though
she
would
never
see
again
time
and
observation
would
no
doubt
mend
or
remodel
the
and
meanwhile
both
they
and
miss
cameron
would
do
very
well
for
east
elgin
mrs
forsyth
avowed
mrs
kilbannon
definitely
given
over
to
caps
and
curls
as
they
still
wear
them
in
bross
mrs
forsyth
at
once
formed
a
great
opinion
of
she
might
be
something
mrs
forsyth
thought
out
of
a
novel
by
mr
crockett
and
made
you
long
to
go
to
scotland
where
presumably
everyone
was
like
her
on
the
whole
the
ladies
from
bross
profited
rather
than
lost
by
the
new
frame
they
stepped
into
in
the
house
of
dr
drummond
of
elgin
ontario
their
special
virtues
of
dignity
and
solidity
and
frugality
stood
out
saliently
against
the
ease
and
unconstraint
about
them
in
the
profusion
of
the
table
it
was
little
less
than
edifying
to
hear
mrs
kilbannon
invited
to
preserves
say
thank
you
i
have
it
was
the
pleasantest
spectacle
happily
common
enough
of
the
world
s
greatest
inheritance
we
see
it
in
immigrants
of
all
degrees
and
we
may
perceive
it
in
miss
cameron
and
mrs
kilbannon
they
come
in
couples
and
in
companies
from
those
little
imperial
islands
bringing
the
crusted
qualities
of
the
old
blood
bottled
there
so
long
and
sink
with
grateful
absorption
into
the
wide
bountiful
stretches
of
the
further
countries
they
have
much
to
take
but
they
give
themselves
and
so
it
comes
about
that
the
empire
is
summed
up
in
the
race
and
the
flag
flies
for
its
ideals
mrs
forsyth
had
been
told
of
the
approaching
event
but
neither
dr
drummond
who
was
not
fond
of
making
communications
he
did
not
approve
of
nor
the
murchisons
who
were
shy
of
the
matter
as
a
queer
business
which
advena
seemed
too
much
mixed
up
with
had
mentioned
it
to
anyone
else
finlay
himself
had
no
intimates
and
moved
into
his
new
house
in
river
street
under
little
comment
his
doings
excited
small
surprise
because
the
town
knew
too
little
about
him
to
expect
him
to
do
one
thing
more
than
another
he
was
very
significant
among
his
people
very
important
in
their
lives
but
not
somehow
at
any
expense
to
his
private
self
he
knew
them
but
they
did
not
know
him
and
it
is
high
praise
of
him
that
this
was
no
grievance
among
them
they
would
tell
you
without
resentment
that
the
minister
was
a
very
reserved
man
there
might
be
even
a
touch
of
proper
pride
in
it
the
worshippers
of
knox
church
mission
were
rather
a
reserved
lot
themselves
it
was
different
with
the
methodists
plenty
of
expansion
there
elgin
therefore
knew
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
dr
drummond
had
two
ladies
from
the
old
country
staying
with
him
about
whom
particular
curiosity
would
hardly
be
expected
outside
of
knox
church
in
view
of
finlay
s
absence
dr
drummond
consulting
with
mrs
kilbannon
decided
that
for
the
present
elgin
need
not
be
further
informed
there
was
no
need
they
agreed
to
give
people
occasion
to
talk
and
it
would
just
be
a
nuisance
to
have
to
make
so
many
explanations
both
mrs
kilbannon
and
her
niece
belonged
to
the
race
that
takes
great
satisfaction
in
keeping
its
own
counsel
their
situation
gained
for
them
the
further
interest
that
nothing
need
be
said
about
it
and
the
added
importance
of
caution
was
plainly
to
be
discerned
in
their
bearing
even
toward
one
another
it
was
a
portentous
business
this
of
marrying
a
minister
under
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
not
to
be
lightly
dealt
with
and
even
more
of
an
undertaking
in
a
far
new
country
where
the
very
wind
blew
differently
and
the
extraordinary
freedom
of
conversation
made
it
more
than
ever
necessary
to
take
heed
to
what
you
were
saying
so
far
as
miss
cameron
and
mrs
kilbannon
were
aware
the
matter
had
not
been
spoken
of
elsewhere
at
all
dr
drummond
remembering
advena
murchison
s
acquaintance
with
it
had
felt
the
weight
of
a
complication
and
had
discreetly
held
his
tongue
mrs
kilbannon
approved
her
nephew
in
this
connection
hugh
she
said
was
never
one
to
let
on
more
than
it
was
a
fine
secret
between
hugh
in
winnipeg
whence
he
had
written
all
that
was
lawful
or
desirable
and
themselves
at
dr
drummond
s
miss
cameron
said
it
would
give
her
more
freedom
to
look
about
her
in
the
midst
of
all
this
security
and
on
the
very
first
day
after
their
arrival
it
was
disconcerting
to
be
told
that
a
lady
whose
name
they
had
never
heard
before
had
called
to
see
miss
cameron
and
mrs
kilbannon
they
had
not
even
appeared
at
church
as
they
told
one
another
with
dubious
glances
they
had
no
reason
whatever
to
expect
visitors
dr
drummond
was
in
the
cemetery
burying
a
member
mrs
forsyth
was
also
abroad
now
who
in
the
world
asked
mrs
kilbannon
of
miss
cameron
is
miss
murchison
they
come
to
our
church
said
sarah
in
the
door
they
ve
got
the
foundry
it
s
the
oldest
one
she
sarah
in
the
door
was
even
more
disconcerting
than
an
unexpected
visitor
sarah
invariably
took
them
off
their
guard
in
the
door
or
anywhere
she
freely
invited
their
criticism
but
they
would
not
have
known
how
to
mend
her
they
looked
at
her
now
helplessly
and
mrs
kilbannon
said
very
well
we
will
be
down
it
may
be
just
some
friendly
body
she
said
as
they
descended
the
stairs
together
or
it
may
be
common
curiosity
in
that
case
we
ll
disappoint
whatever
they
expected
therefore
it
was
not
advena
it
was
not
a
tall
young
woman
with
expressive
eyes
a
manner
which
was
at
once
abrupt
and
easy
and
rather
a
lounging
way
of
occupying
the
corner
of
a
sofa
when
she
sat
down
as
mrs
kilbannon
said
afterward
she
seemed
to
untie
and
fling
herself
as
you
might
a
neither
mrs
kilbannon
nor
christie
cameron
could
possibly
be
untied
or
flung
so
perhaps
they
gave
this
capacity
in
advena
more
importance
than
it
had
but
it
was
only
a
part
of
what
was
to
them
a
new
human
demonstration
something
to
inspect
very
carefully
and
accept
very
cautiously
the
product
like
themselves
yet
so
suspiciously
different
of
these
free
airs
and
these
astonishingly
large
ideas
in
some
ways
as
she
sat
there
in
her
graceful
dress
and
careless
attitude
asking
them
direct
smiling
questions
about
their
voyage
she
imposed
herself
as
of
the
class
whom
both
these
ladies
of
bross
would
acknowledge
unquestioningly
to
be
above
them
in
others
she
seemed
to
be
of
no
class
at
all
so
far
she
came
short
of
small
standards
of
speech
and
behaviour
the
ladies
from
bross
more
and
more
confused
grew
more
and
more
reticent
when
suddenly
out
of
a
simple
remark
of
miss
cameron
s
about
missing
in
the
train
the
cans
they
gave
you
to
your
feet
in
scotland
reticence
descended
upon
miss
murchison
also
she
sat
in
an
odd
silence
looking
at
miss
cameron
absorbed
apparently
in
the
need
of
looking
at
her
finding
nothing
to
say
her
flow
of
pleasant
inquiry
dried
up
and
all
her
soul
at
work
instead
to
perceive
the
woman
mrs
kilbannon
was
beginning
to
think
better
of
her
it
was
so
much
more
natural
to
be
a
little
backward
with
strangers
when
the
moment
passed
their
visitor
drew
herself
out
of
it
with
almost
a
perceptible
effort
and
seemed
to
glance
consideringly
at
them
in
their
aloofness
their
incommunicativeness
their
plain
odds
with
her
i
don
t
know
what
she
expected
but
we
may
assume
that
she
was
there
simply
to
offer
herself
up
and
the
impulse
of
sacrifice
seldom
considers
whether
or
not
it
may
be
understood
it
was
to
her
a
normal
natural
thing
that
a
friend
of
hugh
finlay
s
should
bring
an
early
welcome
to
his
bride
and
to
do
the
normal
natural
thing
at
keen
personal
cost
was
to
sound
that
depth
or
rise
to
that
height
of
the
spirit
where
pain
sustains
we
know
of
advena
that
she
was
prone
to
this
form
of
exaltation
those
who
feel
themselves
capable
may
pronounce
whether
she
would
have
been
better
at
home
crying
in
her
bedroom
she
decided
badly
how
could
she
decide
well
on
what
she
would
say
to
explain
herself
i
am
so
sorry
she
told
them
that
mr
finlay
is
obliged
to
be
it
was
quite
wrong
it
assumed
too
much
her
knowledge
and
their
confidence
and
the
propriety
of
discussing
mr
finlay
s
absence
there
was
even
an
unconscious
hint
of
another
kind
of
assumption
in
it
a
suggestion
of
apology
for
mr
finlay
advena
was
aware
of
it
even
as
it
left
her
lips
and
the
perception
covered
her
with
a
damning
blush
she
had
a
sudden
terrified
misgiving
that
her
role
was
too
high
for
her
that
she
had
already
cracked
her
mask
but
she
looked
quietly
at
miss
cameron
and
smiled
across
the
tide
that
surged
in
her
as
she
added
he
was
very
distressed
at
having
to
they
looked
at
her
in
an
instant
s
blank
astonishment
miss
cameron
opened
her
lips
and
closed
them
again
glancing
at
mrs
kilbannon
they
fell
back
together
but
not
in
disorder
this
was
something
much
more
formidable
than
common
curiosity
just
what
it
was
they
would
consider
later
meanwhile
mrs
kilbannon
responded
with
what
she
would
have
called
cool
civility
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
mr
finlay
is
my
nephew
she
said
indeed
i
have
mr
finlay
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
you
mrs
kilbannon
and
about
his
life
at
bross
advena
replied
and
he
has
told
me
about
you
too
she
went
on
turning
to
christie
cameron
indeed
said
she
oh
a
long
time
ago
he
has
been
looking
forward
to
your
arrival
for
some
months
hasn
t
he
we
took
our
passages
in
december
said
miss
cameron
and
you
are
to
be
married
almost
immediately
are
you
not
miss
murchison
continued
pleasantly
mrs
kilbannon
had
an
inspiration
could
he
by
any
means
have
had
the
banns
cried
she
demanded
of
christie
who
looked
piercingly
at
their
visitor
for
the
answer
oh
no
advena
laughed
softly
presbyterians
haven
t
that
custom
over
here
does
it
still
exist
anywhere
mr
finlay
told
me
has
he
informed
all
his
acquaintances
asked
mrs
kilbannon
we
thought
maybe
his
elders
would
be
expecting
to
hear
or
his
board
of
management
or
he
might
have
just
dropped
a
word
to
his
sessions
clerk
but
advena
shook
her
head
i
think
it
unlikely
she
said
then
why
would
he
be
telling
you
inquired
the
elder
lady
bluntly
he
told
me
i
suppose
because
i
have
the
honour
to
be
a
friend
of
his
advena
said
smiling
but
he
is
not
a
man
is
he
who
makes
many
friends
it
is
possible
i
dare
say
that
he
has
mentioned
it
to
no
one
poor
advena
she
had
indeed
uttered
her
ideal
to
unsympathetic
ears
brought
her
pig
as
her
father
would
have
said
to
the
wrong
market
she
sat
before
the
ladies
from
bross
hugh
finlay
s
only
confidante
she
sat
handsome
and
upheld
and
not
altogether
penetrable
a
kind
of
gipsy
to
their
understanding
though
indeed
the
romany
strain
in
her
was
beyond
any
divining
of
theirs
they
on
their
part
reposed
in
their
clothes
with
all
their
bristles
out
what
else
could
have
been
expected
of
them
convinced
in
their
own
minds
that
they
had
come
not
only
to
a
growing
but
to
a
forward
country
mrs
kilbannon
was
perhaps
a
little
severe
i
wonder
that
we
have
not
heard
of
you
miss
murchison
said
she
but
we
are
happy
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
of
my
nephew
s
friends
you
will
have
heard
him
preach
perhaps
often
said
advena
rising
we
have
no
one
here
who
can
compare
with
him
in
preaching
there
was
very
little
reason
why
you
should
have
heard
of
me
i
am
of
no
she
hesitated
and
fought
for
an
instant
with
a
trembling
of
the
lip
but
now
that
you
have
been
persuaded
to
be
a
part
of
our
life
here
she
said
to
christie
i
thought
i
would
like
to
come
and
offer
you
my
friendship
because
it
is
his
already
i
hope
so
much
that
you
will
be
happy
here
it
is
a
nice
little
place
and
i
want
you
to
let
me
help
you
about
your
house
and
in
every
way
that
is
possible
i
am
sure
i
can
be
of
she
paused
and
looked
at
their
still
faces
i
hope
she
faltered
you
don
t
mind
my
having
come
not
at
all
said
christie
and
mrs
kilbannon
added
i
m
sure
you
mean
it
very
a
flash
of
the
comedy
of
it
shot
up
in
advena
s
eyes
yes
she
said
i
do
if
they
had
followed
her
departure
they
would
have
been
further
confounded
to
see
her
walk
not
quite
steadily
away
shaken
with
fantastic
laughter
they
looked
instead
at
one
another
as
if
to
find
the
solution
of
the
mystery
where
indeed
it
lay
in
themselves
she
doesn
t
even
belong
to
his
congregation
said
christie
just
a
friend
she
i
expect
the
friendship
s
mostly
upon
her
side
remarked
mrs
kilbannon
she
seemed
frank
enough
about
it
but
i
would
see
no
necessity
for
encouraging
her
friendship
on
my
own
account
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
think
i
ll
manage
without
it

chapter

the
south
fox
fight
was
almost
over
three
days
only
remained
before
the
polling
booths
would
be
open
and
the
voters
of
the
towns
of
elgin
and
clayfield
and
the
surrounding
townships
would
once
again
be
invited
to
make
their
choice
between
a
liberal
and
a
conservative

by
either
side

was
no

of
the
hope
that
sat
behind
the
deprecation
in

eye
nor
of
the
anxiety
that
showed
through
the
confidence
freely
expressed
by
the
liberal
leaders
the
issue
would
be
no
foregone
conclusion
as
it
had
been
practically
any
time
within
the
last
eleven
years

as
horace

remarked
to

that
met
pretty
frequently
at
the
express
office
for
consultation
and
rally
they
had
no
use
for
any
sort
of
it
was
undeniably
felt
that
the
new
idea
the
great
idea
whose
putative
fatherhood
in
canada
certainly
lay
at
the
door
of
the
liberal
party
had
drawn
in
fewer
supporters

might

except
that
wallingham
was
so
hard
to
effectively
curse
the
deserved
clearly
any
ban
that
could
be
put
upon
him
no
sort
of
remonstrance
could
hold
him
from
going
about
openly
and
persistently
exhorting
people
to
think
imperially
a
liberty
which
as
is
well
known
the
holy
cobdenite
church
supreme
in
those
islands
expressly
forbids
wallingham
appeared
to
think
that
by
teaching
and
explaining
he
could
help
his
to
see
further
than
the
length
of
their
fists
and
exorcise
from
them
the
spirit
only
a
century
and
a
quarter
older
and
a
trifle
more
sophisticated
that
lost
them
the
american
colonies
but
so
far
little
had
transpired
to
show
that
wallingham
was
stronger
than
nature
and
destiny
there
had
been
wallingham
meetings
of
remarkable
enthusiasm
his
supporters
called
them
as
if
epochs
were
made
of
cheers
but
the
workingman
of
great
britain
was
declaring
stolidly
in
the
against
any
favour
to
colonial
produce
at
his
expense
thereby
showing
himself
one
of
those
humble
instruments
that
providence
uses
for
the
downfall
of
arrogant
empires
it
will
be
thus
no
doubt
that
the
workingman
will
explain
in
the
future
his
eminent
usefulness
to
the
government
of
his
country
and
it
will
be
in
these
terms
that
the
cost
of
educating
him
by
means
of
the
ballot
will
be
demonstrated
meanwhile
we
may
look
on
and
cultivate
philosophy
or
we
may
make
war
upon
the
gods
with
mr
wallingham
which
is
perhaps
the
better
part
that
to
turn
from
recrimination
was
what
they
saw
in
canada
looking
across
the
queerest
thing
of
all
was
the
recalcitrance
of
the
farm
labourer
they
could
only
stare
at
that
and
it
may
be
that
the
spectacle
was
depressing
to
hopeful
initiative
at
all
events
it
was
plain
that
the
new
policy
was
suffering
from
a
certain
flatness
on
the
further
side
as
a
ballon
d
essai
it
lacked
buoyancy
and
no
doubt
mr
farquharson
was
right
in
declaring
that
above
all
things
it
lacked
actuality
business
the
proposition
in
good
set
terms
for
men
to
turn
over
to
accept
or
reject
nothing
could
be
done
with
it
mr
farquharson
averred
as
a
mere
prospect
it
was
useful
only
to
its
enemies
we
of
the
young
countries
must
be
invited
to
deeds
not
theories
of
which
we
have
a
restless
impatience
and
this
particular
theory
though
of
golden
promise
was
beginning
to
recoil
to
some
extent
upon
the
cause
which
had
been
confident
enough
to
adopt
it
before
it
could
be
translated
into
action
and
its
hard
equivalent
the
elgin
mercury
probably
overstated
the
matter
when
it
said
that
the
grits
were
dead
sick
of
the
preference
they
would
never
get
but
horace
williams
was
quite
within
the
mark
when
he
advised
lorne
to
stick
to
old
reform
principles
clean
administration
generous
railway
policy
sympathetic
labour
legislation
and
freeze
himself
a
little
on
imperial
love
and
attachment
they
re
not
so
sweet
on
it
in
ottawa
as
they
were
by
a
long
chalk
he
said
look
at
the
premier
s
speech
to
the
chambers
of
commerce
in
montreal
pretty
plain
statement
that
of
a
few
things
the
british
government
needn
t
oh
i
don
t
know
said
lorne
he
was
talking
to
manufacturers
you
know
a
pretty
skittish
lot
anywhere
it
sounded
independent
but
if
you
look
into
it
you
won
t
find
it
gave
the
cause
away
the
old
man
s
got
to
think
of
quebec
where
his
fat
little
majority
lives
remarked
bingham
chairman
of
the
most
difficult
subdivision
in
the
town
the
premier
of
this
country
drives
a
team
you
yes
said
lorne
but
he
drives
it
tandem
and
johnny
francois
is
the
second
maybe
so
returned
mr
williams
but
the
organ
s
singing
pretty
small
too
look
at
he
picked
up
the
dominion
from
the
office
table
and
read
aloud
if
great
britain
wishes
to
do
a
deal
with
the
colonies
she
will
find
them
willing
to
meet
her
in
a
spirit
of
fairness
and
enthusiasm
but
it
is
for
her
to
decide
and
canada
would
be
the
last
to
force
her
bread
down
the
throat
of
the
british
labourer
at
a
higher
price
than
he
can
afford
to
pay
for
what
s
that
my
boy
is
it
no
sir
it
s
the
dominion
makes
me
sick
said
young
murchison
it
s
so
scared
of
the
tory
source
of
the
scheme
in
england
that
it
s
handing
the
whole
boom
of
the
biggest
chance
this
country
ever
had
over
to
the
tories
here
if
anything
will
help
us
to
lose
it
that
will
no
conservative
government
in
canada
can
put
through
a
cent
of
preference
on
english
goods
when
it
comes
to
the
touch
and
they
know
it
they
re
full
of
loyalty
just
now
baying
the
moon
but
if
anybody
opens
a
window
they
ll
turn
tail
fast
i
guess
the
dominion
knows
it
too
said
mr
williams
when
great
britain
is
quite
sure
she
s
ready
to
do
business
on
preference
lines
it
s
the
liberal
party
on
this
side
she
ll
have
to
talk
to
no
use
showing
ourselves
too
anxious
you
know
besides
it
might
do
harm
over
there
we
re
all
right
we
re
on
record
wallingham
knows
as
well
as
we
do
the
lines
we
re
open
on
he
s
heard
them
from
canadian
liberals
more
than
once
when
they
get
good
and
ready
they
can
let
us
jolly
them
up
with
it
at
your
meetings
by
all
means
advised
bingham
but
use
it
as
a
kind
of
superfluous
taffy
don
t
make
it
your
main
the
reform
association
of
south
fox
had
no
more
energetic
officer
than
bingham
though
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
editorial
table
chewing
portions
of
the
margin
of
that
afternoon
s
express
and
drawling
out
maxims
to
the
liberal
candidate
you
might
not
have
thought
so
he
was
explaining
that
he
had
been
in
this
business
for
years
and
had
never
had
a
job
that
gave
him
so
much
trouble
we
ll
win
out
he
said
but
the
canvass
isn
t
any
christmas
joy
not
this
time
there
s
jim
whelan
he
told
them
we
all
know
what
jim
is
a
tory
from
way
back
where
they
make
em
so
they
last
and
a
soaker
from
way
back
too
one
day
on
his
job
and
two
days
sleepin
off
his
whiskey
now
we
don
t
need
jim
whelan
s
vote
never
did
need
it
but
the
boys
have
generally
been
able
to
see
that
one
of
those
two
days
was
election
day
there
s
no
necessity
for
jim
s
putting
in
his
paper
a
character
like
that
no
necessity
at
all
he
d
much
better
be
comfortable
in
bed
this
time
i
m
darned
if
the
old
boozer
hasn
t
sworn
off
tells
the
boys
he
s
on
to
their
game
and
there
s
no
liquor
in
this
town
that
s
good
enough
to
get
him
to
lose
his
vote
wouldn
t
get
drunk
on
champagne
he
s
held
out
for
ten
days
already
and
it
looks
like
winter
d
take
his
cross
all
right
on
i
guess
i
d
let
him
have
it
bingham
said
lorne
murchison
with
a
kind
of
tolerant
deprecation
void
of
offence
the
only
manner
in
which
he
knew
how
to
convey
disapproval
to
the
older
man
the
boys
in
your
division
are
a
pretty
tough
lot
anyhow
we
don
t
want
the
other
side
getting
hold
of
any
monkey
it
s
necessary
to
win
this
election
young
man
said
bingham
lawfully
you
won
t
have
any
trouble
with
my
it
was
not
as
will
be
imagined
the
first
discussion
so
late
in
the
day
of
the
value
of
the
preference
trade
argument
to
the
liberal
campaign
they
had
all
realized
after
the
first
few
weeks
that
their
young
candidate
was
a
trifle
overbitten
with
it
though
remonstrance
had
been
a
good
deal
curbed
by
murchison
s
treatment
of
it
when
he
had
brought
it
forward
at
the
late
fall
fairs
and
in
the
lonely
country
schoolhouses
his
talk
had
been
so
trenchant
so
vivid
and
pictorial
that
the
gathered
farmers
listened
with
open
mouths
like
children
pathetically
used
with
life
to
a
fairy
tale
as
horace
williams
said
if
a
dead
horse
could
be
made
to
go
this
one
would
have
brought
murchison
romping
in
and
lorne
had
taken
heed
to
the
counsel
of
his
party
leaders
at
joint
meetings
which
offered
the
enemy
his
best
opportunity
for
travesty
and
derision
he
had
left
it
in
the
background
of
debate
devoting
himself
to
arguments
of
more
immediate
utility
in
the
literature
of
the
campaign
it
glowed
with
prospective
benefit
but
vaguely
like
a
halo
of
liberal
conception
and
possible
achievement
waiting
for
the
word
from
overseas
the
express
still
approved
it
but
not
in
headlines
and
wished
the
fact
to
be
widely
understood
that
while
the
imperial
idea
was
a
very
big
idea
the
liberals
of
south
fox
were
going
to
win
this
election
without
any
assistance
from
it
lorne
submitted
after
all
victory
was
the
thing
there
could
be
no
conquest
for
the
idea
without
the
party
triumph
first
he
submitted
but
his
heart
rebelled
he
looked
over
the
subdivisional
reports
with
williams
and
farquharson
and
gave
ear
to
their
warning
interpretations
but
his
heart
was
an
optimist
and
turned
always
to
the
splendid
projection
upon
the
future
that
was
so
incomparably
the
title
to
success
of
those
who
would
unite
to
further
it
his
mind
accepted
the
old
working
formulas
for
dealing
with
an
average
electorate
but
to
his
eager
apprehending
heart
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
the
great
imperial
possibility
the
dramatic
chance
for
the
race
that
hung
even
now
in
the
history
of
the
world
between
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
should
fail
to
be
perceived
and
acknowledged
as
the
paramount
issue
the
contingency
which
made
the
of
south
fox
an
extraordinary
and
momentous
affair
he
believed
in
the
idea
he
saw
it
with
wallingham
not
only
a
glorious
prospect
but
an
educative
force
and
never
had
he
a
moment
of
such
despondency
that
it
confounded
him
upon
his
horizon
in
the
faded
colours
of
some
old
elizabethan
mirage
the
opera
house
the
night
of
mr
murchison
s
final
address
to
the
electors
of
south
fox
was
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
a
large
and
patient
overflow
made
the
best
of
the
hearing
accommodation
of
the
corridors
and
the
foyer
a
minister
was
to
speak
sir
matthew
tellier
who
held
the
portfolio
of
public
works
and
for
drawing
a
crowd
in
elgin
there
was
nothing
to
compare
with
a
member
of
the
government
he
was
the
sum
of
all
ambition
and
the
centre
of
all
importance
he
was
held
to
have
achieved
in
the
loftiest
sense
and
probably
because
he
deserved
to
a
kind
of
afflatus
sat
upon
him
they
paid
him
real
deference
and
they
flocked
to
hear
him
cruickshank
was
a
second
attraction
and
lorne
himself
even
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
drew
without
abatement
they
knew
young
murchison
well
enough
he
had
gone
in
and
out
among
them
all
his
life
yet
since
he
had
come
before
them
in
this
new
capacity
a
curious
interest
had
gathered
about
him
people
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
developed
something
they
did
not
understand
and
perhaps
he
had
he
was
in
touch
with
the
idea
they
listened
with
an
intense
personal
interest
in
him
which
no
doubt
went
to
obscure
what
he
said
perhaps
a
less
absorbing
personality
would
have
carried
the
idea
further
however
they
did
look
and
listen
that
was
the
main
point
and
on
their
last
opportunity
they
were
in
the
opera
house
in
great
numbers
lorne
faced
them
with
an
enviable
security
the
friendliness
of
the
meeting
was
in
the
air
the
gathering
was
almost
entirely
of
one
political
complexion
the
conservatives
of
the
town
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
turn
out
to
hear
minister
tellier
but
the
liberals
were
of
no
mind
to
gratify
them
at
the
cost
of
having
to
stand
themselves
and
were
on
hand
early
to
assert
a
prior
moral
claim
to
chairs
in
the
seated
throng
lorne
could
pick
out
the
fine
head
of
his
father
and
his
mother
s
face
bright
with
anticipation
beside
advena
was
there
too
and
stella
and
the
boys
would
have
a
perch
not
too
conspicuous
somewhere
in
the
gallery
dr
drummond
was
in
the
second
row
and
a
couple
of
strange
ladies
with
him
he
was
chuckling
with
uncommon
humour
at
some
remark
of
the
younger
one
when
lorne
noted
him
old
sandy
macquhot
was
in
a
good
place
had
been
since
six
o
clock
and
peter
macfarlane
too
for
that
matter
though
peter
sat
away
back
as
beseemed
a
modest
functionary
whose
business
was
with
the
book
and
the
bell
altogether
as
horace
williams
leaned
over
to
tell
him
it
was
like
a
knox
church
sociable
he
could
feel
completely
at
home
and
though
the
audience
was
by
no
means
confined
to
knox
church
lorne
did
feel
at
home
dora
milburn
s
countenance
he
might
perhaps
have
missed
but
dora
was
absent
by
arrangement
mr
milburn
as
the
fight
went
on
had
shown
himself
so
increasingly
bitter
to
the
point
of
writing
letters
in
the
mercury
attacking
wallingham
and
the
liberal
leaders
of
south
fox
that
his
daughter
felt
an
insurmountable
delicacy
in
attending
even
lorne
s
big
alfred
hesketh
meant
to
have
gone
but
it
was
ten
by
the
milburns
clock
before
he
remembered
miss
filkin
actually
did
go
and
brought
home
a
great
report
of
it
miss
filkin
would
no
more
have
missed
a
minister
than
she
would
a
bishop
but
she
was
the
only
one
lorne
had
prepared
for
this
occasion
for
a
long
time
it
was
certain
to
come
the
day
of
the
supreme
effort
when
he
should
make
his
final
appeal
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
that
could
be
devised
when
the
harassing
work
of
the
campaign
would
be
behind
him
and
nothing
would
remain
but
the
luxury
of
one
last
strenuous
call
to
arms
the
glory
of
that
anticipation
had
been
with
him
from
the
beginning
and
in
the
beginning
he
saw
his
great
moment
only
in
one
character
for
weeks
while
he
plodded
through
the
details
of
the
benefits
south
fox
had
received
and
might
expect
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
liberal
party
he
privately
stored
argument
on
argument
piled
phrase
on
phrase
still
further
to
advance
and
defend
the
imperial
unity
of
his
vision
on
this
certain
and
special
opportunity
his
jihad
it
would
be
for
the
faith
and
purpose
of
his
race
so
he
scanned
it
and
heard
it
with
conviction
hot
in
him
and
impulse
strong
and
intention
noble
then
uneasiness
had
arisen
as
we
know
and
under
steady
pressure
he
had
daily
drawn
himself
from
these
high
intentions
persuaded
by
bingham
and
the
rest
that
they
were
not
yet
in
shape
to
talk
about
so
that
his
address
on
this
memorable
evening
would
have
a
different
stamp
from
the
one
he
designed
in
the
early
burning
hours
of
his
candidature
he
had
postponed
those
matters
under
advice
to
the
hour
of
practical
dealing
when
a
government
which
it
would
be
his
privilege
to
support
would
consider
and
carry
them
he
put
the
notes
of
his
original
speech
away
in
his
office
desk
with
solicitude
it
was
indeed
very
thorough
a
grand
marshalling
of
the
facts
and
review
of
the
principles
involved
and
pigeonholed
it
in
the
chambers
of
his
mind
with
the
good
hope
to
bring
it
forth
another
day
then
he
devoted
his
attention
to
the
history
of
liberalism
in
fox
county
both
ridings
were
solid
and
it
was
upon
the
history
of
liberalism
in
fox
county
its
triumphs
and
its
fruits
that
he
embarked
so
easily
and
so
assuredly
when
he
opened
his
address
in
the
opera
house
that
tuesday
night
who
knows
at
what
suggestion
or
even
precisely
at
what
moment
the
fabric
of
his
sincere
intention
fell
away
bingham
does
not
mr
farquharson
has
the
vaguest
idea
dr
drummond
declares
that
he
expected
it
from
the
beginning
but
is
totally
unable
to
say
why
i
can
get
nothing
more
out
of
them
though
they
were
all
there
though
they
all
saw
him
indeed
a
dramatic
figure
standing
for
the
youth
and
energy
of
the
old
blood
and
heard
him
as
he
slipped
away
into
his
great
preoccupation
as
he
made
what
bingham
called
his
bad
his
very
confidence
may
have
accounted
for
it
he
was
off
guard
against
the
enemy
and
the
more
completely
off
guard
against
himself
the
history
of
liberalism
in
fox
county
offered
no
doubt
some
inlet
to
the
rush
of
the
idea
for
suddenly
mr
farquharson
says
he
was
mr
farquharson
was
on
the
platform
and
i
can
tell
you
said
he
i
pricked
up
my
they
all
did
the
idea
came
in
upon
such
a
personal
note
i
claim
it
my
great
good
fortune
the
young
man
was
suddenly
telling
them
in
a
note
of
curious
gravity
and
concentration
and
however
the
fight
goes
i
shall
always
claim
it
my
great
good
fortune
to
have
been
identified
at
a
critical
moment
with
the
political
principles
that
are
ennobled
in
this
country
by
the
imperialistic
aim
an
intention
a
great
purpose
in
the
endless
construction
and
reconstruction
of
the
world
will
choose
its
own
agency
and
the
imperial
design
in
canada
has
chosen
the
liberal
party
because
the
liberal
party
in
this
country
is
the
party
of
the
soil
the
land
the
nation
as
it
springs
from
that
which
makes
it
a
nation
and
imperialism
is
intensely
and
supremely
a
national
affair
ours
is
the
policy
of
the
fields
we
stand
for
the
and
the
stockyard
the
forest
and
the
mine
as
the
basic
interests
of
the
country
we
stand
for
the
principles
that
make
for
by
the
slow
sweet
processes
of
the
earth
cultivating
the
individual
rooted
man
who
draws
his
essence
and
his
tissues
from
the
soil
and
so
by
unhurried
natural
healthy
growth
labour
sweating
his
vices
out
of
him
forms
the
character
of
the
commonwealth
the
foundation
of
the
state
so
the
imperial
idea
seeks
its
canadian
home
in
liberal
councils
the
imperial
idea
is
england
has
outlived
her
own
body
apart
from
her
heart
and
her
history
england
is
an
area
where
certain
trades
are
carried
on
still
carried
on
in
the
scrolls
of
the
future
it
is
already
written
that
the
centre
of
the
empire
must
shift
and
where
if
not
to
canada
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
dr
drummond
s
the
first
clap
it
was
a
curious
change
from
the
simple
colloquial
manner
in
which
young
murchison
had
begun
and
to
which
the
audience
were
accustomed
and
on
this
account
probably
they
stamped
the
harder
they
applauded
lorne
himself
something
from
him
infected
them
they
applauded
being
made
to
feel
like
that
they
would
clap
first
and
consider
afterward
john
murchison
smiled
with
pleasure
but
shook
his
head
bingham
doubled
up
and
clapping
like
a
repeating
rifle
groaned
aloud
under
cover
of
it
to
horace
williams
oh
the
darned
kid
a
certain
liberal
peer
of
blessed
political
memory
lorne
continued
with
a
humorous
twist
of
his
mouth
on
one
of
those
graceful
elegant
academic
occasions
which
offer
political
peers
such
happy
opportunities
of
getting
in
their
work
over
there
had
lately
a
vision
which
he
described
to
his
university
audience
of
what
might
have
happened
if
the
american
colonies
had
remained
faithful
to
great
britain
a
vision
of
monarch
and
ministers
government
and
parliament
departing
solemnly
for
the
other
hemisphere
they
did
not
so
remain
so
the
noble
peer
may
conjure
up
his
vision
or
dismiss
his
nightmare
as
he
chooses
and
it
is
safe
to
prophesy
that
no
port
of
the
united
states
will
see
that
entry
but
remembering
that
the
greater
half
of
the
continent
did
remain
faithful
the
northern
and
strenuous
half
destined
to
move
with
sure
steps
and
steady
mind
to
greater
growth
and
higher
place
among
the
nations
than
any
of
us
can
now
imagine
would
it
be
as
safe
to
prophesy
that
such
a
momentous
will
never
be
more
than
the
fantasy
of
aristocratic
rhetoric
is
it
not
at
least
as
easy
to
imagine
that
even
now
while
the
people
of
england
send
their
viceroys
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
vote
careless
millions
for
a
reconstructed
army
and
sit
in
the
wrecks
of
cabinets
disputing
whether
they
will
eat
our
bread
or
the
stranger
s
the
sails
may
be
filling
in
the
far
harbour
of
time
which
will
bear
their
descendants
to
a
representative
share
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
empire
in
the
capital
of
the
dominion
of
canada
it
was
the
boldest
proposition
and
the
liberal
voters
of
the
town
of
elgin
blinked
a
little
looking
at
it
still
they
applauded
hurriedly
to
get
it
over
and
hear
what
more
might
be
coming
bingham
on
the
platform
laughed
heartily
and
conspicuously
as
if
anybody
could
see
that
it
was
all
an
excellent
joke
lorne
to
him
with
a
gesture
of
protest
then
he
went
on
if
that
transport
ever
left
the
shores
of
england
we
would
go
far
some
of
us
to
meet
it
but
for
all
the
purposes
that
matter
most
it
sailed
long
ago
british
statesmen
could
bring
us
nothing
better
than
the
ideals
of
british
government
and
those
we
have
had
since
we
levied
our
first
tax
and
made
our
first
law
that
precious
cargo
was
our
heritage
and
we
never
threw
it
overboard
but
chose
rather
to
render
what
impost
it
brought
and
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
impost
has
been
heavy
though
never
a
dollar
was
he
paused
for
an
instant
and
seemed
to
review
and
take
account
of
what
he
had
said
he
was
hopelessly
adrift
from
the
subject
he
had
proposed
to
himself
launched
for
better
or
for
worse
upon
the
theme
that
was
subliminal
in
him
and
had
flowed
up
on
which
he
was
launched
and
almost
rudderless
without
construction
and
without
control
the
speech
of
his
first
intention
orderly
developed
was
as
far
from
him
as
the
history
of
liberalism
in
fox
county
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
and
then
under
the
suggestion
no
doubt
of
that
ancient
misbehaviour
in
boston
harbour
at
which
he
had
hinted
he
took
up
another
argument
i
will
quote
him
a
little
let
us
hold
he
said
simply
to
the
empire
let
us
keep
this
patrimony
that
has
been
ours
for
three
hundred
years
let
us
not
forget
the
flag
we
believe
ourselves
at
this
moment
in
no
danger
of
forgetting
it
the
day
after
paardeburg
that
still
winter
day
did
not
our
hearts
rise
within
us
to
see
it
shaken
out
with
its
message
everywhere
shaken
out
against
the
snow
how
it
spoke
to
us
and
lifted
us
the
silent
flag
in
the
new
fallen
snow
theirs
and
ours
that
was
but
a
little
while
ago
and
there
is
not
a
man
here
who
will
not
bear
me
out
in
saying
that
we
were
never
more
loyal
in
word
and
deed
than
we
are
now
and
that
very
state
of
things
has
created
for
us
an
undermining
alternative
so
long
as
no
force
appeared
to
improve
the
trade
relations
between
england
and
this
country
canada
sought
in
vain
to
make
commercial
bargains
with
the
united
states
they
would
have
none
of
us
or
our
produce
they
kept
their
wall
just
as
high
against
us
as
against
the
rest
of
the
world
not
a
pine
plank
or
a
bushel
of
barley
could
we
get
over
under
a
reciprocal
arrangement
but
the
imperial
trade
idea
has
changed
the
attitude
of
our
friends
to
the
south
they
have
small
liking
for
any
scheme
which
will
improve
trade
between
great
britain
and
canada
because
trade
between
great
britain
and
canada
must
be
improved
at
their
expense
and
now
you
can
not
take
up
an
american
paper
without
finding
the
report
of
some
commercial
association
demanding
closer
trade
relations
with
canada
or
an
american
magazine
in
which
some
economist
is
not
urging
the
same
thing
they
see
us
thinking
about
keeping
the
business
in
the
family
with
that
hard
american
common
sense
that
has
made
them
what
they
are
they
accept
the
situation
and
at
this
moment
they
are
ready
to
offer
us
better
terms
to
keep
our
bingham
horace
williams
and
mr
farquharson
applauded
loudly
their
young
man
frowned
a
little
and
squared
his
chin
he
was
past
hints
of
that
kind
and
that
he
went
on
to
say
is
on
the
surface
a
very
satisfactory
state
of
things
no
doubt
a
bargain
between
the
americans
and
ourselves
could
be
devised
which
would
be
a
very
good
bargain
on
both
sides
in
the
absence
of
certain
pressing
family
affairs
it
might
be
as
well
worth
our
consideration
as
we
used
to
think
it
before
we
were
invited
to
the
family
council
but
if
anyone
imagines
that
any
degree
of
reciprocity
with
the
united
states
could
be
entered
upon
without
killing
the
idea
of
british
preference
trade
for
all
time
let
him
consider
what
canada
s
attitude
toward
that
idea
would
be
today
if
the
americans
had
consented
to
our
proposals
years
ago
and
we
were
invited
to
make
an
imperial
sacrifice
of
the
american
trade
that
had
prospered
as
it
would
have
prospered
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
doubt
whether
the
proposition
would
even
be
made
to
us
but
the
alternative
before
canada
is
not
a
mere
choice
of
markets
we
are
confronted
with
a
much
graver
issue
in
this
matter
of
dealing
with
our
neighbour
our
very
existence
is
involved
if
we
would
preserve
ourselves
as
a
nation
it
has
become
our
business
not
only
to
reject
american
overtures
in
favour
of
the
overtures
of
our
own
great
england
but
to
keenly
watch
and
actively
resist
american
influence
as
it
already
threatens
us
through
the
common
channels
of
life
and
energy
we
often
say
that
we
fear
no
invasion
from
the
south
but
the
armies
of
the
south
have
already
crossed
the
border
american
enterprise
american
capital
is
taking
rapid
possession
of
our
mines
and
our
water
power
our
oil
areas
and
our
timber
limits

today
s
dominion
one
paper
alone
you
may
read
of

granted
to

concerns

states
the

unions
of
the
two
countries

american
settlers
are
pouring
into
the
of
the
northwest
and
when
the
dominion
of
canada
has
paid
the
hundred
million
dollars
she
has
just
voted
for
a
railway
to
open
up
the
great
lone
northern
lands
between
quebec
and
the
pacific
it
will
be
the
american
farmer
and
the
american
capitalist
who
will
reap
the
benefit
they
approach
us
today
with
all
the
arts
of
peace
commercial
missionaries
to
the
ungathered
harvests
of
neglected
territories
but
the
day
may
come
when
they
will
menace
our
coasts
to
protect
their
markets
unless
by
firm
resolved
action
now
we
keep
our
opportunities
for
our
own
they
cheered
him
promptly
and
a
gathered
intensity
came
into
his
face
at
the
note
of
praise
nothing
on
earth
can
hold
him
now
said
bingham
as
he
crossed
his
arms
upon
a
breast
seething
with
practical
politics
and
waited
for
the
worst
the
question
of
the
hour
for
us
said
lorne
murchison
to
his
curbing
the
strenuous
note
in
his
voice
is
deeper
than
any
balance
of
trade
can
indicate
wider
than
any
department
of
statistics
can
prove
we
can
not
calculate
it
in
terms
of
or
reduce
it
to
any
formula
of
consumption
the
question
that
underlies
this
decision
for
canada
is
that
of
the
whole
stamp
and
character
of
her
future
existence
is
that
stamp
and
character
to
be
impressed
by
the
american
republic
effacing
he
smiled
a
little
the
old
queen
s
head
and
the
new
king
s
oath
or
is
it
to
be
our
own
stamp
and
character
acquired
in
the
rugged
discipline
of
our
colonial
youth
and
developed
in
the
national
usage
of
the
british
empire
dr
drummond
clapped
alone
everybody
else
was
listening
it
is
ours
he
told
them
in
this
greater
half
of
the
continent
to
evolve
a
nobler
ideal
the
americans
from
the
beginning
went
in
a
spirit
of
revolt
the
seed
of
disaffection
was
in
every
puritan
bosom
we
from
the
beginning
went
in
a
spirit
of
amity
forgetting
nothing
disavowing
nothing
to
plant
the
flag
with
our
fortunes
we
took
our
very
constitution
our
very
chart
of
national
life
from
england
her
laws
her
liberty
her
equity
were
good
enough
for
us
we
have
lived
by
them
some
of
us
have
died
by
them
and
thank
god
we
were
long
poor
and
this
republic
he
went
on
hotly
this
republic
that
menaces
our
national
life
with
commercial
extinction
what
past
has
she
that
is
comparable
the
daughter
who
left
the
old
stock
to
be
the
light
woman
among
nations
welcoming
all
comers
mingling
her
pure
blood
polluting
her
lofty
ideals
until
it
is
hard
indeed
to
recognize
the
features
and
the
aims
of
her
honourable
youth
allowance
will
be
made
for
the
intemperance
of
his
figure
he
believed
himself
you
see
at
the
bar
for
the
life
of
a
nation
let
us
not
hesitate
to
announce
ourselves
for
the
empire
to
throw
all
we
are
and
all
we
have
into
the
balance
for
that
great
decision
the
seers
of
political
economy
tell
us
that
if
the
stars
continue
to
be
propitious
it
is
certain
that
a
day
will
come
which
will
usher
in
a
union
of
the
nations
of
the
world
as
between
england
and
the
united
states
the
predominant
partner
in
that
firm
will
be
the
one
that
brings
canada
so
that
the
imperial
movement
of
the
hour
may
mean
even
more
than
the
future
of
the
motherland
may
reach
even
farther
than
the
boundaries
of
great
britain
again
he
paused
and
his
eye
ranged
over
their
listening
faces
he
had
them
all
with
him
his
words
were
vivid
in
their
minds
the
truth
of
them
stood
about
him
like
an
atmosphere
even
bingham
looked
at
him
without
reproach
but
he
had
done
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
his
voice
dropping
with
a
hint
of
tiredness
to
another
level
i
have
the
honour
to
stand
for
your
suffrages
as
candidate
in
the
liberal
interest
for
the
riding
of
south
fox
in
the
dominion
house
of
commons
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
solicit
your
support
and
i
hereby
pledge
myself
to
justify
it
by
every
means
in
my
power
but
it
would
be
idle
to
disguise
from
you
that
while
i
attach
all
importance
to
the
immediate
interests
in
charge
of
the
liberal
party
and
if
elected
shall
use
my
best
efforts
to
further
them
the
great
task
before
that
party
in
my
opinion
the
overshadowing
task
to
which
i
shall
hope
in
my
place
and
degree
to
stand
committed
from
the
beginning
is
the
one
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
bring
before
your
consideration
this
they
gave
him
a
great
appreciation
and
mr
cruickshank
following
spoke
in
complimentary
terms
of
the
eloquent
appeal
made
by
the
young
and
vigorous
protagonist
of
the
imperial
cause
but
proceeded
to
a
number
of
quite
other
and
apparently
more
important
grounds
why
he
should
be
elected
the
hon
mr
tellier
s
speech
the
minister
was
always
kept
to
the
last
was
a
defence
of
the
recent
dramatic
development
of
the
government
s
railway
policy
and
a
reminder
of
the
generous
treatment
elgin
was
receiving
in
the
estimates
for
the
following
year
thirty
thousand
dollars
for
a
new
drill
hall
and
fifteen
thousand
for
improvements
to
the
it
was
a
telling
speech
with
the
chink
of
hard
cash
in
every
sentence
a
kind
of
audit
by
a
chartered
accountant
of
the
liberal
books
of
south
fox
showing
good
sound
reason
why
the
liberal
candidate
should
be
returned
on
thursday
if
only
to
keep
the
balance
right
the
audience
listened
with
practical
satisfaction
that

all
over
they
said
to
one
another

effect
in

door
of
the
opera
house
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
worth
to

trade
said
bingham
but
it
wasn
t
worth
a
hill
o
beans
to
his
own
he
had
as
soft
a
snap
returned
horace
williams
on
the
brink
of
tears
as
soft
a
snap
as
anybody
ever
had
in
this
town
and
he
s
monkeyed

all
away
all
both
the
local

the
milburns
doorbell
rang
very
early
the
morning
of
the
election
the
family
and
alfred
hesketh
were
just
sitting
down
to
breakfast
mr
hesketh
was
again
the
guest
of
the
house
he
had
taken
a
run
out
to
vancouver
with
mr
milburn
s
partner
who
had
gone
to
settle
a
point
or
two
in
connection
with
the
establishment
of
a
branch
there
the
points
had
been
settled
and
hesketh
having
learned
more
than
ever
had
returned
to
elgin
the
maid
came
back
into
the
room
with
a
conscious
air
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
dora
who
flushed
and
frowned
a
little
and
asked
to
be
excused
as
she
left
the
room
a
glance
of
intelligence
passed
between
her
and
her
mother
while
miss
milburn
was
generally
thought
to
be
most
like
her
father
both
in
appearance
and
disposition
there
were
points
upon
which
she
could
count
on
an
excellent
understanding
with
her
other
parent
oh
lorne
she
said
having
carefully
closed
the
door
what
in
the
world
have
you
come
here
for
today
of
all
days
did
anybody
see
you
the
young
man
standing
tall
and
before
the
mantelpiece
had
yet
a
look
of
expecting
reproach
i
don
t
know
he
said
humbly
i
don
t
think
father
would
like
it
dora
told
him
if
he
knew
you
were
here
why
we
re
having
an
early
breakfast
on
purpose
to
let
him
get
out
and
work
for
winter
i
never
saw
him
so
excited
over
an
election
to
think
of
your
coming
today
he
made
a
step
toward
her
i
came
because
it
is
today
he
said
only
for
a
minute
dear
it
s
a
great
day
for
me
you
know
whether
we
win
or
lose
i
wanted
you
to
be
in
it
i
wanted
you
to
wish
me
good
but
you
know
i
always
do
she
objected
yes
i
know
but
a
fellow
likes
to
hear
it
dora
on
the
day
you
know
and
i
ve
seen
so
little
of
you
she
looked
at
him
measuringly
you
re
looking
awfully
thin
she
exclaimed
with
sudden
compunction
i
wish
you
had
never
gone
into
this
horrid
campaign
i
wish
they
had
nominated
somebody
lorne
smiled
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
a
few
other
people
wished
the
same
thing
he
said
but
i
m
afraid
they
ll
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
dora
had
not
sanctioned
his
visit
by
sitting
down
and
as
he
came
nearer
to
her
she
drew
a
step
away
moving
by
instinct
from
the
capture
of
the
lover
but
he
had
made
little
of
that
and
almost
as
he
spoke
was
at
her
side
she
had
to
yield
her
hands
to
him
well
you
ll
win
it
for
them
if
anybody
could
she
assured
him
say
win
it
for
us
she
shook
her
head
i
m
not
a
liberal
yet
she
said
laughing
it
s
only
a
question
of
i
ll
never
be
converted
to
grit
no
but
you
ll
be
converted
to
me
he
told
her
and
drew
her
nearer
i
m
going
now
dora
i
dare
say
i
shouldn
t
have
come
every
minute
counts
today
she
could
not
withhold
her
face
from
his
asking
lips
and
he
had
bent
to
take
his
privilege
when
a
step
in
the
hall
threatened
and
divided
them
it
s
only
mr
hesketh
going
upstairs
said
dora
with
relief
i
thought
it
was
father
oh
lorne
fly
hesketh
young
murchison
s
face
clouded
is
he
working
for
winter
too
lorne
what
a
thing
to
ask
when
you
know
he
believes
in
your
ideas
but
he
s
a
conservative
at
home
you
see
so
he
says
he
s
in
an
awkward
position
and
he
has
been
taking
perfectly
neutral
ground
lately
he
hasn
t
a
vote
no
said
lorne
he
s
of
no
the
familiar
easy
step
in
the
house
of
his
beloved
the
house
he
was
being
entreated
to
leave
with
all
speed
struck
upon
his
heart
and
his
nerves
she
with
her
dull
surface
to
the
more
delicate
vibrations
of
things
failed
to
perceive
this
or
perhaps
she
would
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
find
some
word
to
bring
back
his
peace
she
disliked
seeing
people
unhappy
when
she
was
five
years
old
and
her
kitten
broke
its
leg
she
had
given
it
to
a
servant
to
drown
he
took
his
hat
making
no
further
attempt
to
caress
her
and
opened
the
door
i
hope
you
will
win
lorne
she
said
and
he
with
forced
cheerfulness
replied
oh
we
ll
have
a
shot
at
then
with
a
little
silent
nod
at
her
which
notwithstanding
her
provocations
conveyed
his
love
and
trust
he
went
out
into
the
struggle
of
the
day
in
spite
of
squire
ormiston
s
confident
prediction
it
was
known
that
the
fight
would
be
hottest
among
the
townships
in
moneida
reservation
elgin
itself
of
course
would
lead
the
van
for
excitement
would
be
the
real
theatre
for
the
arts
of
practical
politics
but
things
would
be
pretty
warm
in
moneida
too
it
was
for
that
reason
that
bingham
and
the
rest
strongly
advised
lorne
not
to
spend
too
much
of
the
day
in
the
town
but
to
get
out
to
moneida
early
and
drive
around
with
ormiston
stick
to
him
like
a
fly
to
you
leave
elgin
to
your
friends
said
bingham
just
show
your
face
here
and
there
wearing
a
smile
of
triumph
to
encourage
the
crowd
but
don
t
worry
about
the
details
we
ll
attend
to
we
can
t
have
him
upsettin
his
own
election
by
any
interference
with
the
boys
said
bingham
to
horace
williams
he
s
got
too
long
a
nose
for
all
kinds
of
things
to
be
comfortable
in
town
today
he
ll
do
a
great
deal
less
harm
trotting
round
the
reserve
braced
up
against
old
so
elgin
was
left
to
the
capable
hands
of
the
boys
for
the
furtherance
of
the
liberal
interest
and
the
sacred
cause
of
imperialism
mr
farquharson
whose
experience
was
longer
and
whose
nose
presumably
shorter
than
the
candidate
s
never
abandoned
the
town
ward
bingham
skirmished
between
the
and
the
committee
room
horace
williams
was
out
all
day
rawlins
edited
the
paper
the
returns
wouldn
t
be
ready
in
time
for
anything
but
an
extra
anyhow
and
the
stand
to
arms
south
fox
leader
had
been
written
two
days
ago
the
rest
was
millinery
or
might
be
for
all
anybody
would
read
of
it
the
other
side
had
a
better
idea
of
the
value
of
their
candidate
than
to
send
him
into
the
country
walter
winter
remained
where
he
was
most
effective
and
most
at
home
he
had
a
neat
little
livery
outfit
and
he
seemed
to
spend
the
whole
day
in
it
accompanied
by
intimate
personal
friends
who
had
never
spoken
to
him
much
less
driven
with
him
before
two
or
three
strangers
arrived
the
previous
night
at
the
leading
hotels
their
business
was
various
but
they
had
one
point
in
common
they
were
very
solicitous
about
their
personal
luggage
i
should
be
sorry
to
assign
their
politics
and
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
much
about
the
merits
of
the
candidates
so
they
are
not
perhaps
very
pertinent
except
for
the
curiosity
shown
by
the
public
at
the
spectacle
of
gentlemen
carrying
their
own
bags
when
there
were
porters
to
do
it
it
was
a
day
long
remembered
and
long
quoted
the
weather
was
sun
after
a
week
s
thaw
it
was
pleasant
to
be
abroad
in
the
relaxed
air
and
the
drying
streets
that
here
and
there
sent
up
threads
of
steam
after
the
winter
of
their
wooden
sidewalks
voting
was
a
privilege
never
unappreciated
in
elgin
and
today
the
weather
brought
out
every
soul
to
the
polls
the
ladies
of
his
family
waiting
in
many
instances
on
the
verandah
with
shawls
over
their
heads
to
hear
the
report
of
how
the
fight
was
going
abby
saw
dr
harry
back
in
his
consulting
room
and
dr
henry
safely
off
to
vote
and
then
took
the
two
children
and
went
over
to
her
father
s
house
because
she
simply
could
not
endure
the
suspense
anywhere
else
the
adventurous
stella
picketed
herself
at
a
corner
near
the
empty
grocery
which
served
as
a
for
subdivision
eleven
one
of
the
most
doubtful
but
was
forced
to
retire
at
the
sight
of
the
first
carryall
full
of
men
from
the
milburn
boiler
company
flaunting
a
banner
inscribed
we
are
solid
for
met
in
the
hall
by
her
sister
she
protested
that
she
hadn
t
cried
till
she
got
inside
the
gate
anyhow
abby
lectured
her
soundly
on
her
want
of
proper
pride
she
was
much
too
big
a
girl
to
be
seen
around
on
a
day
when
her
brother
was
running
if
it
were
only
for
school
trustee
the
other
ladies
of
the
family
having
acquired
proper
pride
kept
in
the
back
of
the
house
so
as
not
to
be
tempted
to
look
out
of
the
front
windows
mrs
murchison
assumed
a
stoical
demeanour
and
made
a
pudding
though
there
was
no
reason
to
help
eliza
who
was
sufficiently
lacking
in
proper
pride
to
ask
the
milkman
whether
mr
lorne
wasn
t
sure
to
be
elected
down
there
now
the
milkman
said
he
guessed
the
best
man
ud
get
in
but
in
a
manner
which
roused
general
suspicion
as
to
which
he
had
himself
favoured
we
ll
finish
the
month
said
mrs
murchison
and
then
not
another
quart
do
we
take
from
him
a
gentleman
that
s
so
uncertain
when
he
s
asked
a
simple
the
butcher
came
and
brought
a
jovial
report
without
being
asked
for
it
said
he
was
the
first
man
to
hand
in
a
paper
at
his
place
but
they
were
piling
up
there
in
great
shape
for
mr
murchison
when
he
left
if
he
gets
in
he
gets
in
said
mrs
murchison
and
if
he
doesn
t
it
won
t
be
because
of
not
deserving
to
those
were
real
nice
cutlets
yesterday
mr
price
and
you
had
better
send
us
a
sirloin
for
tomorrow
about
six
pounds
but
it
doesn
t
matter
to
an
ounce
and
you
can
save
us
sweetbreads
for
sunday
i
like
yours
better
than
luff
john
murchison
alec
and
oliver
came
shortly
up
to
dinner
bringing
stirring
tales
from
the
field
there
was
the
personator
in
subdivision
six
of
a
dead
man
a
dead
grit
wanted
by
the
bloodhounds
of
the
other
side
and
tracked
to
the
reform
committee
room
where
he
was
ostensibly
and
publicly
taking
refuge
why
did
he
go
there
asked
stella
breathlessly
why
to
make
it
look
like
a
job
of
ours
of
course
said
her
brother
and
it
was
a
job
a
good
old
tory
fake
but
they
didn
t
calculate
on
bingham
and
bingham
s
memory
bingham
happened
to
be
in
the
committee
room
and
he
recognized
this
fellow
for
a
regular
political
tough
from
up
muskoka
way
where
they
get
six
for
a
bottle
of
canadian
and
ten
if
it
s
scotch
why
good
morning
says
bingham
thought
you
were
in
jail
and
just
then
he
catches
sight
of
a
couple
of
trailers
from
the
window
well
bingham
isn
t
just
lightning
smart
but
then
he
isn
t
slow
you
know
well
he
says
you
can
t
stop
here
and
in
another
second
he
was
throwing
the
fellow
out
threw
him
out
pretty
hard
too
i
guess
right
down
the
stairs
and
bingham
on
top
met
winter
s
men
at
the
door
the
next
time
you
want
information
from
the
headquarters
of
this
association
gentlemen
bingham
said
send
somebody
bingham
thought
the
man
was
just
any
kind
of
low
spy
at
first
but
when
they
claimed
him
for
personation
bingham
just
laughed
don
t
be
so
hard
on
your
friends
he
said
i
don
t
think
we
ll
hear
much
more
about
that
little
can
t
anything
be
done
to
any
of
them
asked
stella
not
today
of
course
but
when
there
s
we
ll
have
to
see
about
it
stella
said
alec
when
there
s
talking
about
bingham
oliver
told
them
you
know
bingham
s
story
about
jim
whelan
keeping
sober
for
two
weeks
for
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
to
vote
for
winter
wouldn
t
touch
a
thing
no
he
was
going
to
do
it
this
time
if
he
died
for
it
it
was
disagreeable
to
refuse
drinks
but
it
was
going
to
be
worth
his
while
been
boasting
about
the
janitorship
winter
was
to
give
him
if
he
got
in
well
in
he
came
to
number
eleven
this
morning
all
dressed
up
with
a
clean
collar
looking
thirstier
than
any
man
you
ever
saw
and
gets
his
paper
young
charlie
bingham
is
deputy
returning
officer
at
number
eleven
in
a
second
back
comes
whelan
this
ballot
s
marked
he
says
you
don
t
fool
is
it
says
charlie
taking
it
out
of
his
hand
that
s
very
wrong
jim
you
shouldn
t
have
marked
it
and
drops
it
into
the
oh
jim
was
wild
the
paper
had
gone
in
blank
you
see
and
he
d
lost
all
those
good
drunks
and
his
vote
too
he
was
going
to
have
charlie
s
blood
right
away
but
there
it
was
done
he
d
handed
in
his
ballot
he
couldn
t
have
they
all
laughed
i
fear
at
the
unfortunate
plight
of
the
too
suspicious
whelan
why
did
he
think
the
ballot
was
marked
asked
advena
oh
there
was
a
little
smudge
on
it
a
or
something
charlie
says
but
you
couldn
t
fool
i
hope
said
stella
meditatively
that
lorne
will
get
in
by
more
than
one
he
wouldn
t
like
to
owe
his
election
to
a
trick
like
that
don
t
you
be
at
all
alarmed
you
little
girlish
thing
replied
her
brother
lorne
will
get
in
by
five
john
murchison
had
listened
to
their
excited
talk
mostly
in
silence
going
on
with
his
dinner
as
if
that
and
nothing
else
were
the
important
matter
of
the
moment
mrs
murchison
had
had
this
idiosyncrasy
of
his
to
put
up
with
for
over
thirty
years
she
bore
it
now
as
long
as
she
could
father
she
exploded
at
last
do
you
think
lorne
will
get
in
by
five
hundred
mr
murchison
shook
his
head
and
bestowed
his
whole
attention
upon
the
paring
of
an
apple
if
he
kept
his
hopes
to
himself
he
also
kept
his
doubts
that
remains
to
be
seen
he
said
well
considering
it
s
your
own
son
i
think
you
might
show
a
little
more
confidence
said
mrs
murchison
no
thank
you
no
dessert
for
me
with
a
member
of
the
family
being
elected
or
not
for
a
seat
in
parliament
i
m
not
the
one
to
want
between
mr
murchison
and
the
milkman
that
morning
mrs
murchison
felt
almost
too
much
tried
by
the
superior
capacity
for
reticence
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
before
the
were
all
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
and
nine
before
that
officer
found
it
necessary
to
let
the
town
know
that
it
had
piled
up
a
majority
of
three
hundred
for
walter
winter
he
was
not
a
supporter
of
walter
winter
and
he
preferred
to
wait
until
the
returns
began
to
come
in
from
clayfield
and
the
townships
in
the
hope
that
they
would
make
the
serious
difference
that
was
required
of
them
the
results
were
flashed
one
after
the
other
to
the
total
from
the
windows
of
the
express
and
the
mercury
upon
the
cheering
crowd
that
gathered
in
market
square
there
were
moments
of
wild
elation
moments
of
deep
suspense
upon
both
sides
but
when
the
final
addition
and
subtraction
was
made
the
enthusiastic
voters
of
south
fox
including
jim
whelan
who
had
neglected
no
further
opportunity
read
with
yells
and
groans
hurrahs
and
catcalls
that
they
had
elected
mr
lorne
murchison
to
the
dominion
house
of
commons
by
a
majority
of
seventy
then
the
band
began
to
play
and
all
the
tin
whistles
to
rejoice
young
and
windle
had
the
grace
to
blow
their
sirens
and
across
the
excited
darkness
of
the
town
came
the
long
familiar
boom
of
the
murchison
stove
works
every
liberal
in
elgin
who
had
any
means
of
making
a
noise
made
it
from
the
window
of
the
association
committee
room
their
young
thanked
them
for
the
honour
they
had
done
him
while
his
mother
sat
in
the
cab
he
had
brought
her
down
in
and
applauded
vigorously
between
tears
and
his
father
took
congratulations
from
a
hundred
friendly
hands
they
all
went
home
in
a
torchlight
procession
the
band
always
playing
the
tin
whistles
always
performing
and
it
was
two
in
the
morning
before
the
occasion
could
in
any
sense
be
said
to
be
over
lights
burned
quite
as
late
however
in
the
conservative
committee
room
where
matters
were
being
arranged
to
bark
threateningly
at
the
heels
of
victory
next
day
victory
looked
like
something
that
might
be
made
to
turn
and
parley
a
majority
of
seventy
was
too
small
for
finality
her
attention
was
called
without
hours
delay
to
a
paragraph
in
the
elgin
mercury
plainly
authoritative
to
the
effect
that
the
election
of
mr
murchison
would
be
immediately
challenged
on
the
ground
of
the
infringement
in
the
electoral
district
of
moneida
of
certain
provisions
of
the
ontario
elections
act
with
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
candidate
whose
claim
to
the
contested
seat
it
was
confidently
expected
would
be
rendered
within
a
very
short
time
null
and
void
chapter
xxxi
you
can
never
trust
an
indian
said
mrs
murchison
at
the
anxious
family
council
well
do
i
remember
them
when
you
were
a
little
thing
advena
hanging
round
the
town
on
a
and
the
squaws
coming
to
the
back
door
with
their
tin
pails
of
raspberries
to
sell
and
just
knowing
english
enough
to
ask
a
big
price
for
them
but
it
was
on
the
squaws
we
depended
in
those
days
or
go
without
raspberry
preserves
for
the
winter
things
they
were
with
their
three
or
four
coloured
petticoats
and
their
papooses
on
their
backs
and
for
dirt
but
i
thought
they
were
all
gone
long
there
are
enough
of
them
left
to
make
trouble
all
right
said
alec
they
don
t
dress
up
like
they
used
to
and
i
guess
they
send
the
papooses
to
kindergarten
now
but
you
ll
find
plenty
of
them
lying
around
any
time
there
s
nothing
to
do
but
vote
and
get
allowing
for
the
natural
exaggeration
of
partisanship
the
facts
about
the
remaining
red
man
of
moneida
were
much
as
alec
described
them
on
he
slid
easily
unless
you
looked
twice
into
what
the
express
continues
to
call
the
farming
community
invariably
if
you
did
look
twice
you
would
note
that
his
stiff
felt
hat
was
an
inch
taller
in
the
crown
than
those
worn
generally
by
the
farming
community
the
pathetic
assertion
perhaps
of
an
old
sovereignty
invariably
too
his
coat
and
trousers
betrayed
a
form
within
which
in
the
effort
at
adaptation
had
become
and
lank
of
leg
and
the
brown
skin
was
there
to
be
noticed
though
you
might
pass
it
by
and
the
high
and
the
liquidly
muddy
eye
he
had
taken
on
the
signs
of
civilization
at
the
level
which
he
occupied
the
farming
community
had
lent
him
its
look
of
shrewdness
in
small
bargains
and
its
rakish
sophistication
in
garments
nor
could
you
always
assume
with
certainty
except
at
fox
county
fairs
and
elections
that
he
was
intoxicated
so
much
government
had
done
for
him
in
fox
county
where
the
reservation
nursing
the
dying
fragment
of
his
race
testified
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
political
compunction
out
in
the
wide
spaces
of
the
west
he
still
protects
his
savagery
they
know
an
indian
there
today
as
far
as
they
can
see
him
without
a
second
glance
and
in
moneida
upon
he
still
as
alec
said
made
perhaps
it
would
be
more
to
the
fact
to
say
that
he
presented
the
elements
of
which
trouble
is
made
civilization
had
given
him
a
vote
not
with
his
coat
and
trousers
but
shortly
after
and
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
keep
it
anywhere
but
in
his
pocket
whence
the
transfer
was
easy
and
could
be
made
in
different
ways
the
law
contemplated
only
one
the
straight
drop
into
the
but
the
boys
had
other
views
the
law
represented
one
level
of
political
sentiment
the
boys
represented
another
both
parties
represented
the
law
both
parties
were
represented
by
the
boys
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
south
fox
election
the
boys
had
been
active
in
moneida
there
are
as
we
know
two
kinds
of
activity
on
these
occasions
one
being
set
to
observe
the
other
and
walter
winter
s
boys
while
presumably
neglecting
no
legitimate
opportunity
of
their
own
claimed
to
have
been
highly
successful
in
detecting
the
methods
of
the
other
side
the
indians
owed
their
holdings
their
allowances
their
school
and
their
protecting
superintendent
squire
ormiston
to
a
conservative
government
it
made
a
grateful
bond
of
which
a
later
conservative
government
was
not
perhaps
unaware
when
it
added
the
ballot
to
its
previous
benefits
the
indians
therefore
on
were
supposed
to
go
solid
for
the
candidate
in
whom
they
had
been
taught
to
see
good
will
if
they
did
not
go
quite
solid
the
other
side
might
point
to
the
evolution
of
the
political
idea
in
every
dissentient
a
gladdening
spectacle
indeed
on
which
however
the
other
side
seldom
showed
any
desire
to
dwell
hitherto
the
desires
and
intentions
of
the
reserve
had
been
exemplified
in
its
superintendent
squire
ormiston
had
never
led
his
wards
to
the
polls
there
were
strong
reasons
against
that
but
the
squire
made
no
secret
of
his
politics
either
before
or
unluckily
after
he
changed
them
the
indians
had
always
known
that
they
were
voting
on
the
same
side
as
de
they
were
likely
the
friends
of
mr
winter
thought
to
know
now
that
they
were
voting
on
a
different
side
this
was
the
secret
of
mr
winter
s
friends
unusual
diligence
on
in
moneida
the
mere
indication
of
a
wish
on
the
part
of
the
superintendent
would
constitute
undue
influence
in
the
eye
of
the
law
the
squire
was
not
the
most
discreet
of
men
often
before
it
had
been
the
joke
of
conservative
councils
how
near
the
old
man
had
come
to
making
a
case
for
the
grits
in
connection
with
this
chief
or
that
i
will
not
say
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
famous
letter
from
queen
victoria
affectionately
bidding
her
indian
children
to
vote
for
the
conservative
candidate
but
perhaps
he
had
not
adhered
to
the
strictest
interpretation
of
the
law
which
gave
him
fatherly
influence
in
everything
pertaining
to
his
charges
interests
temporal
and
spiritual
excepting
only
their
sacred
privilege
of
the
ballot
he
may
even
have
held
it
in
some
genial
derision
their
sacred
privilege
it
would
be
natural
he
had
been
there
among
them
in
unquestioned
authority
so
long
now
it
had
assumed
an
importance
the
squire
looked
at
it
with
the
ardour
of
a
converted
eye
when
he
told
mr
farquharson
that
he
could
bring
moneida
with
him
to
a
liberal
victory
he
thought
and
spoke
of
the
farmers
of
the
township
not
of
his
wards
of
the
reserve
yet
as
the
day
approached
these
would
infallibly
become
voters
in
his
eyes
to
swell
or
to
diminish
the
sum
of
moneida
s
loyalty
to
the
empire
they
remembered
all
this
in
the
committee
room
of
his
old
party
the
squire
they
said
to
one
another
will
give
himself
away
this
time
if
ever
he
then
young
murchison
hadn
t
known
any
better
than
to
spend
the
best
part
of
the
day
out
there
and
there
were
a
dozen
witnesses
to
swear
that
old
ormiston
introduced
him
to
three
or
four
of
the
chiefs
that
was
basis
enough
for
the
boys
detailed
to
watch
moneida
basis
enough
in
the
end
for
a
petition
constructed
to
travel
to
the
high
court
at
toronto
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
null
and
void
the
election
of
mr
lorne
murchison
and
transferring
the
south
fox
seat
to
the
candidate
of
the
opposite
party
that
possibility
had
been
promptly
frustrated
by
a
cross
petition
there
was
enough
evidence
in
subdivision
eleven
according
to
bingham
to
void
the
tory
returns
on
six
different
counts
but
the
sold
by
peter
finnigan
to
mr
winter
for
five
dollars
would
answer
all
practical
purposes
it
was
a
mouser
bingham
said
and
it
would
settle
winter
they
would
have
plenty
of
other
charges
good
and
ready
if
finnigan
s
cat
should
fail
them
but
bingham
didn
t
think
the
court
would
get
to
anything
else
he
had
great
confidence
in
the
cat
the
petitions
had
been
lodged
with
promptness
evidence
as
mr
winter
remarked
is
like
a
good
many
other
things
better
when
it
s
hot
especially
the
kind
you
get
on
the
to
which
when
he
heard
it
bingham
observed
sarcastically
that
the
cat
would
keep
the
necessary
thousand
dollars
were
ready
on
each
side
the
day
after
the
election
lodged
in
court
the
next
counsel
were
as
promptly
engaged
the
liberals
selected
cruickshank
and
the
suit
against
the
elected
candidate
beginning
with
charges
against
his
agents
in
the
town
was
shortly
in
full
hearing
before
the
judges
sent
from
toronto
to
try
it
meanwhile
the
elgin
mercury
had
shown
enterprise
in
getting
hold
of
moneida
evidence
and
foolhardiness
as
the
express
pointed
out
in
publishing
it
before
the
matter
was
reached
in
court
there
was
no
foolhardiness
in
printing
what
the
express
knew
about
finnigan
s
cat
it
was
just
a
common
cat
and
walter
winter
paid
five
dollars
for
it
finnigan
declaring
that
if
mr
winter
hadn
t
filled
him
up
with
bad
whiskey
before
the
bargain
he
wouldn
t
have
let
her
go
under
ten
he
was
that
fond
of
the
creature
the
express
pointed
out
that
this
was
grasping
of
finnigan
as
the
cat
had
never
left
him
and
mr
winter
showed
no
intention
of
taking
her
away
but
there
was
nothing
sub
judice
about
the
cat
finnigan
before
he
sobered
up
had
let
her
completely
out
of
the
bag
it
was
otherwise
with
the
charges
that
were
to
be
made
according
to
the
mercury
on
the
evidence
of
chief
joseph
fry
and
another
member
of
his
tribe
to
the
effect
that
he
and
his
conservative
friends
had
been
instructed
by
squire
ormiston
and
mr
murchison
to
vote
on
this
occasion
for
both
the
candidates
thereby
producing
when
the
box
was
opened
eleven
inscribed
with
two
crosses
instead
of
one
and
valueless
here
should
the
charges
against
a
distinguished
and
highly
respected
government
official
fail
as
in
the
opinion
of
the
express
they
undoubtedly
would
fail
of
substantiation
was
a
big
libel
case
all
dressed
and
ready
and
looking
for
the
mercury
office
foolish
foolish
wrote
mr
williams
at
the
close
of
his
editorial
comments
very
they
ve
made
no
case
so
far
mr
murchison
assured
the
family
i
saw
williams
on
my
way
up
and
he
says
the
evidence
of
that
corner
grocery
fellow
what
s
his
name
went
all
to
pieces
this
morning
oliver
was
in
court
he
says
one
of
the
judges
hooke
lost
his
patience
they
won
t
do
anything
with
the
town
charges
alec
said
and
they
know
it
they
re
saving
themselves
for
moneida
and
old
man
well
i
heartily
wish
said
mrs
murchison
in
a
tone
of
grievance
with
the
world
at
large
and
if
you
were
not
responsible
you
might
keep
out
of
the
way
i
heartily
wish
that
lorne
had
stayed
at
home
that
day
and
not
got
mixed
up
with
old
man
they
ll
find
it
pretty
hard
to
fix
anything
on
lorne
said
alec
but
i
guess
the
squire
did
go
off
his
head
a
have
they
anything
more
than
indian
evidence
asked
advena
we
don
t
know
what
they
ve
got
said
her
brother
darkly
and
we
won
t
till
wednesday
when
they
expect
to
get
round
to
indian
evidence
will
be
a
poor
dependence
in
cruickshank
s
hands
mr
murchison
told
them
with
a
chuckle
they
say
this
chief
joseph
fry
is
going
about
complaining
that
he
always
got
three
dollars
for
one
vote
before
and
this
time
he
expected
six
for
two
and
got
nothing
chief
joseph
fry
exclaimed
alec
they
make
me
tired
with
their
chief
josephs
and
chief
henrys
white
clam
shell
that
was
the
name
he
got
when
he
wasn
t
that

the
name
remarked
advena
that
he
probably
votes
well
said
mrs
murchison
it
was
very
kind
of
squire
ormiston
to
give
lorne
his
support
but
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
moneida
is
concerned
he
would
have
done
better
no
i
guess
he
wouldn

said
alec
moneida
came
right
round
with
the
squire
outside
the
reserve
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
majority
there
we
would
have
lost
the
election
the
old
man
worked
hard
and
lorne
is
grateful
to
him
and
so
he
ought
to
if
they
carry
the
case
against
lorne
said
stella
he
ll
be
disqualified
for
seven

if
they
prove

chapter
xxxii
it
was
late
afternoon
when
the
train
from
the
west
deposited
hugh
finlay
upon
the
elgin
platform
the
close
of
one
of
those
wide
wet
uncertain
february
days
when
the
call
of
spring
is
on
the
wind
though
spring
is
weeks
away
the
lights
of
the
town
flashed
and
glimmered
down
the
streets
under
the
bare
swaying
maple
branches
the
early
evening
was
full
of
soft
bluster
the
air
was
conscious
with
an
appeal
of
nature
vague
yet
poignant
the
young
man
caught
at
the
strange
sympathy
that
seemed
to
be
abroad
for
his
spirit
he
walked
to
his
house
courting
it
troubled
by
it
they
were
expecting
him
that
evening
at
dr
drummond
s
and
there
it
was
his
intention
to
go
but
on
his
way
he
would
call
for
a
moment
to
see
advena
murchison
he
had
something
to
tell
her
it
would
be
news
of
interest
at
dr
drummond
s
also
but
it
was
of
no
consequence
within
an
hour
or
so
when
they
should
receive
it
there
while
it
was
of
great
consequence
that
advena
should
hear
it
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
from
him
there
is
no
weighing
or
analysing
the
burden
of
such
a
necessity
as
this
it
simply
is
important
it
makes
its
own
weight
and
those
whom
it
concerns
must
put
aside
other
matters
until
it
has
been
accomplished
he
would
tell
her
they
would
accept
it
for
a
moment
together
a
moment
during
which
he
would
also
ascertain
whether
she
was
well
and
strong
with
a
good
chance
of
happiness
god
protect
her
in
the
future
that
he
should
not
know
then
he
would
go
on
to
dr
drummond

the
wind
had
risen
when
he
went
out
again
it
blew
a
longer
blast
and
the
trees
made
a
steady
sonorous
rhythm
in
it
the
sky
was
full
of
clouds

dashed
upon
the
track
of
a
failing
moon
there
was
portent
everywhere
and
a
hint
of
tumult
at
the
end
of
the
street
no
two
ways
led
from
finlay
s
house
to
his
first
destination
river
street
made
an
angle
with
that
on
which
the
murchisons
lived
half
a
mile
to
the
corner
and
the
other
way
drops
drove
in
his
face
as
he
strode
along
against
the
wind
stilling
his
unquiet
heart
that
leaped
before
him
to
that
brief
interview
as
he
took
the
single
turning
he
came
into
the
full
blast
of
the
veering
irresolute
storm
the
street
was
solitary
and
full
of
the
sound
of
the
blown
trees
wild
and
uplifting
far
down
the
figure
of
a
woman
wavered
before
the
wind
across
the
zone
of
a
blurred
she
was
coming
toward
him
he
bent
his
head
and
lowered
his
umbrella
and
lost
sight
of
her
as
they
approached
she
with
the
storm
behind
her
driven
with
hardly
more
resistance
than
the
last
year
s
blackened
leaves
that
blew
with
her
he
assailed
by
it
and
making
the
best
way
he
could
certainly
the
wind
was
taking
her
part
and
his
when
in
another
moment
her
skirt
whipped
against
him
and
he
saw
her
face
glimmer
out
a
mere
wreck
of
lines
and
shadows
it
seemed
in
the
livid
light
with
suddenly
perceiving
eyes
and
lips
that
cried
his
name
she
had
on
a
hat
and
a
cloak
but
carried
no
umbrella
and
her
hands
were
bare
and
wet
pitifully
the
storm
blew
her
into
his
arms
a
tossed
and
straying
thing
that
could
not
speak
for
sobs
pitifully
and
with
a
rough
incoherent
sound
he
gathered
and
held
her
in
that
refuge
a
rising
fear
and
a
great
solicitude
laid
a
finger
upon
his
craving
embrace
of
her
he
had
a
sense
of
something
strangely
different
in
her
of
the
unknown
irremediable
yet
she
was
there
in
his
arms
as
she
had
never
been
before
her
plight
but
made
her
in
a
manner
sweeter
the
storm
that
brought
her
barricaded
them
in
the
empty
spaces
of
the
street
with
a
divinely
entreating
solitude
he
had
been
prepared
to
meet
her
in
the
lighted
decorum
of
her
father
s
house
and
he
knew
what
he
should
say
he
was
not
prepared
to
take
her
out
of
the
tempest
helpless
and
weeping
and
lost
for
the
harbour
of
his
heart
and
nothing
could
he
say
he
locked
his
lips
against
all
that
came
murmuring
to
them
but
his
arms
tightened
about
her
and
he
drew
her
into
the
shelter
of
a
wall
that
jutted
out
in
the
irregular
street
and
there
they
stood
and
clung
together
in
a
long
close
broken
silence
that
covered
the
downfall
of
her
spirit
it
was
the
moment
of
their
great
experience
of
one
another
never
again
in
whatever
crisis
could
either
know
so
deep
so
wonderful
a
fathoming
of
the
other
soul
once
as
it
passed
advena
put
up
her
hand
and
touched
his
cheek
there
were
tears
on
it
and
she
trembled
and
wound
her
arm
about
his
neck
and
held
up
her
face
to
his
no
he
muttered
and
crushed
it
against
his
breast
there
without
complaint
she
let
it
lie
she
was
all
submission
to
him
his
blood
leaped
and
his
spirit
groaned
with
the
knowledge
of
it
why
did
you
come
out
why
did
you
come
dear
he
said
at
last
i
don
t
know
there
was
such
a
wind
i
could
not
stay
in
the
she
spoke
timidly
in
a
voice
that
should
have
been
new
to
him
but
that
it
was
above
all
her
voice
i
was
on
my
way
to
i
know
i
thought
you
might
perhaps
come
if
you
had
not
i
think
i
was
on
my
way
to
it
seemed
not
unnatural
did
you
find
any
message
from
me
when
you
came
she
asked
presently
in
a
quieted
almost
a
contented
tone
it
shot
the
message
before
his
eyes
though
he
had
seen
it
no
message
in
the
preoccupation
of
his
arrival
i
found
a
rose
on
my
he
told
her
and
the
rose
stood
for
him
in
a
wonder
of
tenderness
looking
back
i
smuggled
it
in
she
confessed
i
knew
your
old
servant
she
used
to
be
with
us
the
others
from
dr
drummond
s
have
been
there
all
day
making
it
warm
and
comfortable
for
you
i
had
no
right
to
do
anything
like
that
but
i
had
the
right
hadn
t
i
to
bring
the
rose
i
don
t
know
he
answered
her
how
we
are
to
bear
she
shrank
away
from
him
a
little
as
if
at
a
glimpse
of
a
surgeon
s
knife
we
are
not
to
bear
it
she
said
eagerly
the
rose
is
to
tell
you
that
i
didn
t
mean
it
when
i
left
it
to
be
anything
more
more
than
a
rose
but
now
i
do
i
didn
t
even
know
when
i
came
out
tonight
but
now
i
do
we
aren
t
to
bear
it
hugh
i
don
t
want
it
so
now
i
can
t
can
t
have
it
she
came
nearer
to
him
again
and
caught
with
her
two
hands
the
lapels
of
his
coat
he
closed
his
own
over
them
and
looked
down
at
her
in
that
which
still
claimed
and
held
her
advena
he
whispered
out
of
the
sudden
clamour
in
his
mind
she
can
t
be
she
isn
t
nothing
has
happened
to
her
she
smiled
faintly
but
her
eyes
were
again
full
of
fear
at
his
implication
of
the
only
way
oh
no
she
said
but
you
have
been
away
and
she
has
come
i
have
seen
her
and
oh
she
won
t
care
hugh
she
won
t
her
asking
straining
face
seemed
to
gather
and
reflect
all
the
light
there
was
in
the
shifting
night
about
them
the
rain
had
stopped
but
the
wind
still
hurtled
past
whirling
the
leaves
from
one
darkness
to
another
they
were
as
isolated
as
outlawed
there
in
the
wild
wet
wind
as
they
were
in
the
confusion
of
their
own
souls
we
must
care
he
said
helplessly
clinging
to
the
sound
and
form
of
the
words
oh
no
she
cried
no
no
indeed
i
know
now
what
is
possible
and
what
is
not
for
an
instant
her
eyes
searched
the
rigid
lines
of
his
face
in
astonishment
in
their
struggle
to
establish
the
impossible
she
had
been
so
far
ahead
so
greatly
the
more
confident
and
daring
had
tempted
him
to
such
heights
scorning
every
dizzy
verge
that
now
when
she
turned
quite
back
from
their
adventure
humbly
confessing
it
too
hard
she
could
not
understand
how
he
should
continue
to
set
himself
doggedly
toward
it
perhaps
too
she
trusted
unconsciously
in
her
prerogative
he
loved
her
and
she
him
before
she
would
not
now
she
would
before
she
had
preferred
an
ideal
to
the
desire
of
her
heart
now
it
lay
about
her
her
strenuous
heart
had
pulled
it
down
to
foolish
ruin
and
how
should
she
lie
abased
with
it
and
see
him
still
erect
and
full
of
the
deed
they
had
to
do
come
he
said
let
me
take
you
home
dear
and
at
that
and
some
accent
in
it
that
struck
again
at
hope
she
sank
at
his
feet
in
a
torrent
of
weeping
clasping
them
and
entreating
him
oh
send
her
away
send
her
away
he
lifted
her
and
was
obliged
literally
to
support
her
her
hat
had
fallen
off
he
stroked
her
hair
and
murmured
such
comfort
to
her
as
we
have
for
children
in
their
extremity
of
which
the
burden
is
chiefly
love
and
don
t
she
grew
gradually
quieter
drawing
one
knows
not
what
restitution
from
the
intrinsic
in
him
but
there
was
no
pride
in
her
and
when
she
said
let
me
go
home
now
it
was
the
broken
word
of
hapless
defeat
they
struggled
together
out
into
the
boisterous
street
and
once
or
twice
she
failed
and
had
to
stop
and
turn
then
she
would
cling
to
a
wall
or
a
tree
putting
his
help
aside
with
a
gesture
in
which
there
was
again
some
pitiful
trace
of
renunciation
they
went
almost
without
a
word
each
treading
upon
the
heart
of
the
other
toward
the
gulf
that
was
to
come
they
reached
it
at
the
murchisons
gate
and
there
they
paused
as
briefly
as
possible
since
pause
was
torture
and
he
told
her
what
he
could
not
tell
her
before
i
have
accepted
the
charge
of
the
white
water
mission
station
in
alberta
he
said
i
too
learned
very
soon
after
i
left
you
what
was
possible
and
what
was
not
i
go
as
soon
as
things
can
be
set
in
order
here
my
dear
love
and
may
god
help
us
she
looked
at
him
with
a
pitiful
effort
at
a
steady
lip
i
must
try
to
believe
it
she
said
and
afterward
when
it
comes
true
for
you
remember
this
i
was
then
he
saw
her
pass
into
her
father
s
house
and
he
took
the
road
to
his
duty
and
dr
drummond
s
his
extremity
was
very
great
through
it
lines
came
to
him
from
the
beautiful
archaic
inheritance
of
his
church
he
strode
along
hearing
them
again
and
again
in
the
dying
storm
so
i
do
stretch
my
hands
to
thee
my
help
alone
thou
only
understands
all
my
complaint
and
moan
he
listened
to
the
prayer
on
the
wind
which
seemed
to
offer
it
for
him
listened
and
was
gravely
touched
but
he
himself
was
far
from
the
throes
of
supplication
he
was
looking
for
the
forces
of
his
soul
and
by
the
time
he
reached
dr
drummond
s
door
we
may
suppose
that
he
had
found
them
sarah
who
let
him
in
cried
how
wet
you
are
mr
finlay
and
took
his
overcoat
to
dry
in
the
kitchen
the
scotch
ladies
she
told
him
and
mrs
forsyth
had
gone
out
to
tea
but
they
would
be
back
right
away
and
meanwhile
the
doctor
was
expecting
him
in
the
study
he
knew
the
way
finlay
did
know
the
way
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
time
for
him
to
forget
it
he
had
not
crossed
dr
drummond
s
threshold
since
the
night
on
which
the
doctor
had
done
all
as
he
would
have
said
that
was
humanly
possible
to
bring
him
finlay
to
reason
upon
the
matter
of
his
incredible
entanglement
in
bross
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
ajar
however
as
if
impatient
and
dr
drummond
himself
standing
in
it
heightened
that
appearance
with
his
come
you
in
finlay
come
you
in
the
doctor
looked
at
the
young
man
in
a
manner
even
more
acute
more
shrewd
and
more
kindly
than
was
his
wont
his
eye
searched
finlay
thoroughly
and
his
smile
seemed
to
broaden
as
his
glance
travelled
man
he
said
you
re
shivering
and
rolled
him
an
armchair
near
the
fire
the
fellow
came
into
the
room
he
would
say
when
he
told
the
story
afterward
to
the
person
most
concerned
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
stake
this
is
extraordinary
weather
we
are
having
but
i
think
the
storm
is
passing
i
hope
said
finlay
that
my
aunt
and
miss
cameron
are
well
i
understand
they
are
oh
very
well
finely
they
re
out
at
present
but
you
ll
see
them
an
excellent
voyage
over
they
had
just
the
eight
days
but
we
ll
be
doing
it
in
less
than
that
when
the
new
fast
line
is
running
to
halifax
but
four
days
of
actual
ocean
travelling
they
say
now
it
will
take
four
days
from
imperial
shore
to
shore
that
should
incorporate
us
that
should
bring
them
out
and
take
us
the
doctor
had
not
taken
a
seat
himself
but
was
pacing
the
study
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
a
touch
of
embarrassment
seemed
added
to
the
inveterate
habit
i
hear
the
ladies
had
pleasant
finlay
remarked
capital
capital
you
won
t
smoke
i
know
nothing
about
these
cigars
they
re
some
grant
left
behind
him
a
chimney
that
man
grant
well
finlay
he
threw
himself
into
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
to
surely
said
finlay
restively
it
has
all
been
said
no
it
has
not
all
been
said
dr
drummond
retorted
no
it
has
not
there
s
more
to
be
said
and
you
must
hear
it
finlay
with
such
patience
as
you
have
but
i
speak
the
truth
when
i
say
that
i
don
t
know
how
to
the
young
man
gave
him
opportunity
gazing
silently
into
the
fire
he
was
hardly
aware
that
dr
drummond
had
again
left
his
seat
when
he
started
violently
at
a
clap
on
the
shoulder
finlay
exclaimed
the
doctor
you
won
t
be
offended
no
you
couldn
t
be
offended
it
was
wholly
inexplicable
at
what
asked
hugh
finlay
should
i
be
offended
again
with
a
deep
sigh
the
doctor
dropped
into
his
chair
i
see
i
must
begin
at
the
beginning
he
said
but
finlay
with
sudden
intuition
had
risen
and
stood
before
him
trembling
with
a
hand
against
the
mantelpiece
no
he
said
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
me
of
importance
for
god
s
sake
begin
at
the
some
vibration
in
his
voice
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
doctor
banishing
as
it
travelled
every
irrelevant
thing
that
it
encountered
then
the
end
is
this
finlay
he
said
the
young
woman
miss
christie
cameron
whom
you
were
so
wilfully
bound
and
determined
to
marry
has
thrown
you
over
that
is
if
you
will
give
her
back
her
word
has
jilted
you
that
is
if
you
ll
let
her
away
has
thought
entirely
better
of
the
he
stared
out
of
his
great
sockets
of
eyes
as
if
the
sky
had
fallen
dr
drummond
would
say
recounting
it
for
for
what
reason
asked
finlay
hardly
yet
able
to
distinguish
between
the
sound
of
disaster
and
the
sense
that
lay
beneath
may
i
begin
at
the
beginning
asked
the
doctor
and
hugh
silently
nodded
he
sat
there
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
me
twisting
his
fingers
i
might
have
been
in
a
dr
drummond
would
explain
to
her
she
came
here
miss
cameron
with
that
good
woman
mrs
kilbannon
it
will
be
three
weeks
next
monday
he
said
with
all
the
air
of
beginning
a
story
that
would
be
well
worth
hearing
and
i
wasn
t
very
well
pleased
to
see
her
for
reasons
that
you
know
however
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
i
met
them
both
at
the
station
and
i
own
to
you
that
i
thought
when
i
made
miss
cameron
s
acquaintance
that
you
were
getting
better
than
you
deserved
in
the
circumstances
you
were
a
thousand
miles
away
now
that
was
a
fortunate
thing
and
she
and
mrs
kilbannon
just
stayed
here
and
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
and
that
was
so
comfortable
that
anyone
could
see
with
half
an
eye
the
doctor
s
own
eye
twinkled
so
far
as
miss
cameron
was
concerned
that
she
wasn
t
pining
in
any
sense
of
the
word
but
i
wasn
t
sorry
for
you
finlay
on
that
he
stopped
to
laugh
enjoyingly
and
finlay
blushed
like
a
girl
i
just
let
matters
bide
and
went
about
my
own
business
though
after
poor
mrs
forsyth
here
a
good
woman
enough
but
the
brains
of
a
rabbit
it
was
pleasant
to
find
these
intelligent
ladies
at
every
meal
and
wonderful
how
quick
they
were
at
picking
up
the
differences
between
the
points
of
church
administration
here
and
at
home
that
was
a
thing
i
noticed
particularly
in
miss
cameron
matters
went
smoothly
enough
smoothly
enough
till
one
afternoon
that
foolish
creature
advena
murchison
finlay
started
came
here
to
pay
a
call
on
miss
cameron
and
mrs
kilbannon
it
was
well
and
kindly
meant
but
it
was
not
a
thing
to
do
i
didn
t
exactly
make
it
out
but
it
seems
that
she
came
all
because
of
you
and
on
account
of
you
and
the
ladies
didn
t
understand
it
and
mrs
kilbannon
came
to
me
my
word
but
there
was
a
woman
to
deal
with
who
was
this
young
lady
and
what
was
she
to
you
that
she
should
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
in
your
name
without
doubt
he
put
up
a
staying
hand
it
was
foolish
of
advena
and
what
sort
of
freedom
and
how
far
and
why
and
what
way
and
i
tell
you
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
quiet
her
is
miss
cameron
distressed
about
it
said
i
not
a
bit
said
she
but
i
am
and
i
must
have
the
rights
of
this
matter
said
she
if
i
have
to
put
it
to
my
nephew
it
was
at
that
point
finlay
that
the
idea
just
then
that
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
well
i
won
t
say
absolutely
but
practically
for
the
first
time
why
can
t
this
matter
be
arranged
on
a
basis
to
suit
all
parties
so
i
said
to
her
mrs
kilbannon
i
said
if
you
had
reasonable
grounds
for
it
do
you
think
you
could
persuade
your
niece
not
to
marry
hugh
finlay
wait
patience
he
held
up
his
hand
and
finlay
gripped
the
arm
of
his
chair
again
she
just
stared
at
me
are
you
gone
clean
daft
dr
drummond
she
said
there
could
be
no
grounds
serious
enough
for
that
i
will
not
believe
that
hugh
finlay
has
compromised
himself
in
any
i
had
to
stop
her
i
was
obliged
to
tell
her
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
nothing
of
the
kind
and
later
on
i
ll
have
to
settle
with
my
conscience
about
that
i
meant
i
said
the
reasonable
grounds
of
an
alternative
an
alternative
said
she
to
cut
a
long
story
short
continued
the
doctor
leaning
forward
always
with
the
finger
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
to
emphasize
what
he
said
i
represented
to
mrs
kilbannon
that
miss
cameron
was
not
in
sentimental
relations
toward
you
that
she
had
some
reason
to
suspect
you
of
having
placed
your
affections
elsewhere
and
that
i
myself
was
very
much
taken
up
with
what
i
had
seen
of
miss
cameron
in
brief
i
said
to
mrs
kilbannon
that
if
miss
cameron
saw
no
objection
to
altering
the
arrangements
to
admit
of
it
i
should
be
pleased
to
marry
her
myself
the
thing
was
much
more
suitable
in
every
way
i
was
years
of
age
last
week
i
told
her
but
i
said
miss
cameron
is
or
seven
if
she
s
a
day
and
finlay
there
would
be
like
nothing
but
a
son
to
her
i
can
offer
her
a
good
home
and
the
minister
s
pew
in
a
church
that
any
woman
might
be
proud
of
and
though
far
be
it
from
me
i
said
to
depreciate
mission
work
either
home
or
foreign
miss
cameron
in
that
field
would
be
little
less
than
thrown
away
think
it
over
i
said
well
she
was
pleased
i
could
see
that
but
she
didn
t
half
like
the
idea
of
changing
the
original
notion
it
was
leaving
you
to
your
own
devices
that
weighed
most
with
her
against
it
she
d
set
her
heart
on
seeing
you
married
with
her
approval
so
i
said
to
her
to
make
an
end
of
it
well
mrs
kilbannon
i
said
suppose
we
say
no
more
about
it
for
the
present
i
think
i
see
the
finger
of
providence
in
this
matter
but
you
ll
talk
it
over
with
miss
cameron
and
we
ll
all
just
make
it
for
the
next
few
days
the
subject
of
quiet
and
sober
reflection
maybe
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
ll
think
better
of
it
myself
though
that
is
not
my
i
think
she
said
we
ll
just
leave
it
to
as
the
doctor
went
on
with
his
tale
relaxation
had
stolen
dumbly
about
finlay
s
brow
and
lips
he
dropped
from
the
plane
of
his
own
absorption
to
the
humorous
common
sense
of
the
recital
it
claimed
and
held
him
with
infinite
solace
his
eyes
had
something
like
the
light
of
laughter
in
them
flashing
behind
a
cloud
as
he
fixed
them
on
dr
drummond
and
said
and
did
you
we
did
said
dr
drummond
getting
up
once
more
from
his
chair
and
playing
complacently
with
his
as
he
took
another
turn
about
the
study
we
left
it
to
miss
cameron
and
the
result
is
the
doctor
stopped
sharply
and
wheeled
round
upon
finlay
the
result
is
why
the
upshot
seems
to
be
that
i
ve
cut
you
out
man
finlay
measured
the
little
doctor
standing
there
twisting
his
beaming
with
achieved
satisfaction
in
a
consuming
desire
to
know
how
far
chance
had
been
kind
to
him
and
how
far
he
had
to
be
simply
unspeakably
grateful
he
stared
in
silence
occupied
with
his
great
debt
it
was
like
him
that
that
and
not
his
liberty
should
be
first
in
his
mind
we
who
have
not
his
opportunity
may
find
it
more
difficult
to
decide
but
from
our
private
knowledge
of
dr
drummond
we
may
remember
what
poor
finlay
probably
forgot
at
the
moment
that
even
when
pitted
against
providence
the
doctor
was
a
man
of
great
determination
the
young
fellow
got
up
still
speechless
and
confronted
dr
drummond
he
was
troubled
for
something
to
say
the
chambers
of
his
brain
seemed
empty
or
reiterating
foolish
sounds
he
pressed
the
hand
the
minister
offered
him
and
his
lips
quivered
then
a
light
came
into
his
face
and
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
i
ll
say
this
for
myself
chuckled
dr
drummond
it
was
no
hard
finlay
looked
at
him
and
smiled
it
would
not
be
sir
he
said
lamely
dr
drummond
cast
a
shrewd
glance
at
him
and
dropped
the
tone
of
banter
aye
i
know
it
s
no
joking
matter
he
said
and
with
a
hand
behind
the
young
man
s
elbow
he
half
pushed
him
to
the
door
and
took
out
his
watch
he
must
always
be
starting
somebody
something
in
the
right
direction
the
doctor
it
s
not
much
after
nine
finlay
he
said
i
notice
the
stars
are
it
had
the
feeling
of
a
colloquial
benediction
and
finlay
carried
it
with
him
all
the
way
it
was
nevertheless
nearly
ten
when
he
reached
her
father
s
house
so
late
that
the
family
had
dispersed
for
the
night
yet
he
had
the
hardihood
to
ring
and
the
hour
blessed
them
both
for
advena
on
the
stair
catching
who
knows
what
of
presage
out
of
the
sound
turned
and
found
him
at
the
threshold
herself
chapter
xxxiii
i
understand
how
you
must
feel
in
the
matter
murchison
said
henry
cruickshank
it
s
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
you
should
want
to
clear
yourself
definitely
especially
as
you
say
since
the
charges
have
been
given
such
wide
publicity
on
the
other
hand
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
you
exaggerate
the
inference
that
will
be
drawn
from
our
consenting
to
saw
off
with
the
other
side
on
the
two
principal
the
inference
will
be
said
lorne
that
there
s
not
a
pin
to
choose
between
winter
s
political
honesty
and
my
own
i
m
no
pharisee
but
i
don
t
think
i
can
sit
down
under
that
i
can
t
impair
my
possible
usefulness
by
accepting
a
slur
upon
my
reputation
at
the
very
politics
are
very
impersonal
it
wouldn
t
be
remembered
a
winter
of
course
said
young
murchison
moodily
doesn
t
want
to
take
any
chances
he
knows
he
s
done
for
if
we
go
on
seven
years
for
him
would
put
him
pretty
well
out
of
politics
and
it
would
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
to
fight
it
over
again
there
s
nothing
he
would
like
better
to
see
than
another
writ
for
south
that
s
all
right
the
lawyer
responded
but
moneida
doesn
t
look
altogether
pleasant
you
know
we
may
have
good
grounds
for
supposing
that
the
court
will
find
you
clear
of
that
business
but
ormiston
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
was
playing
the
fool
down
there
for
a
week
before
and
there
are
three
or
four
yellow
dogs
and
red
feathers
only
too
anxious
to
pay
back
a
grudge
on
him
we
ll
have
to
fight
again
there
s
no
doubt
about
that
the
only
question
is
whether
we
ll
ruin
ormiston
first
or
not
have
you
seen
bingham
i
know
what
bingham
thinks
said
lorne
impatiently
the
squire
s
position
is
a
different
consideration
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
however
i
ll
go
across
to
the
committee
room
now
and
talk
it
it
is
doubtful
whether
young
murchison
knew
all
that
bingham
thought
bingham
so
seldom
told
it
all
there
were
matters
in
the
back
of
bingham
s
mind
that
prompted
him
to
urge
the
course
that
cruickshank
had
been
empowered
by
the
opposing
counsel
to
suggest
party
considerations
that
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
talk
over
with
murchison
bingham
put
it
darkly
when
he
said
he
had
quite
as
much
hay
on
his
fork
as
he
cared
to
tackle
already
implying
that
the
defence
of
indiscretions
in
moneida
was
quite
an
unnecessary
addition
contingencies
seemed
probable
arising
out
of
the
moneida
charges
that
might
affect
the
central
organization
of
the
party
in
south
fox
to
an
extent
wholly
out
of
proportion
with
the
mere
necessity
of
a
second
election
bingham
talked
it
over
with
horace
williams
and
both
of
them
with
farquharson
they
were
all
there
to
urge
the
desirability
of
sawing
off
upon
lorne
when
he
found
them
at
headquarters
their
most
potent
argument
was
of
course
the
squire
and
the
immediate
dismissal
that
awaited
him
under
the
law
if
undue
influence
were
proved
against
him
other
considerations
found
the
newly
elected
member
for
south
fox
obstinate
and
troublesome
but
to
that
he
was
bound
to
listen
and
before
that
he
finally
withdrew
his
objections
the
election
would
come
on
again
as
happened
commonly
enough
bingham
could
point
to
the
opening
in
a
few
days
of
a
big
industry
across
the
river
which
would
help
operations
on
the
drill
hall
and
the
would
be
hurried
on
at
once
and
the
local
party
organization
would
be
thoroughly
overhauled
bingham
had
good
reason
for
believing
that
they
could
entirely
regain
their
lost
ground
and
at
the
same
time
dissipate
the
dangerous
impression
that
south
fox
was
being
undermined
their
candidate
gave
a
reluctant
ear
to
it
all
and
in
the
end
agreed
to
everything
so
that
chief
joseph
fry
the
white
clam
shell
of
his
own
lost
fires
was
never
allowed
the
chance
of
making
good
the
election
losses
of
that
year
as
he
had
confidently
expected
to
do
when
the
charge
came
on
nor
was
it
given
to
any
of
the
yellow
dogs
and
red
feathers
of
mr
cruickshank
s
citation
to
boast
at
the
tribal
of
the
future
of
the
occasion
on
which
they
had
bested
de
neither
was
any
further
part
in
public
affairs
except
by
way
of
jocular
reference
assigned
to
finnigan
s
cat
the
proceedings
of
the
court
abruptly
terminated
the
judges
reported
the
desirability
of
a
second
contest
and
the
public
accepted
with
a
wink
the
wink
in
any
form
was
hateful
to
lorne
murchison
but
he
had
not
to
encounter
it
long
the
young
man
had
changed
in
none
of
the
aspects
he
presented
to
his
since
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
in
the
public
eye
he
wore
the
same
virtues
as
he
wore
the
same
clothes
he
summed
up
even
a
greater
measure
of
success
his
popularity
was
unimpaired
he
went
as
keenly
about
the
business
of
life
handling
its
details
with
the
same
capable
old
drawl
only
his
mother
with
the
divination
of
mothers
declared
that
since
the
night
of
the
opera
house
meeting
lorne
had
been
all
worked
she
watched
him
with
furtive
anxious
looks
was
solicitous
about
his
food
expressed
relief
when
she
knew
him
to
be
safely
in
bed
and
asleep
he
himself
observed
himself
with
discontent
unable
to
fathom
his
extraordinary
lapse
from
on
the
night
of
his
final
address
he
charged
it
to
the
strain
of
unavoidable
office
work
on
top
of
the
business
of
the
campaign
abused
his
nerves
talked
of
a
few
days
rest
when
they
had
settled
winter
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
points
he
had
forgotten
when
he
had
his
great
chance
the
flag
should
have
come
in
at
the
end
he
would
say
to
himself
trying
vainly
to
remember
where
it
did
come
in
he
was
ill
pleased
with
the
issue
of
that
occasion
and
it
was
small
compensation
to
be
told
by
stella
that
his
speech
gave
her
shivers
up
and
down
her
back
meanwhile
the
theory
of
empire
coursed
in
his
blood
fed
by
the
revelation
of
the
future
of
his
country
in
every
newspaper
by
the
calculated
prophecies
of
american
onlookers
and
by
the
telegrams
which
repeated
the
trumpet
notes
of
wallingham
s
war
upon
the
mandarinate
of
great
britain
it
occupied
him
so
that
he
began
to
measure
and
limit
what
he
had
to
say
about
it
and
to
probe
the
casual
eye
for
sympathy
before
he
would
give
an
inch
of
rope
to
his
enthusiasm
he
found
it
as
hard
as
ever
to
understand
that
the
public
interest
should
be
otherwise
preoccupied
as
it
plainly
was
that
the
party
organ
terrified
of
quebec
should
shuffle
away
from
the
subject
with
perfunctory
and
noncommittal
reference
that
among
the
men
he
met
in
the
street
nobody
s
blood
seemed
stirred
whatever
the
day
s
news
was
from
england
he
subscribed
to
the
toronto
post
the
leading
organ
of
the
tories
because
of
its
fuller
reports
and
more
sympathetic
treatment
of
the
idea
due
to
the
fact
that
the
idea
originated
in
a
brain
temporarily
affiliated
to
the
conservative
party
if
the
departure
to
imperial
preference
had
any
damage
in
it
for
canadian
interests
it
would
be
for
those
which
the
post
made
its
special
care
but
the
spirit
of
party
draws
the
breath
of
expediency
and
the
post
flaunting
the
union
jack
every
other
day
put
secondary
manufactures
aside
for
future
discussion
and
tickled
the
with
the
advantage
they
were
coming
into
at
the
hands
of
the
english
conservatives
until
liberal
leaders
began
to
be
a
little
anxious
about
a
possible
loss
of
votes
it
was
as
john
murchison
said
a
queer
position
for
everybody
concerned
queer
enough
no
doubt
to
admit
a
tory
journal
into
the
house
on
sufferance
and
as
a
special
matter
but
he
had
a
disapproving
look
for
it
as
it
lay
on
the
hall
floor
and
seldom
was
the
first
to
open
it
nevertheless
lorne
found
more
satisfaction
in
talking
imperialism
with
his
father
than
with
anyone
else
while
the
practical
half
of
john
murchison
was
characteristically
alive
to
the
difficulties
involved
the
sentimental
half
of
him
was
ready
at
any
time
to
give
out
cautious
sparks
of
sympathy
with
the
splendour
of
wallingham
s
scheme
and
he
liked
the
feeling
that
a
son
of
his
should
hark
back
in
his
allegiance
to
the
old
land
there
was
a
kind
of
chivalry
in
the
placing
of
certain
forms
of
beauty
political
honour
and
public
devotion
which
blossomed
best
it
seemed
over
there
above
the
material
ease
and
margin
of
the
new
country
and
even
above
the
grand
chance
it
offered
for
a
man
to
make
his
mark
mr
murchison
was
susceptible
to
this
in
anyone
and
responsive
to
it
in
his
son
as
to
the
local
party
leaders
they
had
little
more
than
a
shrug
for
the
subject
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
there
was
no
empire
and
no
idea
wallingham
might
as
well
not
have
been
born
it
seemed
to
lorne
that
they
maintained
toward
him
personally
a
special
reticence
about
it
reticence
indeed
characterized
their
behaviour
generally
during
the
period
between
the
abandonment
of
the
suits
and
the
arrangement
of
the
second
liberal
convention
they
had
little
advice
for
him
about
his
political
attitude
little
advice
about
anything
he
noticed
that
his
presence
on
one
or
two
occasions
seemed
to
embarrass
them
and
that
his
arrival
would
sometimes
have
a
disintegrating
effect
upon
a
group
in
the
or
at
a
street
corner
he
added
it
without
thinking
to
his
general
heaviness
they
held
it
a
good
deal
against
him
he
supposed
to
have
reduced
their
proud
standing
majority
to
a
beggarly
two
figures
he
didn
t
blame
them
i
can
not
think
that
the
sum
of
these
depressions
alone
would
have
been
enough
to
overshadow
so
buoyant
a
soul
as
lorne
murchison
s
the
characteristics
of
him
i
have
tried
to
convey
were
grafted
on
an
excellent
fund
of
common
sense
he
was
well
aware
of
the
proportions
of
things
he
had
no
despair
of
the
idea
nor
would
he
despair
should
the
idea
etherealize
and
fly
away
neither
had
he
for
his
personal
honour
any
morbid
desires
toward
white
clam
shell
or
finnigan
s
cat
his
luck
had
been
a
good
deal
better
than
it
might
have
been
he
recognized
that
as
fully
as
any
sensible
young
man
could
and
as
for
the
great
chance
and
the
queer
grip
it
had
on
him
he
would
have
argued
that
too
if
anyone
had
approached
him
curiously
about
it
there
i
think
we
might
doubt
his
conclusions
there
is
nothing
subtler
more
elusive
to
trace
than
the
intercurrents
of
the
emotions
politics
and
love
are
thought
of
at
opposite
poles
and
wallingham
perhaps
would
have
laughed
to
know
that
he
owed
an
exalted
allegiance
in
part
to
a
heart
yet
the
impulse
that
is
beyond
our
calculation
the
thing
we
know
potential
in
the
blood
but
not
to
be
summoned
or
conditioned
lies
always
in
the
shadow
of
the
ideal
and
who
can
analyse
that
and
say
of
this
class
is
the
will
to
believe
in
the
integrity
of
the
beloved
and
false
of
that
is
the
desire
to
lift
a
nation
to
the
level
of
its
both
dispositions
have
a
tendency
to
overwork
the
heart
and
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
they
might
interact
lorne
murchison
s
wish
which
was
indeed
a
burning
longing
and
necessity
to
believe
in
the
dora
milburn
of
his
passion
had
been
under
a
strain
since
the
night
on
which
he
brought
her
the
pledge
which
she
refused
to
wear
he
had
hardly
been
conscious
of
it
in
the
beginning
but
by
constant
suggestion
it
had
grown
into
his
knowledge
and
for
weeks
he
had
taken
poignant
account
of
it
his
election
had
brought
him
no
nearer
a
settlement
with
her
objection
to
letting
the
world
know
of
their
relations
the
immediate
announcement
that
it
was
to
be
disputed
gave
dora
another
chance
and
once
again
postponed
the
assurance
that
he
longed
for
with
a
fever
which
was
his
own
condemnation
of
her
if
he
could
have
read
that
sign
for
months
he
had
seen
so
little
of
her
had
so
altered
his
constant
habit
of
going
to
the
milburns
that
his
family
talked
of
it
wondering
among
themselves
and
stella
indulged
in
hopeful
speculations
they
did
not
wonder
or
speculate
at
the
milburns
it
was
an
axiom
there
that
it
is
well
to
do
nothing
rashly
lorne
in
the
office
on
market
street
had
been
replying
to
mr
fulke
to
the
effect
that
the
convention
could
hardly
be
much
longer
postponed
but
that
as
yet
he
had
no
word
of
the
date
of
it
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
mr
farquharson
s
voice
at
the
other
end
asked
him
to
come
over
to
the
committee
room
they
ve
decided
about
it
now
i
imagine
he
told
his
senior
putting
on
his
hat
and
something
of
the
wonted
fighting
elation
came
upon
him
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
was
right
in
his
supposition
they
had
decided
about
it
and
they
were
waiting
in
a
group
that
made
every
effort
to
look
casual
to
tell
him
when
he
arrived
they
had
delegated
what
horace
williams
called
the
job
to
mr
farquharson
and
he
was
actually
struggling
with
the
preliminaries
of
it
when
bingham
uncomfortable
under
the
curious
quietude
of
the
young
fellow
s
attention
burst
out
with
the
whole
thing
the
fact
is
murchison
you
can
t
poll
the
vote
there
s
no
man
in
the
riding
we
d
be
better
pleased
to
send
to
the
house
but
we
ve
got
to
win
this
election
and
we
can
t
win
it
with
you
think
you
can
t
said
lorne
you
see
old
man
horace
williams
put
in
you
didn
t
get
rid
of
that
scheme
of
yours
soon
enough
people
got
to
think
you
meant
something
by
i
shall
never
get
rid
of
it
lorne
returned
simply
and
the
others
looked
at
one
another
the
popular
idea
seems
to
be
said
mr
farquharson
judicially
that
you
would
not
hesitate
to
put
canada
to
some
material
loss
or
at
least
to
postpone
her
development
in
various
important
directions
for
the
sake
of
the
imperial
wasn
t
that
lorne
asked
him
what
six
months
ago
you
were
all
prepared
to
do
oh
no
said
bingham
with
the
air
of
repudiating
for
everybody
concerned
not
for
a
cent
we
were
willing
at
one
time
to
work
it
for
what
is
was
worth
but
it
never
was
worth
that
and
if
you
d
had
a
little
more
experience
murchison
you
d
have
realized
that
s
right
lorne
contributed
horace
williams
experience
that
s
all
you
want
you
ve
got
everything
else
and
a
darned
sight
more
we
ll
get
you
there
all
in
good
time
but
this
time
you
want
me
to
step
down
and
out
said
lorne
that
s
for
you
to
say
bingham
told
him
we
can
nominate
you
again
all
right
but
we
re
afraid
we
can
t
get
you
the
convention
young
and
windle
have
been
working
like
moles
for
the
past
ten
days
for
carter
interrupted
lorne
carter
of
they
nodded
carter
stood
the
admitted
fact
i
m
sorry
it
s
carter
said
lorne
thoughtfully
however
and
he
dropped
staring
before
him
into
silence
the
others
eyed
him
from
serious
underhung
faces
horace
williams
with
an
obvious
effort
got
up
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
brace
up
old
chap
he
said
you
made
a
blame
good
fight
for
us
and
we
ll
do
the
same
for
you
another
however
gentlemen
the
young
man
gathered
himself
up
to
say
i
believe
i
understand
the
situation
you
are
my
friends
and
this
is
your
advice
we
must
save
the
seat
i
ll
see
carter
if
i
can
get
anything
out
of
him
to
make
me
think
he
ll
go
straight
on
the
scheme
to
save
the
empire
he
smiled
faintly
when
it
comes
to
a
vote
i
ll
withdraw
in
his
favour
at
the
convention
horace
here
will
think
up
something
for
me
any
old
lie
will
do
i
suppose
in
any
case
of
course
i
he
took
his
hat
and
they
all
got
up
startled
a
little
at
the
quick
and
simple
close
of
the
difficult
scene
they
had
anticipated
horace
williams
offered
his
hand
shake
lorne
he
said
and
the
other
two
coming
nearer
followed
his
example
why
yes
said
lorne
he
left
them
with
a
brief
excuse
and
they
stood
together
in
a
moment
s
silence
three
practical
politicians
who
had
delivered
themselves
from
a
dangerous
network
involving
higher
things
dash
these
talks
said
bingham
irritably
it
s
the
only
thing
to
do
but
why
the
devil
didn
t
he
want
something
out
of
it
i
had
that
registrarship
in
my
inside
if
anybody
likes
to
kick
me
round
the
room
remarked
horace
williams
with
depression
i
have
no
very
strong
and
now
mr
farquharson
said
with
a
sigh
we
understand
it
s
got
to
be
carter
i
suppose
i
m
too
old
a
man
to
do
jockey
for
a
but
i
own
i
ve
enjoyed
the
lorne
murchison
went
out
into
the
companionship
of
main
street
the
new
check
in
his
fortunes
hanging
before
him
we
may
imagine
that
it
hung
heavily
we
may
suppose
that
it
cut
off
the
view
as
bingham
would
have
said
he
was
up
against
it
and
that
when
one
is
confidently
treading
the
straight
path
to
accomplishment
is
a
dazing
experience
he
was
up
against
it
yet
already
he
had
recoiled
far
enough
to
consider
it
already
he
was
adapting
his
heart
his
nerves
and
his
future
to
it
his
heart
took
it
greatly
told
him
he
had
not
yet
force
enough
for
the
business
he
had
aspired
to
but
gave
him
a
secret
assurance
another
time
he
would
find
more
strength
and
show
more
cunning
he
would
not
disdain
the
tools
of
diplomacy
and
desirability
he
would
dream
no
more
of
short
cuts
in
great
political
departures
his
heart
bowed
to
its
sorry
education
and
took
counsel
with
him
bidding
him
be
of
good
courage
and
push
on
he
was
up
against
it
but
he
would
get
round
it
and
there
on
the
other
side
lay
the
same
wide
prospect
with
the
idea
shining
high
at
one
point
he
faltered
but
that
was
a
matter
of
expediency
rather
than
of
courage
he
searched
and
selected
as
he
went
along
the
street
among
phrases
that
would
convey
his
disaster
to
dora
milburn
just
at
that
point
the
turning
to
his
own
office
he
felt
it
hard
luck
that
alfred
hesketh
should
meet
and
want
a
word
with
him
hesketh
had
become
tolerable
only
when
other
things
were
equal
lorne
had
not
seen
him
since
the
night
of
his
election
when
his
felicitations
had
seemed
to
stand
for
very
little
one
way
or
another
his
manner
now
was
more
important
charged
with
other
considerations
lorne
waited
on
the
word
uncomfortably
putting
off
the
necessity
of
coming
out
with
his
misfortune
i
haven
t
come
across
you
murchison
but
you
ve
had
my
sympathy
i
needn
t
say
all
this
time
a
man
can
t
go
into
politics
with
gloves
on
there
s
no
doubt
about
that
though
mind
you
i
never
for
a
moment
believed
that
you
let
yourself
in
personally
i
mean
i
ve
held
you
all
through
above
the
faintest
have
you
said
lorne
well
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
oh
i
have
i
assure
you
but
give
me
a
disputed
election
for
the
revelation
of
a
rotten
state
of
things
eh
it
does
show
up
pretty
low
doesn
t
it
however
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
any
better
in
england
at
bottom
we
ve
got
a
lower
class
to
deal
with
you
know
i
m
beginning
to
have
a
great
respect
for
the
electorate
of
this
country
murchison
not
necessarily
the
methods
but
the
rank
and
file
of
the
people
they
know
what
they
want
and
they
re
going
to
have
yes
said
lorne
i
guess
they
and
that
brings
me
to
my
news
old
man
i
ve
given
the
matter
a
lot
of
time
and
a
lot
of
consideration
and
i
ve
decided
that
i
can
t
do
better
than
drive
in
a
stake
for
myself
in
this
new
country
of
it
isn
t
so
very
new
lorne
told
him
in
rather
dull
response
but
i
expect
that
s
a
pretty
good
line
to
take
why
yes
first
as
to
the
line
hesketh
went
on
weightily
leading
the
way
through
an
encumbering
group
of
farmers
at
a
corner
i
ve
selected
that
too
milburn
has
never
built
them
yet
but
he
says
the
opportunity
is
ripe
milburn
lorne
wheeled
sharply
my
future
partner
he
was
planning
extensions
just
as
i
came
along
a
fortunate
moment
i
hope
it
will
prove
for
us
both
i
d
like
to
go
into
it
with
you
some
time
when
you
have
leisure
it
s
a
scheme
of
extraordinary
promise
by
the
way
there
s
an
idea
in
it
that
ought
to
appeal
to
you
driving
the
force
that
s
to
subdue
this
wilderness
of
when
you
ve
lived
here
for
a
while
said
lorne
painfully
preoccupied
you
ll
think
it
quite
civilized
so
you
re
going
in
with
milburn
oh
i
m
proud
of
it
already
i
shall
make
a
good
canadian
i
trust
and
as
good
an
imperialist
he
added
as
is
consistent
with
the
claims
of
my
adopted
that
seems
to
be
the
popular
view
said
lorne
and
a
very
reasonable
view
too
but
i
m
not
going
to
embark
on
that
with
you
old
fellow
you
shan
t
draw
me
in
i
know
where
you
are
on
that
so
do
i
i
m
stranded
but
it
s
all
right
the
subject
isn
t
lorne
said
quietly
and
hesketh
s
exclamations
and
inquiries
brought
out
the
morning
s
reverse
the
young
englishman
was
cordially
sorry
full
of
concern
and
personal
disappointment
abandoning
his
own
absorbing
affairs
and
devoting
his
whole
attention
to
the
unfortunate
exigency
which
lorne
dragged
out
of
his
breast
in
pure
manfulness
to
lay
before
him
however
they
came
to
the
end
of
it
arriving
at
the
same
time
at
the
door
which
led
up
the
stairs
to
the
office
of
fulke
warner
and
murchison
thank
you
said
lorne
thank
you
oh
i
dare
say
it
will
come
all
right
in
the
course
of
time
you
return
to
england
i
suppose
or
do
you
before
you
go
in
with
milburn
i
sail
next
week
said
hesketh
and
a
great
relief
shot
into
the
face
of
his
companion
i
have
a
good
deal
to
see
to
over
there
i
shan
t
get
back
much
before
june
i
fancy
and
i
must
tell
you
i
am
doing
the
thing
very
thoroughly
this
business
of
naturalizing
myself
i
mean
i
am
going
to
marry
that
very
charming
girl
a
great
friend
of
yours
by
the
way
i
know
her
to
be
miss
for
accepting
the
strokes
of
fate
we
have
curiously
trivial
demonstrations
lorne
met
hesketh
s
eye
with
the
steadiness
of
a
lion
s
in
his
own
the
unusual
thing
he
did
was
to
take
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
and
let
his
arms
hang
loosely
by
his
side
it
was
as
tragic
a
gesture
of
helplessness
as
if
he
had
flung
them
above
his
head
dora
is
going
to
marry
you
i
believe
she
will
do
me
that
honour
and
i
consider
it
an
honour
miss
milburn
will
compare
with
any
english
girl
i
ever
met
but
i
half
expected
you
to
congratulate
me
i
know
she
wrote
to
you
this
morning
you
were
one
of
the
i
shall
probably
find
the
letter
said
lorne
mechanically
when
i
go
he
still
eyed
hesketh
narrowly
as
if
he
had
somewhere
concealed
about
him
the
explanation
of
this
final
bitter
circumstance
he
had
a
desire
not
to
leave
him
to
stand
and
parley
to
go
upstairs
to
the
office
would
be
to
plunge
into
the
gulf
he
held
back
from
that
and
leaned
against
the
door
frame
crossing
his
arms
and
looking
over
into
the
for
subjects
to
postpone
hesketh
s
departure
they
talked
of
various
matters
in
sight
hesketh
showing
the
zest
of
his
newly
determined
citizenship
in
every
observation
the
extension
of
the
electric
tramway
the
pulling
down
of
the
old
fire
hall
in
one
consciousness
lorne
made
concise
and
relevant
remarks
in
another
he
sat
in
a
spinning
dark
world
and
waited
for
the
crash
it
seemed
to
come
when
hesketh
said
preparing
to
go
i
ll
tell
miss
milburn
i
saw
you
i
suppose
this
change
in
your
political
prospects
won
t
affect
your
professional
plans
in
any
way
you
ll
stick
on
here
at
the
bar
it
was
the
very
shock
of
calamity
and
for
the
instant
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
night
of
it
but
one
far
avenue
of
escape
a
possibility
he
had
never
thought
of
seriously
until
that
moment
the
conception
seemed
to
form
itself
on
his
lips
to
be
involuntary
i
don
t
know
a
college
friend
has
been
pressing
me
for
some
time
to
join
him
in
milwaukee
he
offers
me
plenty
of
work
and
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
closing
with
go
over
to
the
united
states
you
can
t
mean
that
oh
yes
it
s
the
next
best
thing
hesketh
s
face
assumed
a
gravity
a
look
of
feeling
and
of
remonstrance
he
came
a
step
nearer
and
put
a
hand
on
his
companion
s
arm
come
now
murchison
he
said
i
ask
you
is
this
a
time
to
be
thinking
of
chucking
the
empire
lorne
moved
farther
into
the
passage
with
an
abruptness
which
left
his
interlocutor
staring
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
turned
to
mount
the
stair
with
a
reply
which
a
passing
dray
happily
prevented
from
reaching
hesketh
s
ears
no
damn
you
he
said
it
s
not
i
can
not
let
him
finish
on
that
uncontrolled
phrase
though
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
his
provocation
was
great
nor
must
we
leave
him
in
heavy
captivity
to
the
thought
of
oblivion
in
the
unregarding
welter
of
the
near
republic
of
plunging
into
more
strenuous
activities
and
abandoning
his
ideal
in
queer
inverted
analogy
to
the
refuging
of
weak
women
in
a
convent
we
know
that
his
ideal
was
strong
enough
to
reassert
itself
under
a
keen
irony
of
suggestion
in
the
very
depth
of
his
overwhelming
and
the
thing
that
could
rise
in
him
at
that
black
moment
may
be
trusted
perhaps
to
reclaim
his
fortitude
and
reconsecrate
his
energy
when
these
things
come
again
into
the
full
current
of
his
life
the
illness
that
after
two
or
three
lagging
days
brought
him
its
merciful
physical
distraction
was
laid
in
the
general
understanding
at
the
door
of
his
political
disappointment
and
among
a
crowd
of
sympathizers
confined
to
no
party
horace
williams
as
his
wife
expressed
it
was
pretty
nearly
wild
during
its
progress
the
power
of
the
press
is
regrettably
small
in
such
emergencies
but
what
restoration
it
had
horace
anxiously
administered
the
express
published
a
daily
bulletin
the
second
election
passed
only
by
the
murchison
family
carter
very
nearly
the
liberal
majority
the
dominion
dwelt
upon
this
repeated
demonstration
of
the
strength
of
reform
principles
in
south
fox
and
mrs
murchison
said
they
were
welcome
to
carter
many
will
sympathize
with
mrs
murchison
at
this
point
i
hope
and
regret
to
abandon
her
in
such
equivocal
approval
of
the
circumstances
which
have
arisen
round
her
too
anxiously
occupied
at
home
to
take
her
share
in
the
general
pleasant
sensation
of
dr
drummond
s
marriage
she
was
compelled
to
give
it
a
hurried
consideration
and
a
sanction
which
was
practically
wrested
from
her
she
could
not
be
clear
as
to
the
course
of
events
that
led
to
it
nor
entirely
satisfied
as
she
said
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
affair
this
although
she
felt
she
could
be
clearer
and
possibly
had
better
grounds
for
being
satisfied
than
other
people
as
to
advena
s
simple
statement
that
miss
cameron
had
made
a
second
choice
of
the
doctor
changing
her
mind
as
far
as
mrs
murchison
could
see
without
rhyme
or
reason
that
mrs
murchison
took
leave
to
find
a
very
poor
explanation
advena
s
own
behaviour
toward
the
rejection
is
one
of
the
things
which
her
mother
declares
probably
truly
that
she
never
will
understand
to
pick
up
a
man
in
the
actual
fling
of
being
thrown
over
will
never
in
mrs
murchison
s
eyes
constitute
a
decorous
proceeding
i
suppose
she
thinks
the
creature
might
have
been
made
to
wait
at
least
until
he
had
found
his
feet
she
professes
to
cherish
no
antagonism
to
her
future
on
this
account
although
as
she
says
it
s
a
queer
way
to
come
into
a
family
and
she
makes
no
secret
of
her
belief
that
miss
cameron
showed
excellent
judgement
in
doing
as
she
did
however
that
woman
came
to
have
the
opportunity
hesketh
had
sailed
before
lorne
left
his
room
to
return
in
june
to
those
privileges
and
prospects
of
citizenship
which
he
so
eminently
deserves
to
enjoy
when
her
brother
s
convalescence
and
departure
for
florida
had
untied
her
tongue
stella
widely
proclaimed
her
opinion
that
mr
hesketh
s
engagement
to
miss
milburn
was
the
most
suitable
thing
that
could
be
imagined
or
desired
we
know
the
youngest
miss
murchison
to
be
inclined
to
impulsive
views
but
it
would
be
safe
i
think
to
follow
her
here
now
that
the
question
no
longer
circles
in
the
actual
vortex
of
elgin
politics
mr
octavius
milburn
s
attitude
toward
the
conditions
of
imperial
connection
has
become
almost
as
mellow
as
ever
circumstances
may
arise
any
day
however
to
stir
up
that
latent
bitterness
which
is
so
potential
in
him
and
then
i
fear
there
will
be
no
restraining
him
from
again
attacking
wallingham
in
the
papers
henry
cruickshank
growing
old
in
his
eminence
and
less
secure
perhaps
in
the
increasing
conflict
of
loud
voices
of
his
own
grasp
of
the
ultimate
best
fearing
too
no
doubt
the
approach
of
that
cynicism
which
moral
or
immoral
is
the
real
hoar
of
age
wrote
to
young
murchison
while
he
was
still
examining
the
problems
of
the
united
states
with
the
of
the
alien
and
offered
him
a
partnership
the
terms
were
so
simple
and
advantageous
as
only
to
be
explicable
on
the
grounds
i
have
mentioned
though
no
phrase
suggested
them
in
the
brief
formulas
of
the
letter
in
which
one
is
tempted
to
find
the
individual
parallel
of
certain
propositions
of
a
great
government
also
growing
old
the
offer
was
accepted
not
without
emotion
and
there
too
it
would
be
good
to
trace
the
parallel
were
we
permitted
but
for
that
it
is
too
soon
or
perhaps
it
is
too
late
here
for
lorne
and
for
his
country
we
lose
the
thread
of
destiny
the
shuttles
fly
weaving
the
will
of
the
nations
with
a
skein
for
ever
dipped
again
and
he
goes
forth
to
his
share
in
the
task
among
those
by
whose
hand
and
direction
the
pattern
and
the
colours
will
be
made
end
