subject
of
theme
an
interesting
incident
of
my
christmas
holadays
introduction
a
tyrant
power
in
rigor
is
dryden
i
have
decided
to
relate
with
precision
what
occurred
during
my
recent
christmas
holiday
although
i
was
away
from
this
school
only
four
days
returning
unexpectedly
the
day
after
christmas
a
number
of
incidents
occurred
which
i
believe
i
should
narrate
it
is
only
just
and
fair
that
the
upper
house
at
least
should
know
of
the
injustice
of
my
exile
and
that
it
is
all
the
result
of
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
for
i
make
this
appeal
and
with
good
reason
is
it
any
fault
of
mine
that
my
sister
leila
is
months
older
than
i
am
naturally
no
is
it
fair
also
i
ask
that
in
the
best
society
a
girl
is
a
the
year
before
she
comes
out
and
although
mature
in
mind
and
even
maturer
in
many
ways
than
her
older
sister
the
latter
is
treated
as
a
young
lady
enjoying
many
privileges
while
the
former
is
treated
as
a
mere
child
in
spite
as
i
have
observed
of
only
months
difference
i
wish
to
place
myself
on
record
that
it
is
not
fair
i
shall
go
back
for
a
short
time
to
the
way
things
were
at
home
when
i
was
small
i
was
very
strictly
raised
with
the
exception
of
tommy
gray
who
lives
next
door
and
only
is
about
my
age
i
was
never
permitted
to
know
any
of
the
other
sex
looking
back
i
am
sure
that
the
present
way
society
is
organized
is
really
to
blame
for
everything
i
am
being
frank
and
that
is
the
way
i
feel
i
was
too
strictly
raised
i
always
had
a
governess
tagging
along
until
i
came
here
to
school
i
had
never
walked
to
the
corner
of
the
next
street
unattended
if
it
was
mademoiselle
it
was
mother
maid
and
if
it
was
either
of
them
it
was
mother
herself
telling
me
to
hold
my
toes
out
and
my
shoulder
blades
in
as
i
have
said
i
never
knew
any
of
the
other
sex
except
the
miserable
little
beasts
at
dancing
school
i
used
to
make
faces
at
them
when
mademoiselle
was
putting
on
my
slippers
and
pulling
out
my
hair
bow
they
were
totally
uninteresting
and
i
used
to
put
pins
in
my
sash
so
that
they
would
get
scratched
their
pumps
mostly
squeaked
and
nobody
noticed
it
although
i
have
known
my
parents
to
dismiss
a
butler
who
creaked
at
the
table
when
i
was
sent
away
to
school
i
expected
to
learn
something
of
life
but
i
was
disappointed
i
do
not
desire
to
criticize
this
institution
of
learning
it
is
an
excellent
one
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
best
families
send
their
daughters
here
but
to
learn
life
one
must
know
something
of
both
sides
of
it
male
and
female
it
was
therefore
a
matter
of
deep
regret
to
me
to
find
that
with
the
exception
of
the
dancing
master
who
has
three
children
and
the
gardener
there
were
no
members
of
the
sterner
sex
to
be
seen
the
athletic
coach
was
a
girl
as
she
has
left
now
to
be
married
i
venture
to
say
that
she
was
not
what
lord
chesterfield
so
euphoniously
termed
suaviter
in
modo
fortater
in
re
when
we
go
out
to
walk
we
are
taken
to
the
country
and
the
three
matinees
a
year
we
see
in
the
city
are
mostly
shakespeare
arranged
for
the
young
we
are
allowed
only
certain
magazines
the
atlantic
monthly
and
one
or
two
others
and
barbara
armstrong
was
penalized
for
having
a
framed
photograph
of
her
brother
in
running
clothes
at
the
school
dances
we
are
compelled
to
dance
with
each
other
and
the
result
is
that
when
at
home
at
holiday
parties
i
always
try
to
lead
which
annoys
the
boys
i
dance
with
notwithstanding
all
this
it
is
an
excellent
school
we
learn
a
great
deal
and
our
dear
principal
is
a
most
charming
and
erudite
person
but
we
see
very
little
of
life
and
if
school
is
a
preparation
for
life
where
are
we
being
here
alone
since
the
day
after
christmas
i
have
had
time
to
think
everything
out
i
am
naturally
a
thinking
person
and
now
i
am
no
longer
indignant
i
realize
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
i
am
only
paying
the
penalty
that
i
deserve
although
i
consider
it
most
unfair
to
be
given
french
translation
to
do
i
do
not
object
to
going
to
bed
at
nine
although
ten
is
the
hour
in
the
upper
house
because
i
have
time
then
to
look
back
over
things
and
to
reflect
to
think
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
shakespeare
body
of
theme
i
now
approach
the
narrative
of
what
happened
during
the
first
four
days
of
my
christmas
holiday
for
a
period
before
the
fifteenth
of
december
i
was
rather
worried
all
the
girls
in
the
school
were
getting
new
clothes
for
christmas
parties
and
their
families
were
sending
on
invitations
in
great
numbers
to
various
festivities
that
were
to
occur
when
they
went
home
nothing
however
had
come
for
me
and
i
was
worried
but
on
the
mother
visiting
secretary
sent
on
four
that
i
was
to
accept
with
tiped
acceptances
for
me
to
copy
and
send
she
also
sent
me
the
good
news
that
i
was
to
have
two
party
dresses
and
i
was
to
send
on
my
measurements
for
them
one
of
the
parties
was
a
dinner
and
theater
party
to
be
given
by
carter
brooks
on
new
year
day
carter
brooks
is
the
yale
center
although
now
no
longer
such
but
selling
advertizing
ecetera
it
is
tragic
to
think
that
after
having
so
long
anticipated
that
party
i
am
now
here
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
which
is
a
figure
of
speech
for
the
peter
thompson
uniform
of
the
school
with
plain
white
for
evenings
and
no
jewelry
it
was
with
anticipatory
joy
therefore
that
i
sent
the
acceptances
and
the
desired
measurements
and
sat
down
to
cheerfully
while
away
the
time
in
studies
and
the
various
duties
of
school
life
until
the
holidays
however
i
was
not
long
to
rest
in
piece
for
in
a
few
days
i
received
a
letter
from
carter
brooks
as
follows
dear
barbara
it
was
sweet
of
you
to
write
me
so
promptly
although
i
confess
to
being
rather
astonished
as
well
as
delighted
at
being
called
dearest
the
signature
too
was
charming
ever
thine
but
dear
child
wo
you
write
at
once
and
tell
me
why
the
waist
bust
and
hip
measurements
and
the
request
to
have
them
really
low
in
the
neck
ever
thine
carter
it
will
be
perceived
that
i
had
sent
him
the
letter
to
mother
by
mistake
i
was
very
unhappy
about
it
it
was
not
an
auspicious
way
to
begin
the
holidays
especially
the
low
neck
also
i
disliked
very
much
having
told
him
my
waist
measure
which
is
large
owing
to
basket
ball
as
i
have
stated
before
i
have
known
very
few
of
the
other
sex
but
some
of
the
girls
had
had
more
experience
and
in
the
days
before
we
went
home
we
talked
a
great
deal
about
things
especially
love
i
felt
that
it
was
rather
particularly
in
fiction
also
i
felt
and
observed
at
divers
times
that
i
would
never
marry
it
was
my
intention
to
go
upon
the
stage
although
modified
since
by
what
i
am
about
to
relate
the
other
girls
say
that
i
look
like
julia
marlowe
some
of
the
girls
had
boys
who
wrote
to
them
and
one
of
them
i
refrain
from
giving
her
name
had
a
code
you
read
every
third
word
he
called
her
cousin
and
he
would
write
like
this
dear
cousin
i
am
well
am
just
about
crazy
this
week
to
go
home
see
notice
enclosed
you
football
game
and
so
on
and
on
only
what
it
really
said
was
i
am
crazy
to
see
you
in
giving
this
code
i
am
betraying
no
secrets
as
they
have
quarreled
and
everything
is
now
over
between
them
as
i
had
nobody
at
that
time
and
as
i
had
visions
of
a
career
i
was
a
i
acknowledge
that
this
was
a
pose
but
after
all
what
is
life
but
a
pose
stupid
things
i
always
said
nothing
in
their
heads
but
football
and
tobacco
smoke
women
i
said
are
only
their
playthings
and
when
they
do
grow
up
and
get
a
little
intelligence
they
use
it
in
making
money
there
has
been
a
story
in
the
school
i
got
it
from
one
of
the
little
girls
that
i
was
disappointed
in
love
in
early
youth
the
object
of
my
attachment
having
been
the
tenor
in
our
church
choir
at
home
i
daresay
i
should
have
denied
the
soft
impeachment
but
i
did
not
it
was
although
not
appearing
so
at
the
time
my
first
downward
step
on
the
path
that
leads
to
destruction
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
bible
i
come
now
to
the
momentous
day
of
my
return
to
my
dear
home
for
christmas
father
and
my
sister
leila
who
from
now
on
i
will
term
sis
met
me
at
the
station
sis
was
very
elegantly
dressed
and
she
said
hello
kid
and
turned
her
cheek
for
me
to
kiss
she
is
as
i
have
stated
but
months
older
than
i
and
depends
altogether
on
her
clothes
for
her
beauty
in
the
morning
she
is
plain
although
having
a
good
skin
she
was
trimmed
up
with
a
bouquet
of
violets
as
large
as
a
dishpan
and
she
covered
them
with
her
hands
when
i
kissed
her
she
was
waved
and
powdered
and
she
had
on
a
perfectly
new
outfit
and
i
was
shabby
that
is
the
exact
word
shabby
if
you
have
to
hang
your
entire
wardrobe
in
a
closet
ten
inches
deep
and
put
it
over
you
on
cold
nights
with
the
steam
heat
shut
off
at
ten
it
does
not
make
it
look
any
better
my
father
has
always
been
my
favorite
member
of
the
family
and
he
was
very
glad
to
see
me
he
has
a
great
deal
of
tact
also
and
later
on
he
slipped
ten
dollars
in
my
purse
in
the
motor
i
needed
it
very
much
as
after
i
had
paid
the
porter
and
bought
luncheon
i
had
only
three
dollars
left
and
an
from
one
of
the
girls
for
cents
which
this
may
remind
her
if
it
is
read
in
class
she
has
forgotten
good
heavens
barbara
sis
said
while
i
hugged
father
you
certainly
need
to
be
pressed
i
daresay
i
be
the
better
for
a
hot
iron
i
retorted
but
at
least
i
sha
need
it
on
my
hair
my
hair
is
curly
while
hers
is
straight
boarding
school
wit
she
said
and
stocked
to
the
motor
mother
was
in
the
car
and
glad
to
see
me
but
as
usual
she
managed
to
restrain
her
enthusiasm
she
put
her
hands
over
some
orchids
she
was
wearing
when
i
kissed
her
she
and
sis
were
on
their
way
to
something
or
other
trimmed
up
like
easter
hats
you
two
i
said
school
has
not
changed
you
i
fear
barbara
mother
observed
i
hope
you
are
studying
hard
exactly
as
hard
as
i
have
to
no
more
no
less
i
regret
to
confess
that
i
replied
and
i
saw
sis
and
mother
exchange
glances
of
significance
we
dropped
them
at
the
reception
and
father
went
to
his
office
and
i
went
on
home
alone
and
all
at
once
i
began
to
be
embittered
sis
had
everything
and
what
had
i
and
when
i
got
home
and
saw
that
sis
had
had
her
room
done
over
and
ivory
toilet
things
on
her
dressing
table
and
two
perfectly
huge
boxes
of
candy
on
a
stand
and
a
ball
gown
laid
out
on
the
bed
i
almost
wept
my
own
room
was
just
as
i
had
left
it
it
had
been
the
night
nursery
and
there
was
still
the
dent
in
the
mantel
where
i
had
thrown
a
hair
brush
at
sis
and
the
ink
spot
on
the
carpet
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
everything
mademoiselle
had
gone
and
hannah
mother
maid
came
to
help
me
off
with
my
things
i
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
raged
they
still
thought
i
was
a
little
girl
they
patronized
me
i
would
hardly
have
been
surprised
if
they
had
sent
up
a
bread
and
milk
supper
on
a
tray
it
was
then
and
there
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
show
them
that
i
was
no
longer
a
mere
child
that
the
time
was
gone
when
they
could
shut
me
up
in
the
nursery
and
forget
me
i
was
seventeen
years
and
eleven
days
old
and
juliet
in
shakespeare
was
only
sixteen
when
she
had
her
affair
with
romeo
i
had
no
plan
then
it
was
not
until
the
next
afternoon
that
the
thing
sprung
sprang
fullblown
from
the
head
of
jove
the
evening
was
rather
dreary
the
family
was
going
out
but
not
until
nine
thirty
and
mother
and
leila
went
over
my
clothes
they
sat
sis
in
pink
chiffon
and
mother
in
black
and
silver
and
hannah
took
out
my
things
and
held
them
up
i
was
obliged
to
silently
sit
by
while
my
rags
and
misery
were
exposed
why
this
open
humiliation
i
demanded
at
last
i
am
the
family
cinderella
i
admit
it
but
it
is
necessary
to
lay
so
much
emphasis
on
it
is
it
do
be
sarcastic
barbara
said
mother
you
are
still
only
a
child
and
a
very
untidy
child
at
that
what
do
you
do
with
your
elbows
to
rub
them
through
so
it
must
have
taken
patience
and
application
mother
i
said
am
i
to
have
the
party
dresses
two
very
simple
low
in
the
neck
certainly
not
a
small
v
perhaps
i
got
a
good
neck
she
rose
impressively
you
amaze
and
shock
me
barbara
she
said
coldly
i
should
have
to
wear
tulle
around
my
shoulders
to
hide
the
bones
i
retorted
sis
is
rather
thin
you
are
a
very
little
girl
mother
said
looking
up
at
me
i
am
two
inches
taller
than
she
is
unless
you
learn
to
curb
yourself
there
will
be
no
parties
for
you
and
no
party
dresses
this
was
the
speech
that
broke
the
camel
back
i
could
endure
no
more
i
think
i
said
that
i
shall
get
married
and
end
everything
need
i
explain
that
i
had
no
serious
intention
of
taking
the
fatal
step
but
it
was
not
deliberate
mendacity
it
was
despair
mother
actually
went
white
she
clutched
me
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
what
are
you
saying
she
demanded
i
think
you
heard
me
mother
i
said
very
politely
i
was
however
thinking
hard
marry
whom
barbara
answer
me
i
do
know
anybody
she
trying
to
frighten
you
mother
sis
said
there
is
anybody
do
let
her
fool
you
oh
is
there
i
said
in
a
dark
and
portentous
manner
mother
gave
me
a
long
look
and
went
out
i
heard
her
go
into
but
sis
sat
on
my
bed
and
watched
me
who
is
it
bab
she
asked
the
dancing
teacher
or
your
riding
master
or
the
school
plumber
guess
again
you
just
enough
of
a
little
simpleton
to
get
tied
up
to
some
wretched
creature
and
disgrace
us
all
i
wish
to
state
here
that
until
that
moment
i
had
no
intention
of
going
any
further
with
the
miserable
business
i
am
naturally
truthful
and
deception
is
hateful
to
me
but
when
my
sister
uttered
the
above
disparaging
remark
i
saw
that
to
preserve
my
own
dignity
which
i
value
above
precious
stones
i
would
be
compelled
to
go
on
i
perfectly
mad
about
him
i
said
and
he
crazy
about
me
i
like
very
much
to
know
sis
said
as
she
stood
up
and
stared
at
me
how
much
you
are
making
up
and
how
much
is
true
none
the
less
i
saw
that
she
was
terrified
the
family
kitten
to
speak
in
allegory
had
become
a
lion
and
showed
its
claws
when
she
had
gone
out
i
tried
to
think
of
some
one
to
hang
a
love
affair
to
but
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
dancing
master
had
one
eye
and
three
children
and
that
the
clergyman
at
school
was
elderly
with
two
wives
one
dead
i
searched
my
past
but
it
was
blameless
it
was
empty
and
bare
and
as
i
looked
back
and
saw
how
little
there
had
been
in
it
but
imbibing
wisdom
and
playing
and
tennis
and
typhoid
fever
when
i
was
fourteen
and
almost
having
to
have
my
head
shaved
a
great
wave
of
bitterness
agitated
me
never
again
i
observed
to
myself
with
firmness
never
again
if
i
have
to
invent
a
member
of
the
other
sex
at
that
time
however
owing
to
the
appearance
of
hannah
with
a
mending
basket
i
got
no
further
than
his
name
it
was
harold
i
decided
to
have
him
dark
with
a
very
small
black
mustache
and
passionate
eyes
i
felt
too
that
he
would
be
jealous
the
eyes
would
be
of
the
smoldering
type
showing
the
monster
beneath
i
was
very
much
cheered
up
at
least
they
could
not
ignore
me
any
more
and
i
felt
that
they
would
see
the
point
if
i
was
old
enough
to
have
a
lover
especially
a
jealous
one
with
the
aforementioned
eyes
i
was
old
enough
to
have
the
necks
of
my
frocks
cut
out
while
they
were
getting
their
wraps
on
in
the
lower
hall
i
counted
my
money
i
had
thirteen
dollars
it
was
enough
for
a
plan
i
was
beginning
to
have
in
mind
go
to
bed
early
barbara
mother
said
when
they
were
ready
to
go
out
you
do
mind
if
i
write
a
letter
do
you
to
whom
oh
just
a
letter
i
said
and
she
stared
at
me
coldly
i
daresay
you
will
write
it
whether
i
consent
or
not
leave
it
on
the
hall
table
and
it
will
go
out
with
the
morning
mail
i
may
run
out
to
the
box
with
it
i
forbid
your
doing
anything
of
the
sort
oh
very
well
i
responded
meekly
if
there
is
such
haste
about
it
give
it
to
hannah
to
mail
very
well
i
said
she
made
an
excuse
to
see
hannah
before
she
left
and
i
knew
that
i
was
being
watched
i
was
greatly
excited
and
happier
than
i
had
been
for
weeks
but
when
i
had
settled
myself
in
the
library
with
the
paper
in
front
of
me
i
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
in
a
letter
so
i
wrote
a
poem
to
h
dear
love
you
seem
so
far
away
i
would
that
you
were
near
do
so
long
to
hear
you
say
love
you
dear
here
all
is
cold
and
drear
and
strange
with
none
who
with
me
tarry
hope
that
soon
we
can
arrange
to
run
away
and
marry
the
last
verse
did
not
scan
exactly
but
i
wished
to
use
the
word
marry
if
possible
it
would
show
i
felt
that
things
were
really
serious
and
impending
a
love
affair
is
only
a
love
affair
but
marriage
is
marriage
and
the
end
of
everything
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
strange
thing
occurred
which
did
not
seem
strange
at
all
at
the
time
but
which
developed
into
so
great
a
mystery
later
on
which
was
to
actually
threaten
my
reason
and
which
flying
on
winged
feet
was
to
send
me
back
here
to
school
the
day
after
christmas
and
put
my
seed
pearl
necklace
in
the
safe
deposit
vault
which
was
very
unfair
for
what
had
my
necklace
to
do
with
it
and
just
now
when
i
need
comfort
it
the
necklace
would
help
to
relieve
my
exile
hannah
brought
me
in
a
cup
of
hot
milk
with
a
valentine
malted
milk
tablet
dissolved
in
it
as
i
stirred
it
around
it
occurred
to
me
that
valentine
would
be
a
good
name
for
harold
on
the
spot
i
named
him
harold
valentine
and
i
wrote
the
name
on
the
envelope
that
had
the
poem
inside
and
addressed
it
to
the
town
where
this
school
gets
its
mail
it
looked
well
written
out
valentine
also
is
a
word
that
naturally
connects
itself
with
affairs
de
cour
and
i
felt
that
i
was
safe
for
as
there
was
no
harold
valentine
he
could
not
call
for
the
letter
at
the
post
office
and
would
therefore
not
be
able
to
cause
me
any
trouble
under
any
circumstances
and
furthermore
i
knew
that
hannah
would
not
mail
the
letter
anyhow
but
would
give
it
to
mother
so
even
if
there
was
a
harold
valentine
he
would
never
get
it
comforted
by
these
reflections
i
drank
my
malted
milk
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
destiny
which
never
swerves
nor
yields
to
men
the
helm
emerson
was
stocking
at
my
heels
between
sips
as
the
expression
goes
i
addressed
the
envelope
to
harold
valentine
and
gave
it
to
hannah
she
went
out
the
front
door
with
it
as
i
had
expected
but
i
watched
from
a
window
and
she
turned
right
around
and
went
in
the
area
way
so
that
was
all
right
it
had
worked
like
a
charm
i
could
tear
my
hair
now
when
i
think
how
well
it
worked
i
ought
to
have
been
suspicious
for
that
very
reason
when
things
go
very
well
with
me
at
the
start
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
they
are
going
to
blow
up
eventually
mother
and
sis
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
i
went
out
stealthily
and
did
some
shopping
first
i
bought
myself
a
bunch
of
violets
with
a
white
rose
in
the
center
and
i
printed
on
the
card
my
love
is
like
a
white
white
rose
and
sent
it
to
myself
it
was
deception
i
acknowledge
but
having
put
my
hand
to
the
plow
i
did
not
intend
to
steer
a
crooked
course
i
would
go
straight
to
the
end
i
am
like
that
in
everything
i
do
but
on
deliberating
things
over
i
felt
that
violets
alone
and
unsupported
were
not
enough
i
felt
that
if
i
had
a
photograph
it
would
make
everything
more
real
after
all
what
is
a
love
affair
without
a
picture
of
the
beloved
object
so
i
bought
a
photograph
it
was
hard
to
find
what
i
wanted
but
i
got
it
at
last
in
a
stationer
shop
a
young
man
in
a
checked
suit
with
a
small
mustache
the
young
man
of
course
not
the
suit
unluckily
he
was
rather
blonde
and
had
a
dimple
in
his
chin
but
he
looked
exactly
as
though
his
name
ought
to
be
harold
i
may
say
here
that
i
chose
harold
not
because
it
is
a
favorite
name
of
mine
but
because
it
is
romantic
in
sound
also
because
i
had
never
known
any
one
named
harold
and
it
seemed
only
discrete
i
took
it
home
in
my
muff
and
put
it
under
my
pillow
where
hannah
would
find
it
and
probably
take
it
to
mother
i
wanted
to
buy
a
ring
too
to
hang
on
a
ribbon
around
my
neck
but
the
violets
had
made
a
fearful
hole
in
my
thirteen
dollars
i
borrowed
a
stub
pen
at
the
stationer
and
i
wrote
on
the
photograph
in
large
sprawling
letters
to
you
from
me
there
i
said
to
myself
when
i
put
it
under
the
pillow
you
look
like
a
photograph
but
you
are
really
a
as
things
eventuated
it
was
more
so
indeed
mother
sent
for
me
when
i
came
in
she
was
sitting
in
front
of
her
mirror
having
the
vibrator
used
on
her
hair
and
her
manner
was
changed
i
guessed
that
there
had
been
a
family
counsel
over
the
poem
and
that
they
had
decided
to
try
kindness
sit
down
barbara
she
said
i
hope
you
were
not
lonely
last
night
i
am
never
lonely
mother
i
always
have
things
to
think
about
i
said
this
in
a
very
pathetic
tone
what
sort
of
things
mother
asked
rather
sharply
oh
things
i
said
vaguely
life
is
such
a
mess
is
it
certainly
not
unless
one
makes
it
so
but
it
is
so
difficult
things
come
up
and
and
it
hard
to
know
what
to
do
the
only
way
i
suppose
is
to
be
true
to
one
belief
in
self
take
that
thing
off
my
head
and
go
out
hannah
mother
snapped
now
then
barbara
what
in
the
world
has
come
over
you
over
me
nothing
you
are
being
a
silly
child
i
am
no
longer
a
child
mother
i
am
seventeen
and
at
seventeen
there
are
problems
after
all
one
life
is
one
own
one
must
decide
now
barbara
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
nonsense
you
must
put
that
man
out
of
your
head
man
what
man
you
think
you
are
in
love
with
some
driveling
young
fool
i
not
blind
or
an
idiot
and
i
wo
have
it
i
have
not
said
that
there
is
anyone
have
i
i
said
in
a
gentle
voice
but
if
there
was
just
what
would
you
propose
to
do
mother
if
you
were
three
years
younger
i
propose
to
spank
you
then
i
think
she
saw
that
she
was
taking
the
wrong
method
for
she
changed
her
tactics
it
the
fault
of
that
silly
school
she
said
note
these
are
my
mother
words
not
mine
they
are
hotbeds
of
sickly
sentimentality
they
and
just
then
the
violets
came
addressed
to
me
mother
opened
them
herself
her
mouth
set
my
love
is
like
a
white
white
rose
she
said
barbara
do
you
know
who
sent
these
yes
mother
i
said
meekly
this
was
quite
true
i
did
i
am
indeed
sorry
to
record
that
here
my
mother
lost
her
temper
and
there
was
no
end
of
a
fuss
it
ended
by
mother
offering
me
a
string
of
seed
pearls
for
christmas
and
my
party
dresses
cut
v
front
and
back
if
i
would
as
she
phrased
it
put
him
out
of
my
silly
head
i
shall
have
to
write
one
letter
mother
i
said
to
to
break
things
off
i
can
not
tear
myself
out
of
another
life
without
a
word
she
sniffed
very
well
she
said
one
letter
i
trust
you
to
make
it
only
one
i
come
now
to
the
next
day
how
true
it
is
that
man
life
is
but
a
jest
a
dream
a
shadow
bubble
air
a
vapor
at
the
best
i
spent
the
morning
with
mother
at
the
dressmakers
and
she
chose
two
perfectly
spiffing
things
one
of
white
chiffon
over
silk
made
modified
empire
with
little
bunches
of
roses
here
and
there
on
it
and
when
she
and
the
dressmaker
were
haggling
over
the
roses
i
took
the
scissors
and
cut
the
neck
of
the
lining
two
inches
lower
in
front
the
effect
was
positively
impressive
the
other
was
blue
over
orchid
a
perfectly
passionate
combination
when
we
got
home
some
of
the
girls
had
dropped
in
and
carter
brooks
and
sis
were
having
tea
in
the
den
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
sis
threw
a
cigarette
in
the
fire
when
i
went
in
when
i
think
of
my
sitting
here
alone
when
i
have
done
nothing
and
sis
playing
around
and
smoking
cigarettes
and
nothing
said
all
for
a
difference
of
months
it
makes
me
furious
let
go
in
and
play
with
the
children
leila
he
said
i
feeling
young
today
which
was
perfectly
silly
he
is
not
methuselah
although
thinking
himself
so
or
almost
well
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
elaine
adams
was
there
waiting
for
me
and
betty
anderson
and
jane
raleigh
and
i
had
been
in
the
room
five
minutes
before
i
knew
that
they
all
knew
it
turned
out
later
that
hannah
was
engaged
to
the
adams
butler
and
she
had
told
him
and
he
had
told
elaine
governess
who
is
still
there
and
does
the
ordering
and
elaine
sends
her
stockings
home
for
her
to
darn
sis
had
told
carter
too
i
saw
that
and
among
them
they
had
rather
a
good
time
carter
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
chords
chanting
my
love
is
like
a
white
white
rose
only
you
know
he
said
turning
to
me
that
wrong
it
ought
to
be
a
red
rose
certainly
not
the
word
is
oh
is
it
he
said
with
his
head
on
one
side
strange
that
both
you
and
harold
should
have
got
it
wrong
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
at
that
moment
tea
came
and
carter
insisted
on
pouring
i
do
so
love
to
pour
he
said
really
after
a
long
day
shopping
tea
is
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
going
until
dinner
cream
or
lemon
leila
dear
both
sis
said
in
an
absent
manner
with
her
eyes
on
me
barbara
come
into
the
den
a
moment
i
want
to
show
you
mother
christmas
gift
she
stocked
in
ahead
of
me
and
lifted
a
book
from
the
table
under
it
was
the
photograph
you
wretched
child
she
said
where
did
you
get
that
that
not
your
affair
is
it
i
going
to
make
it
my
affair
did
he
give
it
to
you
have
you
read
what
written
on
it
where
did
you
meet
him
i
hesitated
because
i
am
by
nature
truthful
but
at
last
i
said
at
school
oh
she
said
slowly
so
you
met
him
at
school
what
was
he
doing
there
teaching
elocution
elocution
this
is
harold
is
it
certainly
well
he
was
harold
if
i
chose
to
call
him
that
he
sis
gave
a
little
sigh
you
quite
hopeless
bab
and
although
i
perfectly
sure
you
want
me
to
take
the
thing
to
mother
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
flung
it
into
the
fire
i
was
raging
it
had
cost
me
a
dollar
it
was
quite
brown
when
i
got
it
out
and
a
corner
was
burned
off
but
i
got
it
i
thank
you
to
burn
your
own
things
i
said
with
dignity
and
i
went
back
to
the
drawing
room
the
girls
and
carter
brooks
were
talking
in
an
undertone
when
i
got
there
i
knew
it
was
about
me
and
jane
came
over
to
me
and
put
her
arm
around
me
you
poor
thing
she
said
just
fight
it
out
we
all
with
you
i
so
helpless
jane
i
put
all
the
despair
i
could
into
my
voice
for
after
all
if
they
were
going
to
talk
about
my
private
affairs
behind
my
back
i
felt
that
they
might
as
well
have
something
to
talk
about
as
jane
second
cousin
once
removed
is
in
this
school
and
as
jane
will
probably
write
her
all
about
it
i
hope
this
theme
is
read
aloud
in
class
so
she
will
get
it
all
straight
jane
is
imaginative
and
may
have
a
wrong
idea
of
things
do
give
in
let
them
bully
you
they
ca
really
do
anything
and
they
scared
leila
is
positively
sick
i
promised
to
write
and
break
it
off
i
said
in
a
tense
tone
if
he
really
loves
you
said
jane
the
letter
wo
matter
there
was
a
thrill
in
her
voice
had
i
not
been
uneasy
at
my
deceit
i
to
would
have
thrilled
some
fresh
muffins
came
in
just
then
and
i
was
starving
but
i
waved
them
away
and
stood
staring
at
the
fire
i
am
writing
all
of
this
as
truthfully
as
i
can
i
am
not
defending
myself
what
i
did
i
was
driven
to
as
any
one
can
see
it
takes
a
real
shock
to
make
the
average
family
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
the
youngest
daughter
is
not
the
family
baby
at
seventeen
all
i
was
doing
was
furnishing
the
shock
if
things
turned
out
badly
as
they
did
it
was
because
i
rather
overdid
the
thing
that
is
all
my
motives
were
perfectly
irreproachable
well
they
fell
on
the
muffins
like
pigs
and
i
could
hardly
stand
it
so
i
wandered
into
the
den
and
it
occurred
to
me
to
write
the
letter
then
i
felt
that
they
all
expected
me
to
do
something
anyhow
if
i
had
never
written
the
wretched
letter
things
would
be
better
now
as
i
say
i
overdid
but
everything
had
gone
so
smoothly
all
day
that
i
was
deceived
but
the
real
reason
was
a
new
set
of
furs
i
had
secured
the
dresses
and
the
promise
of
the
necklace
on
a
poem
and
a
photograph
and
i
thought
that
a
good
love
letter
might
bring
a
muff
it
all
shows
that
it
does
not
do
to
be
grasping
had
i
not
written
the
letter
there
would
have
been
no
tragedy
but
i
wrote
it
and
if
i
do
say
it
it
was
a
letter
i
commenced
it
darling
and
i
said
i
was
mad
to
see
him
and
that
i
would
always
love
him
but
i
told
him
that
the
family
objected
to
him
and
that
this
was
to
end
everything
between
us
they
had
started
the
phonograph
in
the
library
and
were
playing
the
rosary
so
i
ended
with
a
verse
from
that
it
was
really
a
most
affecting
letter
i
almost
wept
over
it
myself
because
if
there
had
been
a
harold
it
would
have
broken
his
heart
of
course
i
meant
to
give
it
to
hannah
to
mail
and
she
would
give
it
to
mother
then
after
the
family
had
read
it
and
it
had
got
in
its
work
including
the
set
of
furs
they
were
welcome
to
mail
it
it
would
go
to
the
dead
letter
office
since
there
was
no
harold
it
could
not
come
back
to
me
for
i
had
only
signed
it
barbara
i
had
it
all
figured
out
carefully
it
looked
as
if
i
had
everything
to
gain
including
the
furs
and
nothing
to
lose
alas
how
little
i
knew
the
best
laid
plans
of
mice
and
men
gang
aft
allay
burns
carter
brooks
ambled
into
the
room
just
as
i
sealed
it
and
stood
gazing
down
at
me
you
quite
a
person
these
days
bab
he
said
i
suppose
all
the
customary
xmas
kisses
are
being
saved
this
year
for
what
his
name
i
do
understand
you
for
harold
you
know
bab
i
think
i
could
bear
up
better
if
his
name
was
harold
i
do
see
how
it
concerns
you
i
responded
do
you
with
me
crazy
about
you
for
lo
these
many
years
first
as
a
baby
then
as
a
and
now
as
a
next
year
when
you
are
a
real
debutante
you
concealed
your
infatuation
bravely
it
been
eating
me
inside
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
hello
a
letter
to
him
why
so
it
is
i
said
in
a
scornful
tone
he
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
then
he
started
and
stared
at
me
no
he
said
it
is
possible
it
is
old
valentine
positively
my
knees
got
cold
i
never
had
such
a
shock
it
it
certainly
is
harold
valentine
i
said
feebly
old
hal
he
muttered
well
who
would
have
thought
it
and
not
a
word
to
me
about
it
the
secretive
old
duffer
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
congratulations
barbara
he
said
heartily
since
you
absolutely
refuse
me
you
could
do
better
he
the
finest
chap
i
know
if
valentine
the
family
is
kicking
up
such
a
row
about
you
leave
it
to
me
i
tell
them
a
few
things
i
was
stunned
would
anybody
have
believed
it
to
pick
a
name
out
of
the
air
so
to
speak
and
off
a
malted
milk
tablet
and
then
to
find
that
it
actually
belonged
to
some
one
was
sickening
it
may
not
be
the
one
you
know
i
said
desperately
it
it
a
common
name
there
must
be
plenty
of
valentines
sure
there
are
lace
paper
and
cupids
lots
of
that
sort
but
only
one
harold
valentine
and
now
you
got
him
pinned
to
the
wall
i
tell
you
what
i
do
barbara
i
a
real
friend
of
yours
always
have
been
always
will
be
the
chances
are
against
the
family
letting
him
get
this
letter
i
give
it
to
him
give
it
to
him
why
he
here
you
know
that
do
you
he
in
town
over
the
holidays
oh
no
i
said
in
a
gasping
voice
sorry
he
said
probably
meant
it
as
a
surprise
to
you
yes
here
with
bells
on
he
then
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
before
my
very
eyes
and
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
the
writing
table
you
do
know
how
all
this
has
relieved
my
mind
he
said
the
poor
chap
been
looking
down
not
interested
in
anything
of
course
this
explains
it
he
the
sort
to
take
love
hard
at
college
he
took
everything
hard
like
to
have
died
once
with
german
measles
he
picked
up
a
book
and
the
charred
picture
was
underneath
he
pounced
on
it
pounced
is
exactly
the
right
word
hello
he
said
family
again
i
suppose
yes
it
hal
all
right
well
who
would
have
thought
it
my
last
hope
died
then
and
there
i
had
a
nervous
chill
i
was
compelled
to
prop
my
chin
on
my
hand
to
keep
my
teeth
from
chattering
tell
you
what
i
do
he
said
in
a
perfectly
cheerful
tone
that
made
me
cold
all
over
i
be
the
cupid
for
your
valentine
see
far
be
it
from
me
to
see
love
young
dream
wiped
out
by
a
hardhearted
family
i
going
to
see
this
thing
through
you
count
on
me
barbara
i
arrange
that
you
get
a
chance
to
see
each
other
family
or
no
family
old
hal
has
been
looking
down
his
nose
long
enough
when
your
first
party
tomorrow
night
i
gasped
out
very
well
tomorrow
night
it
is
it
the
adams
is
it
at
the
club
i
could
only
nod
i
was
beyond
speaking
i
saw
it
all
clearly
i
had
been
wicked
in
deceiving
my
dear
family
and
now
i
was
to
pay
the
penalty
he
would
know
at
once
that
i
had
made
him
up
or
rather
he
did
not
know
me
and
therefore
could
not
possibly
be
in
love
with
me
and
what
then
but
look
here
he
said
if
i
take
him
there
as
valentine
the
family
will
be
on
you
know
we
better
call
him
something
else
got
any
choice
as
to
a
name
carter
i
said
frantically
i
think
i
better
tell
you
i
how
about
calling
him
grosvenor
he
babbled
on
grosvenor
a
good
name
ted
grosvenor
that
ought
to
hit
them
between
the
eyes
it
going
to
be
rather
a
lark
miss
bab
and
of
course
just
then
mother
came
in
and
the
brooks
idiot
went
in
and
poured
her
a
cup
of
tea
with
his
little
finger
stuck
out
at
a
right
angel
and
every
time
he
had
a
chance
he
winked
at
me
i
wanted
to
die
when
they
had
all
gone
home
it
seemed
like
a
bad
dream
the
whole
thing
it
could
not
be
true
i
went
upstairs
and
manicured
my
nails
which
usually
comforts
me
and
put
my
hair
up
like
leila
but
nothing
could
calm
me
i
had
made
my
own
fate
and
must
lie
in
it
and
just
then
hannah
slipped
in
with
a
box
in
her
hands
and
her
eyes
frightened
oh
miss
barbara
she
said
if
your
mother
sees
this
i
dropped
my
manicure
scissors
i
was
so
alarmed
but
i
opened
the
box
and
clutched
the
envelope
inside
it
said
from
h
then
carter
was
right
there
was
an
h
after
all
hannah
was
rolling
her
hands
in
her
apron
and
her
eyes
were
popping
out
of
her
head
i
just
happened
to
see
the
boy
at
the
door
she
said
with
her
silly
teeth
chattering
oh
miss
barbara
if
patrick
had
answered
the
bell
what
shall
we
do
with
them
you
take
them
right
down
the
back
stairs
i
said
as
if
it
was
an
empty
box
and
put
it
outside
with
the
waist
papers
quick
she
gathered
the
thing
up
but
of
course
mother
had
to
come
in
just
then
and
they
met
in
the
doorway
she
saw
it
all
in
one
glance
and
she
snatched
the
card
out
of
my
hand
from
h
she
read
take
them
out
hannah
and
throw
them
away
no
do
do
that
put
them
on
the
servant
table
then
when
the
door
had
closed
she
turned
to
me
just
one
more
ridiculous
episode
of
this
kind
barbara
she
said
and
you
go
back
to
school
christmas
or
no
christmas
i
will
say
this
if
she
had
shown
the
faintest
softness
i
have
told
her
the
whole
thing
but
she
did
not
she
looked
exactly
as
gentle
as
a
macadam
pavement
i
am
one
who
has
to
be
handled
with
gentleness
a
kind
word
will
do
anything
with
me
but
harsh
treatment
only
makes
me
determined
i
then
become
inflexible
as
iron
that
is
what
happened
then
mother
took
the
wrong
course
and
threatened
which
as
i
have
stated
is
fatal
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
refused
to
yield
an
inch
and
it
ended
in
my
having
my
dinner
in
my
room
and
mother
threatening
to
keep
me
home
from
the
party
the
next
night
it
was
not
a
threat
if
she
had
only
known
it
but
when
the
next
day
went
by
with
no
more
flowers
and
nothing
apparently
wrong
except
that
mother
was
very
dignified
with
me
i
began
to
feel
better
sis
was
out
all
day
and
in
the
afternoon
jane
called
me
up
how
are
you
she
said
oh
i
all
right
everything
smooth
well
smooth
enough
oh
bab
she
said
i
just
crazy
about
it
all
the
girls
are
i
knew
they
were
crazy
about
something
you
poor
thing
no
wonder
you
are
bitter
she
said
coming
i
have
to
ring
off
but
do
you
give
in
bab
not
an
inch
marry
your
heart
desire
no
matter
who
butts
in
well
you
can
see
how
it
was
even
then
i
could
have
told
father
and
mother
and
got
out
of
it
somehow
but
all
the
girls
knew
about
it
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
on
all
that
day
every
time
i
thought
of
the
party
my
heart
missed
a
beat
but
as
i
would
not
lie
and
say
that
i
was
ill
i
am
naturally
truthful
as
far
as
possible
i
was
compelled
to
go
although
my
heart
was
breaking
i
am
not
going
to
write
much
about
the
party
except
a
slight
description
which
properly
belongs
in
every
theme
all
parties
for
the
school
set
are
alike
the
boys
range
from
knickerbockers
to
college
men
in
their
freshmen
year
and
one
is
likely
to
dance
half
the
evening
with
youngsters
that
one
saw
last
in
their
perambulators
it
is
rather
startling
to
have
about
six
feet
of
black
trouser
legs
and
white
shirt
front
come
and
ask
one
to
dance
and
then
to
get
one
eyes
raised
as
far
as
the
top
of
what
looks
like
a
particularly
thin
pair
of
tree
trunks
and
see
a
little
boy
face
as
this
theme
is
to
contain
description
i
shall
describe
the
ball
room
of
the
club
where
the
eventful
party
occurred
the
ball
room
is
white
with
red
hangings
and
looks
like
a
charlotte
russe
with
maraschino
cherries
over
the
fireplace
they
had
put
merry
christmas
in
electric
lights
and
the
chandeliers
were
made
into
christmas
trees
and
hung
with
colored
balls
one
of
the
balls
fell
off
during
the
cotillion
and
went
down
the
back
of
one
of
the
dresses
and
they
were
compelled
to
her
and
shake
her
out
in
the
dressing
room
the
favors
were
insignificant
as
usual
it
is
not
considered
good
taste
to
have
elaborate
things
for
the
school
crowd
but
when
i
think
of
the
silver
things
sis
always
brought
home
and
remember
that
i
took
away
about
six
christmas
stockings
a
toy
balloon
four
whistles
a
wooden
canary
in
a
cage
and
a
box
of
talcum
powder
i
feel
that
things
are
not
fair
in
this
world
hannah
went
with
me
and
in
the
motor
she
said
oh
miss
barbara
do
be
careful
the
family
is
that
upset
do
be
a
silly
i
said
and
if
the
family
is
half
as
upset
as
i
am
it
is
throwing
a
fit
at
this
minute
we
were
early
of
course
my
mother
believes
in
being
on
time
and
besides
she
and
sis
wanted
the
motor
later
and
while
hannah
was
on
her
knees
taking
off
my
carriage
boots
i
suddenly
decided
that
i
could
not
go
down
hannah
turned
quite
pale
when
i
told
her
what
will
your
mother
say
she
said
and
you
with
your
new
dress
and
all
it
as
much
as
my
life
is
worth
to
take
you
back
home
now
miss
barbara
well
that
was
true
enough
there
would
be
a
riot
if
i
went
home
and
i
knew
it
i
see
the
steward
and
get
you
a
cup
of
tea
hannah
said
tea
sets
me
up
like
anything
when
i
nervous
now
please
be
a
good
girl
miss
barbara
and
do
run
off
or
do
anything
foolish
she
wanted
me
to
promise
but
i
would
not
although
i
could
not
have
run
anywhere
my
legs
were
entirely
numb
in
a
half
hour
at
the
utmost
i
knew
all
would
be
known
and
very
likely
i
would
be
a
homeless
wanderer
on
the
earth
for
i
felt
that
never
never
could
i
return
to
my
dear
ones
when
my
terrible
actions
became
known
jane
came
in
while
i
was
sipping
the
tea
and
she
stood
off
and
eyed
me
with
sympathy
i
do
wonder
bab
she
said
the
idea
of
your
family
acting
so
outrageously
and
look
here
she
bent
over
me
and
whispered
it
trust
carter
too
much
he
is
perfectly
infatuated
with
leila
and
he
will
play
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
be
careful
loathsome
creature
was
my
response
as
for
trusting
him
i
trust
no
one
these
days
i
do
wonder
your
faith
is
gone
she
observed
but
she
was
talking
with
one
eye
on
a
mirror
pink
makes
me
pale
she
said
i
bet
the
maid
has
a
drawer
full
of
rouge
i
going
to
see
how
about
a
touch
for
you
you
look
ghastly
i
do
care
how
i
look
i
said
recklessly
i
think
i
sprain
my
ankle
and
go
home
anyhow
i
am
not
allowed
to
use
rouge
not
allowed
she
observed
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
understand
you
bab
you
are
totally
changed
i
am
suffering
i
said
i
was
to
just
then
the
maid
brought
me
a
folded
note
hannah
was
hanging
up
my
wraps
and
did
not
see
it
jane
eyes
fairly
bulged
i
hope
you
have
saved
the
cotillion
for
me
it
said
and
it
was
signed
h
good
gracious
jane
said
breathlessly
do
tell
me
he
is
here
and
that
that
from
him
i
had
to
swallow
twice
before
i
could
speak
then
i
said
solemnly
he
is
here
jane
he
has
followed
me
i
am
going
to
dance
the
cotillion
with
him
although
i
shall
probably
be
disinherited
and
thrown
out
into
the
world
as
a
result
i
have
no
recollection
whatever
of
going
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
ballroom
although
i
am
considered
rather
brave
and
once
saved
one
of
the
smaller
girls
from
drowning
as
i
need
not
remind
the
school
when
she
was
skating
on
thin
ice
i
was
frightened
i
remember
that
inside
the
door
jane
said
courage
in
a
low
tense
voice
and
that
i
stepped
on
somebody
foot
and
said
certainly
instead
of
apologizing
the
shock
of
that
brought
me
around
somewhat
and
i
managed
to
find
adams
and
elaine
and
not
disgrace
myself
then
somebody
at
my
elbow
said
all
right
barbara
everything
fixed
it
was
carter
he
waiting
in
the
corner
over
there
he
said
we
better
go
through
the
formality
of
an
introduction
he
positively
twittering
with
excitement
carter
i
said
desperately
i
want
to
tell
you
something
first
got
myself
in
an
awful
mess
i
sure
you
have
he
said
that
why
i
here
to
help
you
out
now
you
be
calm
and
there
no
reason
why
you
two
ca
have
the
evening
of
your
young
lives
i
wish
i
could
fall
in
love
it
must
be
bully
carter
got
his
note
did
you
yes
i
here
we
are
said
carter
miss
archibald
i
would
like
to
present
mr
grosvenor
somebody
bowed
in
front
of
me
and
then
straightened
up
and
looked
down
at
me
it
was
the
man
of
the
picture
little
mustache
and
all
my
mouth
went
perfectly
dry
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
romance
and
love
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
have
concluded
that
amorous
experiences
are
not
always
agreeable
and
i
have
discovered
something
else
the
moment
anybody
is
crazy
about
me
i
begin
to
hate
him
it
is
curious
but
i
am
like
that
i
only
care
as
long
as
they
or
he
is
far
away
and
the
moment
i
touched
h
white
kid
glove
i
knew
i
loathed
him
now
go
to
it
you
two
carter
said
in
cautious
tone
do
be
conspicuous
that
all
and
he
left
us
suppose
we
dance
this
shall
we
said
and
the
next
moment
we
were
gliding
off
he
danced
very
well
i
will
say
that
but
at
the
time
i
was
too
much
occupied
with
hating
him
to
care
about
dancing
or
anything
but
i
was
compelled
by
my
pride
to
see
things
through
we
are
a
very
proud
family
and
never
show
our
troubles
though
our
hearts
be
torn
with
anguish
think
he
said
when
we
had
got
away
from
the
band
think
of
our
being
together
like
this
it
not
so
surprising
is
it
we
got
to
be
together
if
we
are
dancing
not
that
do
you
know
i
never
knew
so
long
a
day
as
this
has
been
the
thought
of
meeting
you
er
again
and
all
that
you
need
rave
for
my
benefit
i
said
freezingly
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
never
saw
me
before
barbara
with
your
dear
little
letter
in
my
breast
pocket
at
this
moment
i
did
know
men
had
breast
pockets
in
their
evening
clothes
oh
well
have
it
your
own
way
i
too
happy
to
quarrel
he
said
how
well
you
dance
only
let
me
lead
wo
you
how
strange
it
is
to
think
that
we
have
never
danced
together
before
we
must
have
a
talk
i
said
desperately
ca
we
go
somewhere
away
from
the
noise
that
would
be
conspicuous
would
it
under
the
circumstances
if
we
are
to
overcome
the
family
objection
to
me
we
have
to
be
cautious
barbara
do
call
me
barbara
i
snapped
i
know
perfectly
well
what
you
think
of
me
and
i
i
think
you
are
wonderful
he
said
words
fail
me
when
i
try
to
tell
you
what
i
am
thinking
you
saved
the
cotillion
for
me
have
you
if
not
i
going
to
claim
it
anyhow
it
is
my
right
he
said
it
in
the
most
determined
manner
as
if
everything
was
settled
i
felt
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
and
carter
watching
from
a
corner
looked
exactly
like
a
cat
if
he
had
taken
his
hand
in
its
white
glove
and
washed
his
face
with
it
i
would
hardly
have
been
surprised
the
music
stopped
and
somebody
claimed
me
for
the
next
jane
came
up
too
and
clutched
my
arm
you
lucky
thing
she
said
he
perfectly
handsome
and
oh
bab
wild
about
you
i
can
see
it
in
his
eyes
do
pinch
jane
i
said
coldly
and
do
rave
he
an
idiot
she
looked
at
me
with
her
mouth
open
well
if
you
do
want
him
pass
him
on
to
me
she
said
and
walked
away
it
was
too
silly
after
everything
that
had
happened
to
dance
the
next
dance
with
willie
graham
who
is
still
in
knickerbockers
and
a
full
head
shorter
than
i
am
but
that
the
way
with
a
party
for
the
school
crowd
as
i
said
before
they
ask
all
ages
from
perambulators
up
and
of
course
the
little
boys
all
want
to
dance
with
the
older
girls
it
is
deadly
stupid
but
h
seemed
to
be
having
a
good
time
he
danced
a
lot
with
jane
who
is
a
wretched
dancer
with
no
sense
of
time
whatever
jane
is
not
pretty
but
she
has
nice
eyes
and
i
am
not
afraid
second
cousin
once
removed
or
no
second
cousin
once
removed
to
say
she
used
them
altogether
it
was
a
terrible
evening
i
danced
three
dances
out
of
four
with
knickerbockers
and
one
with
old
adams
who
is
fat
and
rotates
his
partner
at
the
corners
by
swinging
her
on
his
waistcoat
carter
did
not
dance
at
all
and
every
time
i
tried
to
speak
to
him
he
was
taking
a
crowd
of
the
little
girls
to
the
bowl
i
determined
to
have
things
out
with
h
during
the
cotillion
and
tell
him
that
i
would
never
marry
him
that
i
would
die
first
but
i
was
favored
a
great
deal
and
when
we
did
have
a
chance
the
music
was
making
such
a
noise
that
i
would
have
had
to
shout
our
chairs
were
next
to
the
band
but
at
last
we
had
a
minute
and
i
went
out
to
the
verandah
which
was
closed
in
with
awnings
he
had
to
follow
of
course
and
i
turned
and
faced
him
now
i
said
this
has
got
to
stop
i
do
understand
you
bab
you
do
perfectly
well
i
stormed
i
ca
stand
it
i
am
going
crazy
oh
he
said
slowly
i
see
i
been
dancing
too
much
with
the
little
girl
with
the
eyes
honestly
bab
i
was
only
doing
it
to
disarm
suspicion
my
every
thought
is
of
you
i
mean
i
said
as
firmly
as
i
could
that
this
whole
thing
has
got
to
stop
i
ca
stand
it
am
i
to
understand
he
said
solemnly
that
you
intend
to
end
everything
i
felt
perfectly
wild
and
helpless
after
that
letter
he
went
on
after
that
sweet
letter
you
said
you
know
that
you
were
mad
to
see
me
and
that
it
is
almost
too
sacred
to
repeat
even
to
you
that
you
would
always
love
me
after
that
confession
i
refuse
to
agree
that
all
is
over
it
can
never
be
over
i
daresay
i
am
losing
my
mind
i
said
it
all
sounds
perfectly
natural
but
it
does
mean
anything
there
ca
be
any
harold
valentine
because
i
made
him
up
but
there
is
so
there
must
be
and
i
am
going
crazy
look
here
he
stormed
suddenly
quite
raving
and
throwing
out
his
right
hand
it
would
have
been
terribly
dramatic
only
he
had
a
glass
of
punch
in
it
i
am
not
going
to
be
played
with
and
you
are
not
going
to
jilt
me
without
a
reason
do
you
mean
to
deny
everything
are
you
going
to
say
for
instance
that
i
never
sent
you
any
violets
or
gave
you
my
photograph
with
an
er
touching
inscription
on
it
then
appealingly
you
ca
mean
to
deny
that
photograph
bab
and
then
that
lanky
wretch
of
an
eddie
perkins
brought
me
a
toy
balloon
and
i
had
to
dance
with
my
heart
crushed
nevertheless
i
ate
a
fair
supper
i
felt
that
i
needed
strength
it
was
quite
a
supper
with
bullion
and
creamed
chicken
and
baked
ham
and
sandwiches
among
other
things
but
of
course
they
had
to
show
it
was
a
party
after
all
for
instead
of
coffee
we
had
milk
milk
when
i
was
going
through
a
tragedy
for
if
it
is
not
a
tragedy
to
be
engaged
to
a
man
one
never
saw
before
what
is
it
all
through
the
refreshments
i
could
feel
that
his
eyes
were
on
me
and
i
hated
him
it
was
all
well
enough
for
jane
to
say
he
was
handsome
she
was
going
to
have
to
marry
him
i
detest
dimples
in
chins
i
always
have
and
anybody
could
see
that
it
was
his
first
mustache
and
soft
and
that
he
took
it
round
like
a
mother
pushing
a
new
baby
in
a
perambulator
it
was
sickening
i
left
just
after
supper
he
did
not
see
me
when
i
went
upstairs
but
he
had
missed
me
for
when
hannah
and
i
came
down
he
was
at
the
door
waiting
hannah
was
loaded
down
with
silly
favors
and
lagged
behind
which
gave
him
a
chance
to
speak
to
me
i
eyed
him
coldly
and
tried
to
pass
him
but
i
had
no
chance
i
see
you
tomorrow
dearest
he
whispered
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
said
looking
straight
ahead
hannah
had
dropped
a
stocking
not
her
own
one
of
the
christmas
favors
and
was
fumbling
about
for
it
you
are
tired
and
unnerved
bab
when
i
have
seen
your
father
tomorrow
and
talked
to
him
do
you
dare
to
see
my
father
and
when
he
has
agreed
to
what
i
propose
he
went
on
without
paying
any
attention
to
what
i
had
said
you
will
be
calmer
we
can
plan
things
hannah
came
puffing
up
then
and
he
helped
us
into
the
motor
he
was
very
careful
to
see
that
we
were
covered
with
the
robes
and
he
tucked
hannah
feet
in
she
was
awfully
flattered
old
fool
and
she
babbled
about
him
until
i
wanted
to
slap
her
he
a
nice
young
man
miss
bab
she
said
that
is
if
he
the
one
and
he
has
nice
manners
so
considerate
many
a
party
i
taken
your
sister
to
and
never
before
i
wish
you
shut
up
hannah
i
said
he
a
pig
and
i
hate
him
she
sulked
after
that
and
helped
me
out
of
my
things
at
home
without
a
word
when
i
was
in
bed
however
and
she
was
hanging
up
my
clothes
she
said
i
do
know
what
got
into
you
miss
barbara
you
are
that
cross
that
there
no
living
with
you
oh
go
away
i
said
and
what
more
she
added
i
do
know
but
what
your
mother
ought
to
know
about
these
goings
on
you
only
a
little
girl
with
all
your
high
and
mightiness
and
there
going
to
be
no
scandal
in
this
family
if
i
can
help
it
i
put
the
bedclothes
over
my
head
and
she
went
out
but
of
course
i
could
not
sleep
sis
was
not
home
yet
or
mother
and
i
went
into
sis
room
and
got
a
novel
from
her
table
it
was
the
story
of
a
woman
who
had
married
a
man
in
a
hurry
and
without
really
loving
him
and
when
she
had
been
married
a
year
and
hated
the
very
way
her
husband
drank
his
coffee
and
cut
the
ends
off
his
cigars
she
found
some
one
she
really
loved
with
her
whole
heart
and
it
was
too
late
but
she
wrote
him
one
letter
the
other
man
you
know
and
it
caused
a
lot
of
trouble
so
she
said
i
remember
the
very
words
half
the
troubles
in
the
world
are
caused
by
letters
emotions
are
changeable
things
this
was
after
she
had
found
that
she
really
loved
her
husband
after
all
but
he
had
had
to
shoot
himself
before
she
found
it
out
although
not
fatally
but
the
written
word
does
not
change
it
remains
always
embodying
a
dead
truth
and
giving
it
apparent
life
no
woman
should
ever
put
her
thoughts
on
paper
she
got
the
letter
back
but
she
had
to
steal
it
and
it
turned
out
that
the
other
man
had
really
only
wanted
her
money
all
the
time
that
story
was
a
real
illumination
to
me
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
of
money
when
i
am
of
age
from
my
grandmother
i
saw
it
all
it
was
a
trap
sure
enough
and
if
i
was
to
get
out
i
would
have
to
have
the
letter
it
was
the
letter
that
put
me
in
his
power
the
next
day
was
christmas
i
got
a
lot
of
things
including
the
necklace
and
a
mending
basket
from
sis
with
the
hope
that
it
would
make
me
tidy
and
father
had
bought
me
a
set
of
silver
fox
which
mother
did
not
approve
of
it
being
too
expensive
for
a
young
girl
to
wear
according
to
her
i
must
say
that
for
an
hour
or
two
i
was
happy
enough
but
the
afternoon
was
terrible
we
keep
open
house
on
xmas
afternoon
and
father
makes
a
champagne
punch
and
somebody
pours
tea
although
nobody
drinks
it
and
there
are
little
cakes
from
the
club
and
the
house
is
decorated
with
poinsettias
at
eleven
the
mail
came
in
and
mother
sorted
it
over
while
father
took
a
gold
piece
out
to
the
there
were
about
a
million
cards
and
mother
glanced
at
the
addresses
and
passed
them
round
but
suddenly
she
frowned
there
was
a
small
parcel
addressed
to
me
this
looks
like
a
gift
barbara
she
said
and
proceeded
to
open
it
my
heart
skipped
two
beats
and
then
hammered
mother
mouth
was
set
as
she
tore
off
the
paper
and
opened
the
box
there
was
a
card
which
she
glanced
at
and
underneath
was
a
book
of
poems
love
lyrics
said
mother
in
a
terrible
voice
to
barbara
from
h
mother
i
began
in
an
earnest
tone
a
child
of
mine
receiving
such
a
book
from
a
man
she
went
on
barbara
i
am
speechless
but
she
was
not
speechless
if
she
was
speechless
for
the
next
half
hour
i
would
hate
to
hear
her
really
converse
and
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
bear
it
for
i
had
made
a
frankenstein
see
the
book
read
last
term
by
the
literary
society
not
out
of
fragments
but
from
malted
milk
tablets
so
to
speak
and
now
it
was
pursuing
me
to
an
early
grave
for
i
felt
that
i
simply
could
not
continue
to
live
now
where
does
he
live
i
do
know
mother
you
sent
him
a
letter
i
do
know
where
he
lives
anyhow
leila
mother
said
will
you
ask
hannah
to
bring
my
smelling
salts
are
you
going
to
give
me
the
book
i
asked
it
it
sounds
interesting
you
are
shameless
mother
said
and
threw
the
thing
into
the
fire
a
good
many
of
my
things
seemed
to
be
going
into
the
fire
at
that
time
i
can
not
help
wondering
what
they
would
have
done
if
it
had
all
happened
in
the
summer
and
no
fires
burning
they
would
have
felt
quite
helpless
i
imagine
father
came
back
just
then
but
he
did
not
see
the
book
which
was
then
blazing
with
a
very
hot
red
flame
i
expected
mother
to
tell
him
and
i
daresay
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
my
furs
follow
the
book
i
had
got
into
the
way
of
expecting
to
see
things
burning
that
do
not
belong
in
a
fireplace
but
mother
did
not
tell
him
i
have
thought
over
this
a
great
deal
and
i
believe
that
now
i
understand
mother
was
unjustly
putting
the
blame
for
everything
on
this
school
and
mother
had
chosen
the
school
my
father
had
not
been
much
impressed
by
the
catalog
too
much
dancing
room
and
not
enough
tennis
courts
he
had
said
this
of
course
is
my
father
opinion
not
mine
the
real
reason
then
for
mother
silence
was
that
she
disliked
confessing
that
she
made
a
mistake
in
her
choice
of
a
school
i
ate
very
little
luncheon
and
my
only
comfort
was
my
seed
pearls
i
was
wearing
them
for
fear
the
would
ring
and
a
letter
or
flowers
would
arrive
from
in
that
case
i
felt
quite
sure
that
someone
in
a
frenzy
would
burn
the
pearls
also
the
afternoon
was
terrible
it
rained
solid
sheets
and
patrick
the
butler
gave
notice
three
hours
after
he
had
received
his
christmas
presents
on
account
of
not
being
let
off
for
early
mass
but
my
father
punch
is
famous
and
people
came
and
stood
around
and
buzzed
and
told
me
i
had
grown
and
was
almost
a
young
lady
and
tommy
gray
got
out
of
his
cradle
and
came
to
call
on
me
and
coughed
all
the
time
with
a
whoop
he
developed
the
whooping
cough
later
he
had
on
his
first
long
trousers
and
a
pair
of
lavender
socks
and
a
tie
to
match
he
said
they
were
not
exactly
the
same
shade
but
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
noticed
hateful
child
at
half
past
five
when
the
place
was
jammed
i
happened
to
look
up
carter
brooks
was
in
the
hall
and
behind
him
was
he
had
seen
me
before
i
saw
him
and
he
had
a
sort
of
sickly
grin
meant
to
denote
joy
i
was
talking
to
our
bishop
at
the
time
and
he
was
asking
me
what
sort
of
services
we
had
in
the
school
chapel
i
meant
to
say
but
in
my
surprise
and
horror
i
regret
to
say
that
i
said
vegetarian
carter
brooks
came
over
to
me
like
a
cat
to
a
saucer
of
milk
and
pulled
me
off
into
a
corner
it
all
right
he
said
i
phoned
mama
and
she
said
to
bring
him
he
known
as
grosvenor
here
of
course
they
never
suspect
a
thing
now
do
i
get
a
small
you
i
wo
see
him
now
look
here
bab
he
protested
you
two
have
got
to
make
this
thing
up
you
are
a
pair
of
idiots
quarreling
over
nothing
poor
old
hal
is
all
broken
up
he
sensitive
you
got
to
remember
how
sensitive
he
is
go
away
i
cried
in
broken
tones
go
away
and
take
him
with
you
not
until
he
had
spoken
to
your
father
he
observed
setting
his
jaw
he
here
for
that
and
you
know
it
you
ca
play
fast
and
loose
with
a
man
you
know
do
you
dare
to
let
him
speak
to
father
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
between
you
two
of
course
he
said
it
not
up
to
me
tell
him
yourself
if
you
changed
your
mind
i
do
intend
he
went
on
impressively
to
have
any
share
in
ruining
his
life
oh
piffle
i
said
i
am
aware
that
this
is
slang
and
does
not
belong
in
a
theme
but
i
was
driven
to
saying
it
i
got
through
the
crowd
by
using
my
elbows
i
am
afraid
i
gave
the
bishop
quite
a
prod
and
i
caught
andrews
on
his
rotating
waistcoat
but
i
was
desperate
alas
i
was
too
late
the
caterer
man
who
had
taken
patrick
place
in
a
hurry
was
at
the
punch
bowl
and
father
was
gone
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
take
into
his
library
and
close
the
door
here
words
fail
me
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
beyond
that
door
h
whom
i
had
invented
and
who
therefore
simply
did
not
exist
was
asking
for
my
hand
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
to
run
away
and
go
on
the
stage
and
i
had
even
got
part
way
up
the
stairs
when
i
remembered
that
with
a
dollar
for
the
picture
and
five
dollars
for
the
violets
and
three
dollars
for
the
hat
pin
i
had
given
sis
and
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
for
mother
handkerchief
case
i
had
exactly
a
dollar
and
cents
in
the
world
i
was
trapped
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
sat
and
waited
would
father
be
violent
and
throw
out
and
then
come
upstairs
pale
with
fury
and
disinherit
me
or
would
the
whole
family
conspire
together
when
the
people
had
gone
and
send
me
to
a
convent
i
made
up
my
mind
if
it
was
the
convent
to
take
the
veil
and
be
a
nun
i
would
go
to
nurse
lepers
or
something
and
then
when
it
was
too
late
they
would
be
sorry
the
stage
or
the
convent
nun
or
actress
which
i
left
the
door
open
but
there
was
only
the
sound
of
revelry
below
i
felt
then
that
it
was
to
be
the
convent
i
pinned
a
towel
around
my
face
the
way
the
nuns
wear
whatever
they
call
them
and
from
the
side
it
was
very
becoming
i
really
did
look
like
julia
marlowe
especially
as
my
face
was
very
sad
and
tragic
at
something
before
seven
every
one
had
gone
and
i
heard
sis
and
mother
come
upstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
i
sat
and
waited
and
when
i
heard
father
i
got
cold
all
over
but
he
went
on
by
and
i
heard
him
go
into
mother
room
and
close
the
door
well
i
knew
i
had
to
go
through
with
it
although
my
life
was
blasted
so
i
dressed
and
went
downstairs
father
was
the
first
down
he
came
down
whistling
it
is
perfectly
true
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
he
approached
me
with
a
smiling
face
well
bab
he
said
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
have
you
had
a
nice
day
he
had
the
eyes
of
a
basilisk
that
creature
of
fable
i
had
a
lovely
day
father
i
replied
i
could
be
also
there
is
a
mirror
over
the
drawing
room
mantle
and
he
turned
me
around
until
we
both
faced
it
up
to
my
ears
he
said
referring
to
my
height
and
lovers
already
well
i
daresay
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
lose
you
i
wo
be
lost
i
declared
almost
violently
of
course
if
you
intend
to
shove
me
off
your
hands
to
the
first
idiot
who
comes
along
and
pretends
a
lot
of
stuff
i
my
dear
child
said
father
looking
surprised
such
an
outburst
all
i
was
trying
to
say
before
your
mother
comes
down
is
that
i
well
that
i
understand
and
that
i
shall
not
make
my
little
girl
unhappy
by
er
by
breaking
her
heart
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
father
he
looked
rather
uncomfortable
being
one
who
hates
to
talk
sentiment
it
like
this
barbara
he
said
if
you
want
to
marry
this
young
man
and
you
have
made
it
very
clear
that
you
do
i
am
going
to
see
that
you
do
it
you
are
young
of
course
but
after
all
your
dear
mother
was
not
much
older
than
you
are
when
i
married
her
father
i
cried
from
an
heart
i
have
noticed
that
you
are
not
happy
barbara
he
said
and
i
shall
not
thwart
you
or
allow
you
to
be
thwarted
in
affairs
of
the
heart
you
are
to
have
your
own
way
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
cried
i
will
not
be
cast
off
i
tut
tut
said
father
who
is
casting
you
off
i
tell
you
that
i
like
the
young
man
and
give
you
my
blessing
or
what
is
the
equivalent
for
it
and
you
look
like
a
figure
of
tragedy
but
i
could
endure
no
more
my
own
father
had
turned
on
me
and
was
rending
me
so
to
speak
with
a
breaking
heart
and
streaming
eyes
i
flew
to
my
chamber
there
for
hours
i
paced
the
floor
never
i
determined
would
i
marry
better
death
by
far
he
was
a
scheming
but
to
tell
the
family
that
was
to
confess
all
and
i
would
never
confess
i
would
run
away
before
i
gave
sis
such
a
chance
at
me
i
would
run
away
but
first
i
would
kill
carter
brooks
yes
i
was
driven
to
thoughts
of
murder
it
shows
how
the
first
false
step
leads
down
and
down
to
crime
and
even
to
death
oh
never
never
gentle
reader
take
that
first
false
step
who
knows
to
what
it
may
lead
one
false
step
is
never
retrieved
gray
on
a
favorite
cat
i
reflected
also
on
how
the
woman
in
the
book
had
ruined
her
life
with
a
letter
the
written
word
does
not
change
she
had
said
it
remains
always
embodying
a
dead
truth
and
giving
it
apparent
life
apparent
life
was
exactly
what
my
letter
had
given
to
frankenstein
that
was
what
i
called
him
in
my
agony
i
felt
that
if
only
i
had
never
written
the
letter
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
and
another
awful
thought
came
to
me
was
there
an
h
after
all
could
there
be
an
h
once
the
french
teacher
had
taken
us
to
the
theater
in
new
york
and
a
woman
sitting
on
a
chair
and
covered
with
a
sheet
had
brought
a
man
out
of
a
perfectly
empty
cabinet
by
simply
willing
to
do
it
the
cabinet
was
empty
for
four
respectable
looking
men
went
up
and
examined
it
and
one
even
measured
it
with
a
she
had
materialized
him
out
of
nothing
and
while
i
had
had
no
cabinet
there
are
many
things
in
this
world
that
we
do
not
dream
of
in
our
philosophy
was
a
real
person
or
a
creature
of
my
disordered
brain
in
plain
and
simple
language
could
there
be
such
a
person
i
feared
not
and
if
there
was
no
h
really
and
i
married
him
where
would
i
be
there
was
a
ball
at
the
club
that
night
and
the
family
all
went
no
one
came
to
say
to
me
and
by
half
past
ten
i
was
alone
with
my
misery
i
knew
carter
brooks
would
be
at
the
ball
and
h
also
very
likely
dancing
around
as
agreeably
as
if
he
really
existed
and
i
had
not
made
him
up
i
got
the
book
from
sis
room
again
and
it
the
woman
in
it
had
been
in
great
trouble
too
with
her
husband
cleaning
his
revolver
and
making
his
will
and
at
last
she
had
gone
to
the
apartments
of
the
man
who
had
her
letters
in
a
taxicab
covered
with
a
heavy
veil
and
had
got
them
back
he
had
shot
himself
when
she
returned
the
husband
but
she
burned
the
letters
and
then
called
a
doctor
and
he
was
saved
not
the
doctor
of
course
the
husband
the
villain
only
hold
on
her
had
been
the
letters
so
he
went
to
south
africa
and
was
gored
by
an
elephant
thus
passing
out
of
her
life
then
and
there
i
knew
that
i
would
have
to
get
my
letter
back
from
without
it
he
was
powerless
the
trouble
was
that
i
did
not
know
where
he
was
staying
even
if
he
came
out
of
a
cabinet
the
cabinet
would
have
to
be
somewhere
would
it
not
i
felt
that
i
would
have
to
meet
guile
with
guile
and
to
steal
one
own
letter
is
not
really
stealing
of
course
if
he
was
visiting
any
one
and
pretending
to
be
a
real
person
i
had
no
chance
in
the
world
but
if
he
was
stopping
at
a
hotel
i
thought
i
could
manage
the
man
in
the
book
had
had
an
apartment
with
a
japanese
servant
who
went
away
and
drew
plans
of
american
forts
in
the
kitchen
and
left
the
woman
alone
with
the
desk
containing
the
letter
but
i
daresay
that
was
unusually
lucky
and
not
the
sort
of
thing
to
look
forward
to
with
me
to
think
is
to
act
hannah
was
out
it
being
christmas
and
her
having
a
wake
being
dead
so
i
was
free
to
do
anything
i
wanted
to
first
i
called
the
club
and
got
carter
brooks
on
the
telephone
carter
i
said
i
i
am
writing
a
letter
where
is
where
does
h
stay
who
mr
grosvenor
why
bless
your
ardent
little
heart
writing
are
you
it
sublime
bab
where
does
he
live
and
is
it
all
alone
you
are
on
christmas
night
he
burbled
this
is
a
word
from
alice
in
wonder
land
and
although
not
in
the
dictionary
is
quite
expressive
yes
i
replied
bitterly
i
am
old
enough
to
be
married
off
without
my
consent
but
i
am
not
old
enough
for
a
real
ball
it
makes
me
sick
i
can
smuggle
him
here
if
you
want
to
talk
to
him
smuggle
i
said
with
scorn
there
is
no
need
to
smuggle
him
the
family
is
crazy
about
him
they
are
flinging
me
at
him
well
that
nice
he
said
who
have
thought
it
shall
i
bring
him
to
the
i
do
want
to
talk
to
him
i
hate
him
look
here
he
observed
if
you
keep
that
up
he
begin
to
believe
you
do
take
these
little
quarrels
too
hard
barbara
he
so
happy
in
the
thought
that
you
does
he
live
in
a
cabinet
or
where
in
a
what
i
do
get
that
word
do
bother
where
shall
i
send
his
letter
well
it
seemed
he
had
an
apartment
at
the
arcade
and
i
rang
off
it
was
after
eleven
by
that
time
and
by
the
time
i
had
got
into
my
school
mackintosh
and
found
a
heavy
veil
of
mother
and
put
it
on
it
was
almost
half
past
the
house
was
quiet
and
as
patrick
had
gone
there
was
no
one
around
in
the
lower
hall
i
slipped
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
looked
for
a
taxicab
but
the
veil
was
so
heavy
that
i
hailed
our
own
limousine
and
smith
had
drawn
up
at
the
curb
before
i
knew
him
where
to
lady
he
said
this
is
a
private
car
but
i
take
you
anywhere
in
the
city
for
a
dollar
a
flush
of
just
indignation
rose
to
my
cheek
at
the
knowledge
that
smith
was
using
our
car
for
a
taxicab
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
speak
to
him
severely
and
threaten
to
tell
father
i
remembered
and
walked
away
make
it
cents
he
called
after
me
but
i
went
on
it
was
terrible
to
think
that
smith
could
go
on
renting
our
car
to
all
sorts
of
people
covered
with
germs
and
everything
and
that
i
could
never
report
it
to
the
family
i
got
a
real
taxi
at
last
and
got
out
at
the
arcade
giving
the
man
a
quarter
although
ten
cents
would
have
been
plenty
as
a
tip
i
looked
at
him
and
i
felt
that
he
could
be
trusted
this
i
said
holding
up
the
money
is
the
price
of
silence
but
if
he
was
trustworthy
he
was
not
subtle
and
he
said
the
what
miss
if
any
one
asks
if
you
have
driven
me
here
you
have
not
i
explained
in
an
impressive
manner
he
examined
the
quarter
even
striking
a
match
to
look
at
it
then
he
replied
i
have
not
and
drove
away
concealing
my
nervousness
as
best
i
could
i
entered
the
doomed
building
there
was
only
a
hall
boy
there
asleep
in
the
elevator
and
i
looked
at
the
thing
with
the
names
on
it
grosvenor
was
on
the
fourth
floor
i
wakened
the
boy
and
he
yawned
and
took
me
to
the
fourth
floor
my
hands
were
stiff
with
nervousness
by
that
time
but
the
boy
was
half
asleep
and
evidently
he
took
me
for
some
one
who
belonged
there
for
he
said
goodnight
to
me
and
went
on
down
there
was
a
square
landing
with
two
doors
and
grosvenor
was
on
one
i
tried
it
gently
it
was
unlocked
facilus
descensus
in
avernu
i
am
not
defending
myself
what
i
did
was
the
result
of
desperation
but
i
can
not
even
write
of
my
sensations
as
i
stepped
through
that
fatal
portal
without
a
sinking
of
the
heart
i
had
however
had
sufficient
foresight
to
prepare
an
alibi
in
case
there
was
someone
present
in
the
apartment
i
intended
to
tell
a
falsehood
i
regret
to
confess
and
to
say
that
i
had
got
off
at
the
wrong
floor
there
was
a
sort
of
hall
with
a
clock
and
a
table
and
a
shaded
electric
lamp
and
beyond
that
the
door
was
open
into
a
sitting
room
there
was
a
small
light
burning
there
and
the
remains
of
a
wood
fire
in
the
fireplace
there
was
no
cabinet
however
everything
was
perfectly
quiet
and
i
went
over
to
the
fire
and
warmed
my
hands
my
nails
were
quite
blue
but
i
was
strangely
calm
i
took
off
mother
veil
and
my
mackintosh
so
i
would
be
free
to
work
and
i
then
looked
around
the
room
there
were
a
number
of
photographs
of
rather
smart
looking
girls
and
i
curled
my
lip
scornfully
he
might
have
fooled
them
but
he
could
not
deceive
me
and
it
added
to
my
bitterness
to
think
that
at
that
moment
the
villain
was
dancing
and
flirting
probably
while
i
was
driven
to
actual
theft
to
secure
the
letter
that
placed
me
in
his
power
when
i
had
stopped
shivering
i
went
to
his
desk
there
were
a
lot
of
letters
on
the
top
all
addressed
to
him
as
grosvenor
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
strange
that
if
he
was
only
visiting
under
an
assumed
name
in
order
to
see
me
that
so
many
people
should
be
writing
to
him
as
grosvenor
and
it
did
not
look
like
the
room
of
a
man
who
was
visiting
unless
he
took
a
freight
car
with
him
on
his
travels
there
was
a
mystery
all
at
once
i
knew
it
my
letter
was
not
on
the
desk
so
i
opened
the
top
drawer
it
seemed
to
be
full
of
bills
and
so
was
the
one
below
it
i
had
just
started
on
the
third
drawer
when
a
terrible
thing
happened
hello
said
some
one
behind
me
i
turned
my
head
slowly
and
my
heart
stopped
the
porteres
into
the
passage
had
opened
and
a
gentleman
in
his
evening
clothes
was
standing
there
just
sit
still
please
he
said
in
a
perfectly
cold
voice
and
he
turned
and
locked
the
door
into
the
hall
i
was
absolutely
unable
to
speak
i
tried
once
but
my
tongue
hit
the
roof
of
my
mouth
like
the
clapper
of
a
bell
now
he
said
when
he
had
turned
around
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
some
good
reason
why
i
should
not
hand
you
over
to
the
police
oh
please
do
i
said
that
eloquent
but
not
a
reason
i
sit
down
and
give
you
a
little
time
i
take
it
you
did
not
expect
to
find
me
here
i
in
the
wrong
apartment
that
all
i
said
maybe
you
think
that
an
excuse
and
not
a
reason
i
ca
help
it
if
you
do
well
he
said
that
explains
some
things
it
pretty
well
known
i
fancy
that
i
have
little
worth
stealing
except
my
good
name
i
was
not
stealing
i
replied
in
a
sulky
manner
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
it
is
an
ugly
word
we
will
strike
it
from
the
record
would
you
mind
telling
me
whose
apartment
you
intended
to
er
investigate
if
this
is
the
wrong
one
you
know
i
was
looking
for
a
letter
letters
letters
he
said
when
will
you
women
learn
not
to
write
letters
although
he
looked
at
me
closely
you
look
rather
young
for
that
sort
of
thing
he
sighed
it
born
in
you
i
daresay
he
said
well
for
all
his
patronizing
ways
he
was
not
very
old
himself
of
course
he
said
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
and
it
sounds
fishy
i
must
say
it
hardly
a
police
matter
is
it
it
rather
one
for
diplomacy
but
can
you
prove
what
you
say
my
word
should
be
sufficient
i
replied
stiffly
how
do
i
know
that
you
belong
here
well
you
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
suppose
you
take
my
word
for
that
and
i
agree
to
believe
what
you
say
about
the
wrong
apartment
even
then
it
rather
unusual
i
find
a
pale
and
determined
looking
young
lady
going
through
my
desk
in
a
manner
she
says
she
has
come
for
a
letter
now
the
question
is
is
there
a
letter
if
so
what
letter
it
is
a
love
letter
i
said
do
blush
over
such
a
confession
he
said
if
it
is
true
be
proud
of
it
love
is
a
wonderful
thing
never
be
ashamed
of
being
in
love
my
child
i
am
not
in
love
i
cried
with
bitter
fury
ah
then
it
is
not
your
letter
i
wrote
it
but
to
simulate
a
passion
that
does
not
exist
that
is
sacrilege
it
is
oh
stop
talking
i
cried
in
a
hunted
tone
i
ca
bear
it
if
you
are
going
to
arrest
me
get
it
over
i
rather
not
arrest
you
if
we
can
find
a
way
out
you
look
so
young
so
new
to
crime
even
your
excuse
for
being
here
is
so
naive
that
i
wo
you
tell
me
why
you
wrote
a
love
letter
if
you
are
not
in
love
and
whom
you
sent
it
to
that
important
you
see
as
it
bears
on
the
case
i
intend
he
said
to
be
judicial
unimpassioned
and
quite
fair
i
wrote
a
love
letter
i
explained
feeling
rather
cheered
but
it
was
not
intended
for
any
one
do
you
see
it
was
just
a
love
letter
oh
he
said
of
course
it
is
often
done
and
after
that
well
it
had
to
go
somewhere
at
least
i
felt
that
way
about
it
so
i
made
up
a
name
from
some
malted
milk
tablets
malted
milk
tablets
he
said
looking
bewildered
just
as
i
was
thinking
up
a
name
to
send
it
to
i
explained
hannah
that
mother
maid
you
know
brought
in
some
hot
milk
and
some
malted
milk
tablets
and
i
took
the
name
from
them
look
here
he
said
i
unprejudiced
and
quite
calm
but
is
the
maid
rather
piling
it
on
hannah
is
mother
maid
and
she
brought
in
the
milk
and
the
tablets
i
should
think
i
said
growing
sarcastic
that
so
far
it
is
clear
to
the
dullest
mind
go
on
he
said
leaning
back
and
closing
his
eyes
you
named
the
letter
for
your
mother
maid
i
mean
for
the
malted
milk
although
you
have
not
yet
stated
the
name
you
chose
i
never
heard
of
any
one
named
milk
and
as
to
the
other
while
i
have
known
some
rather
thoroughly
malted
people
however
let
that
go
valentine
tablets
i
said
of
course
you
understand
i
said
bending
forward
there
was
no
such
person
i
made
him
up
the
harold
was
made
up
too
harold
valentine
i
see
not
clearly
perhaps
but
i
have
a
gleam
of
intelligence
but
after
all
there
was
such
a
person
that
clear
is
it
and
now
he
considers
that
we
are
engaged
and
and
he
insists
on
marrying
me
that
he
said
is
really
easy
to
understand
i
do
blame
him
at
all
he
is
clearly
a
person
of
discernment
of
course
i
said
bitterly
you
would
be
on
his
side
every
one
is
but
the
point
is
this
he
went
on
if
you
made
him
up
out
of
the
whole
cloth
as
it
were
and
there
was
no
such
person
how
can
there
be
such
a
person
i
am
merely
asking
to
get
it
all
clear
in
my
head
it
sounds
so
reasonable
when
you
say
it
but
there
seems
to
be
something
left
out
i
do
know
how
he
can
be
but
he
is
i
said
hopelessly
and
he
is
exactly
like
his
picture
well
that
not
unusual
you
know
it
is
in
this
case
because
i
bought
the
picture
in
a
shop
and
just
pretended
it
was
him
he
and
it
was
he
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
it
a
very
strange
case
he
said
do
you
mind
if
i
light
a
cigarette
it
helps
to
clear
my
brain
what
was
the
name
you
gave
him
harold
valentine
but
he
is
here
under
another
name
because
of
my
family
they
think
i
am
a
mere
child
you
see
and
so
of
course
he
took
a
nom
de
plume
a
nom
de
plume
oh
i
see
what
is
it
grosvenor
i
said
the
same
as
yours
there
another
grosvenor
in
the
building
that
where
the
trouble
came
in
i
suppose
now
let
me
get
this
straight
you
wrote
a
letter
and
somehow
or
other
he
got
it
and
now
you
want
it
back
stripped
of
the
things
that
baffle
my
intelligence
that
it
is
it
i
rose
in
excitement
then
if
he
lives
in
the
building
the
letter
is
probably
here
why
ca
you
go
and
get
it
for
me
very
neat
and
let
you
slip
away
while
i
am
gone
i
saw
that
he
was
still
uncertain
that
i
was
telling
him
the
truth
it
was
maddening
and
only
the
letter
itself
could
convince
him
oh
please
try
to
get
it
i
cried
almost
weeping
you
can
lock
me
in
here
if
you
are
afraid
i
will
run
away
and
he
is
out
i
know
he
is
he
is
at
the
club
ball
naturally
he
said
the
fact
that
you
are
asking
me
to
compound
a
felony
commit
larceny
and
be
an
accessory
after
the
fact
does
not
trouble
you
as
i
told
you
before
all
i
have
left
is
my
good
name
and
now
please
i
said
he
stared
down
at
me
certainly
he
said
asked
in
that
tone
murder
would
be
one
of
the
easiest
things
i
do
but
i
shall
lock
you
in
very
well
i
said
meekly
and
after
i
had
described
it
the
letter
to
him
he
went
out
i
had
won
but
my
triumph
was
but
sackcloth
and
ashes
in
my
mouth
i
had
won
but
at
what
a
cost
ah
how
i
wished
that
i
might
live
again
the
past
few
days
that
i
might
never
have
started
on
my
path
of
deception
or
that
since
my
intentions
at
the
start
had
been
so
innocent
i
had
taken
another
photograph
at
the
shop
which
i
had
fancied
considerably
but
had
heartlessly
rejected
because
of
no
mustache
he
was
gone
for
a
long
time
and
i
sat
and
palpitated
for
what
if
had
returned
early
and
found
him
and
called
in
the
police
but
the
latter
had
not
occurred
for
at
ten
minutes
after
one
he
came
back
entering
by
the
window
from
a
and
much
streaked
with
dirt
narrow
escape
dear
child
he
observed
locking
the
window
and
drawing
the
shade
just
as
i
got
it
your
er
gentleman
friend
returned
and
fitted
his
key
in
the
lock
i
am
not
at
all
sure
he
said
wiping
his
hands
with
his
handkerchief
that
he
will
not
regard
the
open
window
as
a
suspicious
circumstance
he
may
be
of
a
low
turn
of
mind
however
all
well
that
ends
here
in
this
room
here
it
is
i
took
it
and
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
joy
i
was
saved
now
he
said
we
order
a
taxicab
and
get
you
home
and
while
it
is
coming
suppose
you
tell
me
the
thing
over
again
it
not
as
clear
to
me
as
it
ought
to
be
even
now
so
then
i
told
him
about
not
being
out
yet
and
sis
having
flowers
sent
her
and
her
room
done
over
and
never
getting
to
bed
until
dawn
and
that
they
treated
me
like
a
mere
child
which
was
the
reason
for
everything
and
about
the
poem
which
he
considered
quite
good
and
then
about
the
letter
i
get
the
whole
thing
a
bit
clearer
now
he
said
of
course
it
is
still
cloudy
in
places
the
making
up
somebody
to
write
to
is
understandable
under
the
circumstances
but
it
is
odd
to
have
had
the
very
person
materialize
so
to
speak
it
makes
me
wonder
well
how
about
burning
the
letter
now
we
got
it
it
would
be
better
i
think
the
way
things
have
been
going
with
you
if
we
do
destroy
it
it
is
likely
to
walk
off
into
somebody
else
pocket
and
cause
more
trouble
so
we
burned
it
and
then
the
telephone
rang
and
said
the
taxi
was
there
i
get
my
coat
and
be
ready
in
a
jiffy
he
said
and
maybe
we
can
smuggle
you
into
the
house
and
no
one
the
wiser
we
try
anyhow
he
went
into
the
other
room
and
i
sat
by
the
fire
and
thought
you
remember
that
when
i
was
planning
harold
valentine
i
had
imagined
him
with
a
small
dark
mustache
and
deep
passionate
eyes
well
this
grosvenor
had
both
or
rather
all
three
and
he
had
the
loveliest
smile
with
no
dimple
he
was
i
felt
exactly
the
sort
of
man
i
could
die
for
it
was
too
tragic
that
with
all
the
world
to
choose
from
i
had
not
taken
him
instead
of
we
walked
downstairs
so
as
not
to
give
the
elevator
boy
a
chance
to
talk
he
said
but
he
was
asleep
again
and
we
got
to
the
street
and
to
the
taxicab
without
being
seen
oh
i
was
very
cheerful
when
i
think
of
it
but
i
might
have
known
all
along
nothing
went
right
with
me
that
week
just
before
we
got
to
the
house
he
said
goodnight
and
goodbye
little
barbara
i
never
forget
you
and
this
evening
and
save
me
a
dance
at
your
party
i
be
there
i
held
out
my
hand
and
he
took
it
and
kissed
it
it
was
all
perfectly
thrilling
and
then
we
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
he
helped
me
out
and
my
entire
family
had
just
got
out
of
the
motor
and
was
lined
up
on
the
pavement
staring
at
us
all
right
are
you
he
said
as
coolly
as
if
they
had
not
been
anywhere
in
sight
well
good
night
and
good
luck
and
he
got
into
the
taxicab
and
drove
away
leaving
me
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
next
morning
i
was
sent
back
to
school
they
never
gave
me
a
chance
to
explain
for
mother
went
into
hysterics
after
accusing
me
of
having
men
dangling
around
waiting
at
every
corner
they
had
to
have
a
doctor
and
things
were
awful
the
only
person
who
said
anything
was
sis
she
came
to
my
room
that
night
when
i
was
in
bed
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
she
was
very
angry
but
there
was
a
sort
of
awe
in
her
eyes
my
hat
off
to
you
barbara
she
said
where
in
the
world
do
you
pick
them
all
up
things
must
have
changed
at
school
since
i
was
there
i
sick
to
death
of
the
other
sex
i
replied
languidly
it
no
punishment
to
send
me
away
i
need
a
little
piece
and
quiet
and
i
did
conclusion
all
this
holiday
week
while
the
girls
are
away
i
have
been
writing
this
theme
for
literature
class
is
new
years
and
i
am
putting
in
the
finishing
touches
i
intend
to
have
it
typed
in
the
village
and
to
send
a
copy
to
father
who
i
think
will
understand
and
another
copy
but
with
a
few
lines
cut
to
grosvenor
the
nice
one
there
were
some
things
he
did
not
quite
understand
and
this
will
explain
i
shall
also
send
a
copy
to
carter
brooks
who
came
out
handsomely
with
an
apology
this
morning
in
a
letter
and
a
ten
pound
box
of
candy
his
letter
explains
everything
is
a
real
person
and
did
not
come
out
of
a
cabinet
carter
recognized
the
photograph
as
being
one
of
a
grosvenor
he
went
to
college
with
who
had
gone
on
the
stage
and
was
playing
in
a
stock
company
at
home
only
they
were
not
playing
christmas
week
as
business
he
says
is
rotten
then
when
he
saw
me
writing
the
letter
he
felt
that
it
was
all
a
bluff
especially
as
he
had
seen
me
sending
myself
the
violets
at
the
florists
so
he
got
grosvenor
the
blonde
one
to
pretend
he
was
harold
valentine
only
things
slipped
up
i
quote
from
carter
letter
he
a
bully
chap
bab
and
he
went
into
it
for
a
lark
roses
and
poems
and
all
but
when
he
saw
that
you
took
it
rather
hard
he
felt
it
square
he
went
to
your
father
to
explain
and
apologized
but
your
father
seemed
to
think
you
needed
a
lesson
he
a
pretty
good
sport
your
father
and
he
said
to
let
it
go
on
for
a
day
or
two
a
little
worry
would
hurt
you
however
i
do
not
call
it
being
a
good
sport
to
see
one
daughter
perfectly
wretched
and
do
nothing
to
help
and
more
than
that
to
willfully
permit
one
child
to
suffer
and
enjoy
it
but
it
was
father
after
all
who
got
the
jolt
i
think
when
he
saw
me
get
out
of
the
taxicab
therefore
i
will
not
explain
for
a
time
a
little
worry
will
not
hurt
him
either
i
will
not
send
him
his
copy
for
a
week
perhaps
after
all
i
will
give
him
something
to
worry
about
eventually
for
i
have
received
a
box
of
roses
with
no
card
but
a
pen
and
ink
drawing
of
a
gentleman
in
evening
clothes
crawling
onto
a
through
an
open
window
he
has
dropped
his
heart
and
it
is
two
floors
below
my
narrative
has
now
come
to
a
conclusion
and
i
will
close
with
a
few
reflections
drawn
from
my
own
sad
and
tragic
experience
i
trust
the
girls
of
this
school
will
ponder
and
reflect
deception
is
a
very
sad
thing
it
starts
very
easy
and
without
warning
and
everything
seems
to
be
going
all
right
and
no
rocks
ahead
when
suddenly
the
breakers
loom
up
and
your
frail
vessel
sinks
with
you
on
board
and
maybe
your
dear
ones
dragged
down
with
you
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practice
to
deceive
sir
walter
scott
chapter
ii
theme
the
celebrity
we
have
been
requested
to
write
during
this
vacation
a
true
and
veracious
account
of
a
meeting
with
any
celebrity
we
happened
to
meet
during
the
summer
if
no
celebrity
any
interesting
character
would
do
excepting
one
own
family
but
as
one
own
family
is
neither
celebrated
nor
interesting
there
is
no
temptation
to
write
about
it
as
i
met
reginald
beecher
this
summer
i
have
chosen
him
as
my
subject
brief
history
of
the
subject
he
was
born
in
at
woodbury
j
attended
public
high
schools
and
in
graduated
from
princeton
university
following
year
produced
first
play
in
new
york
called
her
soul
followed
this
by
the
soul
mate
and
this
by
the
divorce
description
of
subject
beecher
is
tall
and
slender
and
wears
a
very
small
dark
mustache
although
but
years
of
age
his
hair
on
close
inspection
reveals
here
and
there
a
silver
thread
his
teeth
are
good
and
his
eyes
amber
with
small
flecks
of
brown
in
them
he
has
been
vaccinated
twice
it
has
always
been
one
of
my
chief
ambitions
to
meet
a
celebrity
on
one
or
two
occasions
we
have
had
them
at
school
but
they
never
sit
at
the
junior
table
also
they
are
seldom
connected
with
either
the
drama
or
the
movies
a
slang
term
but
apparently
taking
a
place
in
our
literature
it
was
my
intention
on
being
given
this
subject
for
my
midsummer
theme
to
seek
out
bainbridge
a
lady
author
who
has
a
cottage
across
the
bay
from
ours
and
to
ask
the
privilege
of
sitting
at
her
feet
for
a
few
hours
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
and
learning
from
her
own
lips
her
favorite
flower
her
favorite
poem
and
the
favorite
child
of
her
brain
of
all
those
arts
in
which
the
wise
excel
nature
chief
masterpiece
is
writing
well
duke
of
buckingham
i
had
meant
to
write
my
theme
on
her
but
i
learned
in
time
that
she
was
forty
years
of
age
her
work
is
therefore
done
she
has
passed
her
active
years
and
i
consider
that
it
is
not
the
past
of
american
letters
which
is
at
stake
but
the
future
besides
i
was
more
interested
in
the
drama
than
in
literature
possibly
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
girls
think
i
resemble
julia
marlowe
that
from
my
earliest
years
my
mind
has
been
turned
toward
the
stage
i
am
very
determined
and
fixed
in
my
ways
and
with
me
to
decide
to
do
a
thing
is
to
decide
to
do
it
i
am
not
of
a
romantic
nature
however
and
as
i
learned
of
the
dangers
of
the
theater
i
drew
back
even
a
strong
nature
such
as
mine
is
on
occasions
can
be
influenced
i
therefore
decided
to
change
my
plans
and
to
write
plays
instead
of
acting
in
them
at
first
i
meant
to
write
comedies
but
as
i
realized
the
gravity
of
life
and
its
bitterness
and
disappointments
i
turned
naturally
to
tragedy
surely
as
dear
shakespeare
says
the
world
is
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
this
explains
my
sincere
interest
in
beecher
his
works
were
all
realistic
and
sad
i
remember
that
i
saw
the
first
one
three
years
ago
when
a
mere
child
and
became
violently
ill
from
crying
and
had
to
be
taken
home
the
school
will
recall
that
last
year
i
wrote
a
play
patterned
on
the
divorce
and
that
only
a
certain
narrowness
of
view
on
the
part
of
the
faculty
prevented
it
being
the
class
play
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
express
an
opinion
we
of
the
class
of
are
not
children
and
should
not
be
treated
as
such
encouraged
by
the
applause
of
my
and
feeling
that
i
was
of
a
more
serious
turn
of
mind
than
most
of
them
who
seem
to
think
of
pleasure
only
i
decided
to
write
a
play
during
the
summer
i
would
thus
be
improving
my
vacation
hours
and
i
considered
keeping
out
of
mischief
it
was
pure
idleness
which
had
caused
my
trouble
during
the
last
christmas
holidays
how
true
it
is
that
the
devil
finds
work
for
idle
hands
with
a
play
and
this
theme
i
believed
that
the
devil
would
give
me
up
as
a
total
loss
and
go
elsewhere
how
little
we
can
read
the
future
i
now
proceed
to
an
account
of
my
meeting
and
acquaintance
with
beecher
it
is
my
intention
to
conceal
nothing
i
can
only
comfort
myself
with
the
thought
that
my
motives
were
innocent
and
that
i
was
obeying
orders
and
securing
material
for
a
theme
i
consider
that
the
attitude
of
my
family
is
wrong
and
cruel
and
that
my
sister
leila
being
only
months
older
although
out
in
society
has
no
need
to
write
me
the
sort
of
letters
she
has
been
writing
twenty
months
is
twenty
months
and
not
two
years
although
she
seems
to
think
it
is
i
returned
home
full
of
happy
plans
for
my
vacation
when
i
look
back
it
seems
strange
that
the
gay
and
innocent
young
girl
of
the
train
can
have
been
so
much
that
is
tragic
has
since
happened
if
i
had
not
had
a
cinder
in
my
eye
things
would
have
been
different
but
why
repine
fate
frequently
hangs
thus
on
a
single
hair
an
as
one
may
say
father
met
me
at
the
train
i
had
got
the
aforementioned
cinder
in
my
eye
and
a
very
nice
young
man
had
taken
it
out
for
me
i
still
can
not
see
what
harm
there
was
in
our
chatting
together
after
that
especially
as
we
said
nothing
to
object
to
but
father
looked
very
disagreeable
about
it
and
the
young
man
went
away
in
a
hurry
but
it
started
us
off
wrong
although
i
got
him
father
to
promise
not
to
tell
mother
i
do
wish
you
would
be
more
careful
bab
he
said
with
a
sort
of
sigh
careful
i
said
then
it
not
doing
things
but
being
found
out
that
matters
careful
in
your
conduct
bab
he
was
a
beautiful
young
man
father
i
observed
slipping
my
arm
through
his
barbara
barbara
your
poor
mother
now
look
here
father
i
said
if
it
was
mother
who
was
interested
in
him
it
might
be
troublesome
but
it
is
only
me
and
i
warn
you
here
and
now
that
i
expect
to
be
thrilled
at
the
sight
of
a
nice
young
man
right
along
it
goes
up
my
back
and
out
the
roots
of
my
hair
well
my
father
is
a
real
person
so
he
told
me
to
talk
sense
and
gave
me
twenty
dollars
and
agreed
to
say
nothing
about
the
young
man
to
mother
if
i
would
root
for
canada
against
the
adirondacks
for
the
summer
because
of
the
fishing
mother
was
waiting
in
the
hall
for
me
but
she
held
me
off
with
both
hands
not
until
you
have
bathed
and
changed
your
clothing
barbara
she
said
i
have
never
had
it
she
meant
the
whooping
cough
the
school
will
recall
the
epidemic
which
ravaged
us
last
june
and
changed
us
from
a
peaceful
institution
to
what
sounded
like
a
dog
show
well
i
got
the
same
old
room
not
much
fixed
up
but
they
had
put
up
different
curtains
anyhow
thank
goodness
i
had
been
hinting
all
spring
for
new
furniture
but
my
family
does
not
take
a
hint
unless
it
is
chloroformed
first
and
i
found
the
same
old
stuff
there
they
believe
in
waiting
until
a
girl
makes
her
debut
before
giving
her
anything
but
the
necessities
of
life
sis
was
off
for
a
but
hannah
was
there
and
i
kissed
her
not
that
i
so
fond
of
her
but
i
had
to
kiss
somebody
well
miss
barbara
she
said
how
you
grown
that
made
me
rather
sore
because
i
am
not
a
child
any
longer
but
they
all
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
but
six
years
old
and
small
for
my
age
i
stopped
growing
hannah
i
said
with
dignity
at
least
almost
but
i
see
i
still
draw
the
nursery
hannah
was
opening
my
suitcase
and
she
looked
up
and
said
i
tried
to
get
you
the
blue
room
miss
bab
but
miss
leila
said
she
needed
it
for
house
parties
never
mind
i
said
i
do
care
anything
about
furniture
i
have
other
things
to
think
about
hannah
i
want
the
school
room
desk
up
here
desk
she
said
with
her
jaw
drooping
i
am
writing
now
i
said
i
need
a
lot
of
ink
and
paper
and
a
good
lamp
let
them
keep
the
blue
room
hannah
for
their
selfish
purposes
i
shall
be
happy
in
my
work
i
need
nothing
more
writing
said
hannah
is
it
a
book
you
writing
a
play
listen
to
the
child
a
play
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
listen
hannah
i
said
it
is
not
what
is
outside
of
us
that
matters
it
is
what
is
inside
it
is
what
we
are
not
what
we
eat
or
look
like
or
wear
i
have
given
up
everything
hannah
to
my
career
you
young
yet
said
hannah
you
used
to
be
fond
enough
of
the
boys
hannah
has
been
with
us
for
years
so
she
gets
rather
talky
at
times
and
has
to
be
sat
upon
i
care
nothing
whatever
for
the
other
sex
i
replied
haughtily
she
was
opening
my
suitcase
at
the
time
and
i
was
surveying
the
chamber
which
was
to
be
the
seen
of
my
literary
life
at
least
for
some
time
now
and
then
i
said
to
hannah
i
shall
read
you
parts
of
it
only
you
must
run
and
tell
mother
why
not
said
she
peering
into
the
suitcase
because
i
intend
to
deal
with
life
i
said
i
shall
deal
with
real
things
and
not
the
way
we
think
them
i
am
young
but
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
i
shall
mince
nothing
look
here
miss
barbara
hannah
said
all
at
once
what
are
you
doing
with
this
whiskey
flask
and
these
socks
and
you
come
right
here
and
tell
me
where
you
got
the
things
in
this
suitcase
i
stocked
over
to
the
bed
and
my
blood
froze
in
my
veins
it
was
not
mine
words
can
not
fully
express
how
i
felt
while
fully
convinced
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
i
knew
not
when
or
how
hannah
was
staring
at
me
with
cold
and
accusing
eyes
you
a
very
young
lady
miss
barbara
she
said
with
her
eyes
full
of
suspicion
to
be
carrying
a
flask
about
with
you
i
was
as
puzzled
as
she
was
but
i
remained
calm
and
to
all
appearances
spartan
i
am
young
in
years
i
remarked
but
i
have
seen
life
hannah
now
i
meant
nothing
by
this
at
the
time
but
it
was
getting
on
my
nerves
to
be
put
in
the
infant
class
all
the
time
the
christmas
before
they
had
done
it
and
i
had
had
my
revenge
although
it
had
hurt
me
more
than
it
hurt
them
and
if
i
gave
them
a
fright
i
gave
myself
a
worse
one
as
i
said
at
that
time
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practice
to
deceive
sir
walter
scott
hannah
gave
me
a
horrified
glare
and
dipped
into
the
suitcase
again
she
brought
up
a
tin
box
of
cigarettes
and
i
thought
she
was
going
to
have
delirium
tremens
at
once
well
at
first
i
thought
the
girls
at
school
had
played
a
trick
on
me
and
a
low
down
mean
trick
at
that
there
are
always
those
who
think
it
is
funny
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
but
they
are
the
first
to
squeal
when
anything
is
done
to
them
once
i
put
a
small
garter
snake
in
a
muff
and
it
went
up
her
sleeve
which
is
nothing
to
some
of
the
things
she
had
done
to
me
and
you
would
have
thought
the
school
was
on
fire
anyhow
i
said
to
myself
that
some
smarty
was
trying
to
get
me
into
trouble
and
hannah
would
run
to
the
family
and
they
never
believe
me
all
at
once
i
saw
all
my
cherished
plans
for
the
summer
gone
and
me
in
the
country
somewhere
with
mademoiselle
and
walking
through
the
pasture
with
a
botany
in
one
hand
and
a
folding
cup
in
the
other
in
case
we
found
a
spring
a
cow
had
not
stepped
in
mademoiselle
was
once
my
governess
but
has
retired
to
private
life
except
in
cases
of
emergency
i
am
naturally
very
quick
in
mind
the
archibalds
are
all
like
that
and
when
once
we
decide
on
a
course
we
stick
to
it
through
thick
and
thin
but
we
do
not
lie
it
is
ridiculous
for
hannah
to
say
i
said
the
cigarettes
were
mine
all
i
said
was
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
tell
the
family
you
better
run
or
you
burst
oh
miss
barbara
miss
barbara
she
said
and
you
so
young
to
be
so
wild
this
was
unjust
and
i
am
one
to
resent
injustice
i
had
returned
home
with
my
mind
fixed
on
serious
things
and
now
i
was
being
told
i
was
wild
if
i
tell
your
mother
she
have
a
fit
hannah
said
evidently
drawn
hither
and
thither
by
emotion
now
see
here
miss
bab
you
just
come
home
and
there
was
trouble
at
your
last
vacation
that
i
like
to
remember
to
my
dying
day
you
tell
me
how
those
things
got
there
like
a
good
girl
and
i
say
nothing
about
them
i
am
naturally
sweet
in
disposition
but
to
call
me
a
good
girl
and
remind
me
of
last
christmas
holidays
was
too
much
my
natural
firmness
came
to
the
front
certainly
not
i
said
you
need
stick
your
lip
out
at
me
miss
bab
that
was
only
giving
you
a
chance
and
forgetting
my
duty
to
help
you
not
to
mention
probably
losing
my
place
when
the
family
finds
out
finds
out
what
what
you
been
up
to
the
stage
and
writing
plays
and
now
liquor
and
tobacco
now
i
may
be
at
fault
in
the
narrative
that
follows
but
i
ask
the
school
if
this
was
fair
treatment
i
had
returned
to
my
home
full
of
high
ideals
only
to
see
them
crushed
beneath
the
heal
of
domestic
tyranny
necessity
is
the
argument
of
tyrants
it
is
the
creed
of
slaves
william
pitt
how
true
are
these
immortal
words
it
was
with
a
firm
countenance
but
a
sinking
heart
that
i
saw
hannah
leave
the
room
i
had
come
home
inspired
with
lofty
ambition
and
it
had
ended
thus
i
wandered
to
the
bedside
and
let
my
eyes
fall
on
the
suitcase
the
container
of
all
my
woe
well
i
was
surprised
all
right
it
was
not
and
never
had
been
mine
instead
of
my
blue
serge
sailor
suit
and
my
de
nuit
and
kimono
it
contained
a
checked
gentleman
suit
a
mussed
shirt
and
a
cap
at
first
i
was
merely
astonished
then
a
sense
of
loss
overpowered
me
i
suffered
i
was
prostrated
with
grief
not
that
i
cared
a
rap
for
the
clothes
i
lost
being
most
of
them
to
small
and
patched
here
and
there
but
i
had
lost
the
plot
of
my
play
my
career
was
gone
i
was
undone
it
may
be
asked
what
has
this
recital
to
do
with
the
account
of
meeting
a
celebrity
i
reply
that
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
a
bare
recital
of
a
meeting
may
be
news
but
it
is
not
art
a
theme
consists
of
introduction
body
and
conclusion
this
is
still
the
introduction
when
i
was
at
last
revived
enough
to
think
i
knew
what
had
happened
the
young
man
who
took
the
cinder
out
of
my
eye
had
come
to
sit
beside
me
which
i
consider
was
merely
kindness
on
his
part
and
nothing
like
flirting
and
he
had
brought
his
suitcase
over
and
they
had
got
mixed
up
but
i
knew
the
family
would
call
it
flirting
and
not
listen
to
a
word
i
said
a
madness
seized
me
now
that
everything
is
over
i
realize
that
it
was
madness
but
there
is
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
etc
it
was
to
be
it
was
karma
or
kismet
or
whatever
the
word
is
it
was
written
in
the
book
of
fate
that
i
was
to
go
ahead
and
wreck
my
life
and
generally
ruin
everything
i
locked
the
door
behind
hannah
and
stood
with
tragic
feet
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
what
was
i
to
do
how
hide
this
evidence
of
my
presumed
duplicity
i
was
innocent
but
i
looked
guilty
this
as
everyone
knows
is
worse
than
guilt
i
unpacked
the
suitcase
as
fast
as
i
could
therefore
and
being
just
about
distracted
i
bundled
the
things
up
and
put
them
all
together
in
the
toy
closet
where
all
sis
dolls
and
mine
are
mine
being
mostly
pretty
badly
gone
as
i
was
always
hard
on
dolls
how
far
removed
were
those
innocent
years
when
i
played
with
dolls
well
i
knew
hannah
pretty
well
and
therefore
was
not
surprised
when
having
hidden
the
trousers
under
a
doll
buggy
i
heard
mother
voice
at
the
door
let
me
in
barbara
she
said
i
closed
the
closet
door
and
said
what
is
it
mother
let
me
in
so
i
let
her
in
and
pretended
i
expected
her
to
kiss
me
which
she
had
not
yet
on
account
of
the
whooping
cough
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
also
the
kiss
barbara
she
said
in
the
meanest
voice
how
long
have
you
been
smoking
now
i
must
pause
to
explain
this
had
mother
approached
me
in
a
sweet
and
maternal
manner
i
would
have
been
softened
and
would
have
told
the
whole
story
but
she
did
not
she
was
as
you
might
say
steaming
with
rage
and
seeing
that
i
was
misunderstood
i
hardened
i
can
be
as
hard
as
adamant
when
necessary
what
do
you
mean
mother
do
answer
one
question
with
another
how
can
i
answer
when
i
do
understand
you
she
simply
twitched
with
fury
you
a
mere
child
she
raved
and
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
mention
it
the
idea
of
your
owning
a
flask
and
bringing
it
into
this
house
it
is
it
is
well
i
was
growing
cold
and
more
haughty
every
moment
so
i
said
i
do
see
why
the
mere
mention
of
a
flask
upsets
you
so
it
because
you
are
used
to
one
especially
when
traveling
and
since
i
was
a
mere
baby
i
have
been
accustomed
to
intoxicants
barbara
she
interjected
in
the
most
dreadful
tone
i
mean
in
the
family
i
said
i
have
seen
wine
on
our
table
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
knew
to
put
salt
on
a
claret
stain
before
i
could
talk
well
you
know
how
it
is
to
see
an
enemy
on
the
run
and
although
i
regret
to
refer
to
my
dear
mother
as
an
enemy
still
at
that
moment
she
was
such
and
no
less
and
she
was
beating
it
it
was
the
reference
to
my
youth
that
had
aroused
me
and
i
was
like
a
wounded
lion
besides
i
knew
well
enough
that
if
they
refused
to
see
that
i
was
practically
grown
up
if
not
entirely
i
would
get
a
lot
of
sis
clothes
fixed
up
with
new
ribbons
faded
old
things
i
had
them
for
years
better
to
be
considered
a
bad
woman
than
an
unformed
child
however
mother
i
finished
if
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
i
did
not
buy
that
flask
and
i
am
not
a
confirmed
alcoholic
by
no
means
this
settles
it
she
said
in
a
melancholy
tone
when
i
think
of
the
comfort
leila
has
been
to
me
and
the
anxiety
you
have
caused
i
wonder
where
you
get
your
your
deviltry
from
i
am
positively
faint
i
was
alarmed
for
she
did
look
queer
with
her
face
all
white
around
the
rouge
so
i
reached
for
the
flask
i
give
you
a
swig
of
this
i
said
it
will
pull
you
around
in
no
time
but
she
held
me
off
fiercely
never
she
said
never
again
i
shall
empty
the
wine
cellar
there
will
be
nothing
to
drink
in
this
house
from
now
on
i
do
not
know
what
we
are
coming
to
she
walked
into
the
bathroom
and
i
heard
her
emptying
the
flask
down
the
drain
pipe
it
was
a
very
handsome
flask
silver
with
gold
stripes
and
all
at
once
i
knew
the
young
man
would
want
it
back
so
i
said
mother
please
leave
the
flask
here
anyhow
certainly
not
it
not
mine
mother
whose
is
it
it
a
friend
of
mine
loaned
it
to
me
who
i
ca
tell
you
you
ca
tell
me
barbara
i
am
utterly
bewildered
i
sent
you
away
a
simple
child
and
you
return
to
me
what
well
we
had
about
an
hour
fight
over
it
and
we
ended
in
a
compromise
i
gave
up
the
flask
and
promised
not
to
smoke
and
so
forth
and
i
was
to
have
some
new
dresses
and
a
silk
sweater
and
to
be
allowed
to
stay
up
until
ten
and
to
have
a
desk
in
my
room
for
my
work
work
mother
said
career
what
next
why
ca
you
be
like
leila
and
settle
down
to
having
a
good
time
leila
and
i
are
different
i
said
loftily
for
i
resented
her
tone
leila
is
a
child
of
the
moment
life
for
her
is
one
grand
sweet
song
for
me
it
is
a
serious
matter
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
the
grave
is
not
its
goal
i
quoted
in
impassioned
tones
because
that
is
the
way
i
feel
how
can
the
grave
be
its
goal
there
must
be
something
beyond
i
have
thought
it
all
out
and
i
believe
in
a
world
beyond
but
not
in
a
hell
hell
i
believe
is
the
state
of
mind
one
gets
into
in
this
world
as
a
result
of
one
wicked
acts
or
wicked
thoughts
and
is
in
one
self
as
i
have
said
the
other
side
of
the
compromise
was
that
i
was
not
to
carry
flasks
with
me
or
drink
any
punch
at
parties
if
it
had
a
stick
in
it
and
you
can
generally
find
out
by
the
taste
for
if
it
is
what
carter
brooks
calls
loaded
it
stings
your
tongue
or
if
it
tastes
like
cider
it
probably
champagne
and
i
was
not
to
smoke
any
cigarettes
mother
was
holding
out
on
the
sweater
at
that
time
saying
that
sis
had
a
perfectly
good
one
from
miami
and
why
not
wear
that
so
i
put
up
a
strong
protest
about
the
cigarettes
although
i
have
never
smoked
but
once
as
i
think
the
school
knows
and
that
only
half
through
owing
to
getting
dizzy
i
said
that
sis
smoked
now
and
then
because
she
thought
it
looked
smart
but
that
if
i
was
to
have
a
career
i
felt
that
the
soothing
influence
of
tobacco
would
help
a
lot
so
i
got
the
new
sweater
and
everything
looked
smooth
again
and
mother
kissed
me
on
the
way
out
and
said
she
had
not
meant
to
be
harsh
but
that
my
great
uncle
putnam
had
been
a
notorious
drunkard
and
i
looked
like
him
although
of
a
more
refined
type
there
was
a
dreadful
row
that
night
however
when
father
came
home
we
were
all
dressed
for
dinner
and
waiting
in
the
drawing
room
and
leila
was
complaining
about
me
as
usual
she
looks
older
than
i
do
now
mother
she
said
if
she
goes
to
the
seashore
with
us
i
have
her
always
tagging
at
my
heals
i
do
see
why
i
ca
have
my
first
summer
in
peace
oh
yes
we
were
going
to
the
shore
after
all
sis
wanted
it
and
everybody
does
what
she
wants
regardless
of
what
they
prefer
even
fishing
first
summer
i
exclaimed
one
would
think
you
were
a
teething
baby
i
was
speaking
to
mother
barbara
everyone
knows
that
a
debutante
only
has
one
year
nowadays
and
if
she
does
go
off
in
that
year
swept
away
by
the
flood
of
new
girls
the
next
fall
we
might
as
well
be
frank
and
while
barbara
not
a
beauty
as
soon
as
the
bones
in
her
neck
get
a
little
flesh
on
them
she
wo
be
hopeless
and
she
has
a
flippant
manner
that
men
like
i
intend
to
keep
barbara
under
my
eyes
this
summer
mother
said
firmly
after
last
christmas
happenings
and
our
discovery
today
i
shall
keep
her
with
me
she
need
not
however
interfere
with
you
leila
her
hours
are
mostly
different
and
i
will
see
that
her
friends
are
the
younger
boys
i
said
nothing
but
i
knew
perfectly
well
she
had
in
mind
eddie
perkins
and
willie
graham
and
a
lot
of
other
little
kids
that
hang
around
the
fruit
punch
at
parties
and
throw
the
peas
from
the
croquettes
at
each
other
when
the
footmen
are
not
near
and
pretend
they
are
allowed
to
smoke
but
have
sworn
off
for
the
summer
i
was
naturally
indignant
at
sis
words
which
were
not
filial
to
my
mind
but
i
replied
as
sweetly
as
possible
i
shall
not
be
in
your
way
leila
i
ask
nothing
but
food
and
shelter
and
that
perhaps
not
for
long
why
do
you
intend
to
die
she
demanded
i
intend
to
work
i
said
it
more
interesting
than
dieing
and
will
be
a
novelty
in
this
house
father
came
in
just
then
and
he
said
i
not
wait
to
dress
clara
hello
children
i
just
change
my
collar
while
you
ring
for
the
cocktails
mother
got
up
and
faced
him
with
majesty
we
are
not
going
to
have
any
she
said
any
what
said
father
from
the
doorway
i
have
had
some
fruit
juice
prepared
with
a
dash
of
bitters
it
is
quite
nice
and
i
ask
you
james
not
to
explode
before
the
servants
i
will
explain
later
father
has
a
very
nice
disposition
but
i
could
see
that
mother
manner
got
on
his
nerves
as
it
got
on
mine
anyhow
there
was
a
terrific
fuss
with
sis
playing
the
piano
so
that
the
servants
would
not
hear
and
in
the
end
father
had
a
cocktail
mother
waited
until
he
had
had
it
and
was
quieter
and
then
she
told
him
about
me
and
my
having
a
flask
in
my
suitcase
of
course
i
could
have
explained
but
if
they
persisted
in
misunderstanding
me
why
not
let
them
do
so
and
be
miserable
it
a
very
strange
thing
bab
he
said
looking
at
me
that
everything
in
this
house
is
quiet
until
you
come
home
and
then
we
get
as
lively
as
kittens
in
a
frying
pan
we
have
to
marry
you
off
pretty
soon
to
save
our
piece
of
mind
james
said
my
mother
remember
last
winter
please
there
was
no
claret
or
anything
with
dinner
and
father
ordered
mineral
water
and
criticized
the
food
and
fussed
about
sis
bill
and
the
second
man
gave
notice
immediately
after
we
left
the
dining
room
when
mother
reported
that
as
we
were
having
coffee
in
the
drawing
room
father
said
humph
well
what
can
you
expect
those
fellows
have
been
getting
the
best
half
of
a
bottle
of
claret
every
night
since
they
been
here
and
now
it
cut
off
damned
if
i
would
like
to
leave
myself
from
that
time
on
i
knew
that
i
was
watched
it
made
little
or
no
difference
to
me
i
had
my
work
and
it
filled
my
life
there
were
times
when
my
soul
was
so
filled
with
joy
that
i
could
hardly
bare
it
i
had
one
act
done
in
two
days
i
wrote
out
the
love
scenes
in
full
because
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
what
they
would
say
to
each
other
how
i
thrilled
as
each
marvelous
burst
of
fantasy
flowed
from
my
pen
but
the
dialogue
of
less
interesting
parts
i
left
for
the
actors
to
fill
in
themselves
i
consider
this
the
best
way
as
it
gives
them
a
chance
to
be
original
and
not
to
have
to
say
the
same
thing
over
and
over
jane
raleigh
came
over
to
see
me
the
day
after
i
came
home
and
i
read
her
some
of
the
love
scenes
she
positively
wept
with
excitement
bab
she
said
if
any
man
no
matter
who
ever
said
those
things
to
me
i
go
straight
into
his
arms
i
could
help
it
whose
going
to
act
in
it
i
think
i
have
robert
edeson
or
richard
mansfield
mansfield
dead
said
jane
honestly
honest
he
is
why
do
you
get
some
of
these
moving
picture
actors
they
never
have
a
chance
in
the
movies
only
acting
and
not
talking
well
that
sounded
logical
and
then
i
read
her
the
place
where
the
cruel
first
husband
comes
back
and
finds
her
married
again
and
happy
and
takes
the
children
out
to
drown
them
only
he
ca
because
they
can
swim
and
they
pull
him
in
instead
the
curtain
goes
down
on
nothing
but
a
few
bubbles
rising
to
mark
his
watery
grave
jane
was
crying
it
is
too
touching
for
words
bab
she
said
it
has
broken
my
heart
i
can
just
close
my
eyes
and
see
the
theater
dark
and
the
stage
almost
dark
and
just
those
bubbles
coming
up
and
breaking
would
you
have
to
have
a
tank
i
daresay
i
replied
dreamily
let
the
other
people
worry
about
that
i
can
only
give
them
the
material
and
hope
that
they
have
intelligence
enough
to
grasp
it
i
think
sis
must
have
told
carter
brooks
something
about
the
trouble
i
was
in
for
he
brought
me
a
box
of
candy
one
afternoon
and
winked
at
me
when
mother
was
not
looking
do
open
it
here
he
whispered
so
i
was
forced
to
control
my
impatience
though
passionately
fond
of
candy
and
when
i
got
to
my
room
later
the
box
was
full
of
cigarettes
i
could
have
screamed
it
just
gave
me
one
more
thing
to
hide
as
if
a
man
suit
and
shirt
and
so
on
was
not
sufficient
but
carter
paid
more
attention
to
me
than
he
ever
had
before
and
at
a
tea
dance
somebody
had
at
the
country
club
he
took
me
to
one
side
and
gave
me
a
good
talking
to
you
being
rather
a
bad
child
are
you
he
said
certainly
not
well
not
bad
but
er
naughty
now
see
here
bab
i
fond
of
you
and
you
growing
into
a
mighty
pretty
girl
but
your
whole
social
life
is
at
stake
for
heaven
sake
at
least
until
you
married
cut
out
the
cigarettes
and
booze
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
but
what
could
i
say
well
july
came
and
we
had
rented
a
house
at
little
hampton
and
everywhere
one
went
one
fell
over
an
open
trunk
or
a
barrel
containing
silver
or
linen
mother
went
around
with
her
lips
moving
as
if
in
prayer
but
she
was
really
repeating
lists
such
as
sowing
basket
table
candles
headache
tablets
black
silk
stockings
and
tennis
rackets
sis
got
some
lovely
clothes
mostly
imported
but
they
had
a
woman
come
in
and
sew
for
me
hannah
and
she
used
to
interrupt
my
most
precious
moments
at
my
desk
by
running
a
tape
measure
around
me
or
pinning
a
paper
pattern
to
me
the
sewing
woman
always
had
her
mouth
full
of
pins
and
once
owing
to
my
remarking
that
i
wished
i
had
been
illegitimate
so
i
could
go
away
and
live
my
own
life
she
swallowed
one
it
caused
a
grate
deal
of
excitement
with
hannah
blaming
me
and
giving
her
vinegar
to
swallow
to
soften
the
pin
well
it
turned
out
all
right
for
she
kept
on
living
but
she
pretended
to
have
sharp
pains
all
over
her
here
and
there
and
if
the
pin
had
been
as
lively
as
a
tadpole
and
wriggled
from
spot
to
spot
it
could
not
have
hurt
in
so
many
places
of
course
they
blamed
me
and
i
shut
myself
up
more
and
more
in
my
sanctuary
there
i
lived
with
the
creatures
of
my
dreams
and
forgot
for
a
while
that
i
was
only
a
and
that
leila
last
year
tennis
clothes
were
being
fixed
over
for
me
but
how
true
what
dear
shakespeare
says
are
the
children
of
an
idle
brain
of
nothing
but
vain
i
loved
my
dreams
but
alas
they
were
not
enough
after
a
tortured
hour
or
two
at
my
desk
living
in
myself
the
agonies
of
my
characters
suffering
the
pangs
of
the
wife
with
two
husbands
and
both
living
struggling
in
the
water
with
the
children
fruit
of
the
first
union
dying
with
number
two
and
blowing
my
last
bubbles
heavenward
after
all
these
emotions
i
was
done
out
jane
came
in
one
day
and
found
me
prostrate
on
my
couch
with
a
light
of
suffering
in
my
eyes
dearest
cried
jane
and
gliding
to
my
side
fell
on
her
knees
jane
what
is
it
you
are
ill
i
could
hardly
more
than
whisper
in
a
low
tone
i
said
he
is
dead
dearest
drowned
at
first
she
thought
i
meant
a
member
of
my
family
but
when
she
understood
she
looked
serious
you
are
too
intense
bab
she
said
solemnly
you
suffer
too
much
you
are
wearing
yourself
out
there
is
no
other
way
i
replied
in
broken
tones
jane
went
to
the
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
then
she
turned
to
me
others
do
do
it
i
must
work
out
my
own
salvation
jane
i
observed
firmly
but
she
had
roused
me
from
my
apathy
and
i
went
into
sis
room
returning
with
a
box
of
candy
some
one
had
sent
her
i
must
feel
jane
or
i
can
not
write
pooh
loads
of
writers
get
fat
on
it
why
do
you
try
comedy
it
pays
well
oh
money
i
said
in
a
disgusted
tone
your
forte
of
course
is
love
she
said
probably
that
because
you
had
so
much
experience
owing
to
certain
reasons
it
is
generally
supposed
that
i
have
experienced
the
gentle
passion
but
not
so
alas
bab
jane
said
suddenly
i
have
been
your
friend
for
a
long
time
i
have
never
betrayed
you
you
can
trust
me
with
your
life
why
do
you
tell
me
tell
you
what
something
has
happened
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
no
girl
who
is
happy
and
has
not
a
tragic
story
stays
at
home
shut
up
at
a
messy
desk
when
everyone
is
out
at
the
club
playing
tennis
do
talk
to
me
about
a
career
a
girl
career
is
a
man
and
nothing
else
and
especially
after
last
winter
bab
is
is
it
the
same
one
here
i
made
my
fatal
error
i
should
have
said
at
once
that
there
was
no
one
just
as
there
had
been
no
one
last
winter
but
she
looked
so
intense
sitting
there
and
after
all
why
should
i
not
have
an
amorous
experience
i
am
not
ugly
and
can
dance
well
although
inclined
to
lead
because
of
dancing
with
other
girls
all
winter
at
school
so
i
lay
back
on
my
pillow
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
no
it
is
not
the
same
man
what
is
he
like
bab
i
so
excited
i
ca
sit
still
it
it
hurts
to
talk
about
him
i
observed
faintly
now
i
intended
to
let
it
go
at
that
and
should
have
had
not
jane
kept
on
asking
questions
because
i
had
had
a
good
lesson
the
winter
before
and
did
not
intend
to
deceive
again
and
this
i
will
say
i
really
told
jane
raleigh
nothing
she
jumped
to
her
own
conclusions
and
as
for
her
people
saying
she
can
not
chum
with
me
any
more
i
will
only
say
this
if
jane
raleigh
smokes
she
did
not
learn
it
from
me
well
i
had
gone
as
far
as
i
meant
to
i
was
not
really
in
love
with
anyone
although
i
liked
carter
brooks
and
would
possibly
have
loved
him
with
all
the
depth
of
my
nature
if
sis
had
not
kept
an
eye
on
me
most
of
the
time
however
jane
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
and
i
tried
to
think
of
some
way
to
satisfy
her
and
not
make
any
trouble
and
then
i
thought
of
the
suitcase
so
i
locked
the
door
and
made
her
promise
not
to
tell
and
got
the
whole
thing
out
of
the
toy
closet
wha
what
is
it
asked
jane
i
said
nothing
but
opened
it
all
up
the
flask
was
gone
but
the
rest
was
there
and
carter
box
too
jane
leaned
down
and
lifted
the
trousers
and
poked
around
somewhat
then
she
straitened
and
said
you
have
run
away
and
got
married
bab
jane
she
looked
at
me
piercingly
do
lie
to
me
she
said
accusingly
or
else
what
are
you
doing
with
a
man
whole
outfit
including
his
dirty
collar
bab
i
just
ca
bare
it
well
i
saw
that
i
had
gone
to
far
and
was
about
to
tell
jane
the
truth
when
i
heard
the
sewing
woman
in
the
hall
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
get
the
things
put
away
and
with
jane
looking
like
death
i
had
to
stand
there
and
be
fitted
for
one
of
sis
chiffon
frocks
with
the
low
neck
filled
in
with
net
you
must
remember
miss
bab
said
the
human
pin
cushion
that
you
are
still
a
very
young
girl
and
not
out
yet
jane
got
up
off
the
bed
suddenly
i
i
guess
i
go
bab
she
said
i
do
feel
very
well
as
she
went
out
she
stopped
in
the
doorway
and
crossed
her
heart
meaning
that
she
would
die
before
she
would
tell
anything
but
i
was
not
comfortable
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thought
that
your
best
friend
considers
you
married
and
gone
beyond
recall
when
in
truth
you
are
not
or
even
thinking
about
it
except
in
idle
moments
the
seen
now
changes
life
is
nothing
but
such
changes
no
sooner
do
we
alight
on
one
branch
and
begin
to
sip
the
honey
from
it
but
we
are
taken
up
and
carried
elsewhere
perhaps
to
the
mountains
or
to
the
and
there
left
to
make
new
friends
and
find
new
methods
of
enjoyment
the
flight
or
journey
was
in
itself
an
anxious
time
for
on
my
otherwise
clear
conscience
rested
the
weight
of
that
strange
suitcase
fortunately
hannah
was
so
busy
that
i
was
left
to
pack
my
belongings
myself
and
thus
for
a
time
my
guilty
secret
was
safe
i
put
my
things
in
on
top
of
the
masculine
articles
not
daring
to
leave
any
of
them
in
the
closet
owing
to
which
is
always
done
before
our
return
in
the
fall
on
the
train
i
had
a
very
unpleasant
experience
due
to
sis
opening
my
suitcase
to
look
for
a
magazine
and
drawing
out
a
soiled
collar
she
gave
me
a
very
piercing
glance
but
said
nothing
and
at
the
next
opportunity
i
threw
it
out
of
a
window
concealed
in
a
newspaper
we
now
approach
the
catastrophe
my
book
on
play
writing
divides
plays
into
introduction
development
crisis
denouement
and
catastrophe
and
so
one
may
divide
life
in
my
case
the
cinder
proved
the
introduction
as
there
was
none
other
i
consider
that
the
suitcase
was
the
development
my
showing
it
to
jane
raleigh
was
the
crisis
and
the
denouement
or
catastrophe
occurred
later
on
let
us
then
proceed
to
the
catastrophe
jane
raleigh
came
to
see
me
off
at
the
train
her
family
was
coming
the
next
day
and
instead
of
flowers
she
put
a
small
bundle
into
my
hands
keep
it
hidden
bab
she
said
and
tear
up
the
card
i
looked
when
i
got
a
chance
and
she
had
crocheted
me
a
wash
cloth
with
a
pink
edge
for
your
linen
chest
the
card
said
and
i
doing
a
bath
towel
to
match
i
tore
up
the
card
but
i
put
the
wash
cloth
with
the
other
things
i
was
trying
to
hide
because
it
is
bad
luck
to
throw
a
gift
away
but
i
hoped
as
i
seemed
to
be
getting
more
things
to
conceal
all
the
time
that
she
would
make
me
a
small
bath
towel
and
not
the
sort
as
big
as
a
bed
spread
father
went
with
us
to
get
us
settled
and
we
had
a
long
talk
while
mother
and
sis
made
out
lists
for
dinners
and
so
forth
look
here
bab
he
said
something
wrong
with
you
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
only
boy
and
have
got
instead
a
sort
of
young
person
i
do
recognize
i
growing
up
father
i
said
i
did
not
mean
to
rebuke
him
but
ye
gods
was
i
the
only
one
to
see
that
i
was
no
longer
a
child
sometimes
i
think
you
are
not
very
happy
with
us
happy
i
pondered
well
after
all
what
is
happiness
he
took
a
spell
of
coughing
then
and
when
it
was
over
he
put
his
arms
around
me
and
was
quite
affectionate
what
a
queer
little
rat
it
is
he
said
i
only
repeat
this
to
show
how
even
my
father
with
all
his
affection
and
good
qualities
did
not
understand
and
never
would
understand
my
heart
was
full
of
a
longing
to
be
understood
i
wanted
to
tell
him
my
yearnings
for
better
things
my
aspirations
to
make
my
life
a
great
and
glorious
thing
and
he
did
not
understand
he
gave
me
five
dollars
instead
think
of
the
tragedy
of
it
as
we
went
along
and
he
pulled
my
ear
and
finally
went
asleep
with
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
the
bareness
of
my
life
came
to
me
i
shook
with
sobs
and
outside
somewhere
sis
and
mother
made
dinner
lists
then
and
there
i
made
up
my
mind
to
work
hard
and
achieve
to
become
great
and
powerful
to
write
things
that
would
ring
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
to
of
course
and
to
come
back
to
them
some
day
famous
and
beautiful
and
when
they
sued
for
my
love
to
be
kind
and
haughty
but
cold
i
felt
that
i
would
always
be
cold
although
gracious
i
decided
then
to
be
a
writer
of
plays
first
and
then
later
on
to
act
in
them
i
would
thus
be
able
to
say
what
came
into
my
head
as
it
was
my
own
play
also
to
arrange
the
scenes
so
as
to
wear
a
variety
of
gowns
including
evening
things
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
manicuring
my
nails
in
our
state
room
well
we
got
there
at
last
it
was
a
large
house
but
everything
was
to
thin
about
it
the
school
will
understand
this
the
same
being
the
condition
of
the
new
freshman
dormitory
the
walls
were
to
thin
and
so
were
the
floors
the
doors
shivered
in
the
wind
and
palpitated
if
you
slammed
them
also
you
could
hear
every
sound
everywhere
i
looked
around
me
in
despair
where
oh
where
was
i
to
find
my
cherished
solitude
where
on
account
of
hannah
hating
a
new
place
and
considering
the
house
an
insult
to
the
servants
especially
only
one
bathroom
for
the
lot
of
them
she
let
me
unpack
alone
and
so
far
i
was
safe
but
where
was
i
to
work
fate
settled
that
for
me
however
there
is
no
armor
against
fate
death
lays
his
icy
hand
on
kings
shirley
dirge
previously
however
mother
and
i
had
had
a
talk
she
sailed
into
my
room
one
evening
dressed
for
dinner
and
found
me
in
my
robe
de
nuit
curled
up
in
the
window
seat
admiring
the
view
of
the
ocean
well
she
said
is
this
the
way
you
intend
going
to
dinner
i
do
not
care
for
any
dinner
i
replied
then
seeing
she
did
not
understand
i
said
coldly
how
can
i
care
for
food
mother
when
the
sea
looks
like
a
dying
opal
dying
pussycat
mother
said
in
a
very
nasty
way
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
barbara
you
used
to
be
a
normal
child
and
there
was
some
accounting
for
what
you
were
going
to
do
but
now
take
off
that
nightgown
and
i
have
tanney
hold
off
dinner
for
half
an
hour
tanney
was
the
butler
who
had
taken
patrick
place
if
you
insist
i
said
coldly
but
i
shall
not
eat
why
not
you
would
understand
mother
oh
i
would
well
suppose
i
try
she
said
and
sat
down
i
am
not
very
intelligent
but
if
you
put
it
clearly
i
may
grasp
it
perhaps
you
better
speak
slowly
also
so
sitting
there
in
my
room
while
the
sea
throbbed
in
tireless
beats
against
the
shore
while
the
light
faded
and
the
stars
issued
one
by
one
like
a
rash
on
the
face
of
the
sky
i
told
mother
of
my
dreams
i
intended
i
said
to
write
life
as
it
really
is
and
not
as
supposed
to
be
it
may
in
places
be
ugly
i
said
but
truth
is
my
banner
the
truth
is
never
ugly
because
it
is
real
it
is
for
instance
not
ugly
if
a
man
is
in
love
with
the
wife
of
another
if
it
is
real
love
and
not
the
passing
fancy
of
a
moment
mother
opened
her
mouth
but
did
not
say
anything
there
was
a
time
i
said
when
i
longed
for
things
that
now
have
no
value
whatever
to
me
i
cared
for
clothes
and
even
for
the
attentions
of
the
other
sex
but
that
has
passed
away
mother
i
have
now
no
thought
but
for
my
career
i
watched
her
face
and
soon
the
dreadful
understanding
came
to
me
she
too
did
not
understand
my
literary
aspirations
were
as
nothing
to
her
oh
the
bitterness
of
that
moment
my
mother
who
had
cared
for
me
as
a
child
and
obeyed
my
slightest
wish
no
longer
understood
me
and
saddest
of
all
there
was
no
way
out
none
once
in
my
youth
i
had
believed
that
i
was
not
the
child
of
my
parents
at
all
but
an
adopted
one
perhaps
of
rank
and
kept
out
of
my
inheritance
by
those
who
had
selfish
motives
but
now
i
knew
that
i
had
no
rank
or
inheritance
save
what
i
should
carve
out
for
myself
there
was
no
way
out
none
mother
rose
slowly
staring
at
me
with
perfectly
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
i
am
absolutely
sure
she
said
that
you
are
on
the
edge
of
something
it
may
be
typhoid
or
it
may
be
an
elopement
but
one
thing
is
certain
you
are
not
normal
with
this
she
left
me
to
my
thoughts
but
she
did
not
neglect
me
sis
came
up
after
dinner
and
i
saw
mother
fine
hand
in
that
although
not
hungry
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
i
had
begun
to
grow
rather
empty
and
was
nibbling
out
of
a
box
of
chocolates
when
sis
came
she
got
very
little
out
of
me
to
one
with
softness
and
tenderness
i
would
have
told
all
but
sis
is
not
that
sort
and
at
last
she
showed
her
claws
do
fool
yourself
for
a
minute
she
said
this
literary
pose
has
not
fooled
anybody
either
you
doing
it
to
appear
interesting
or
you
done
something
you
scared
about
which
is
it
i
refused
to
reply
because
if
it
the
first
and
you
trying
to
look
literary
you
are
going
about
it
wrong
she
said
real
literary
people
do
go
round
mooning
and
talking
about
the
opal
sea
i
saw
mother
had
been
talking
and
i
drew
myself
up
they
look
and
act
like
other
people
said
leila
going
to
the
bureau
and
spilling
powder
all
over
the
place
look
at
beecher
beecher
i
cried
with
a
thrill
that
started
inside
my
elbows
i
have
read
this
to
one
or
two
of
the
girls
and
they
say
there
is
no
such
thrill
but
not
all
people
act
alike
under
the
influence
of
emotion
and
mine
is
in
my
arms
as
stated
the
playwright
sis
said
he
staying
next
door
and
if
he
does
any
languishing
it
is
not
by
himself
there
may
be
some
who
have
for
a
long
time
had
an
ideal
but
without
hoping
ever
to
meet
him
and
then
suddenly
learning
that
he
is
nearby
with
indeed
but
a
wall
or
two
between
can
be
calm
and
cool
but
i
am
not
like
that
although
long
suppression
has
taught
me
to
dissemble
at
times
where
my
heart
is
concerned
i
am
powerless
for
it
was
at
last
my
heart
that
was
touched
i
who
had
scorned
the
other
sex
and
felt
that
i
was
born
cold
and
always
would
be
cold
that
day
i
discovered
the
truth
reginald
beecher
was
my
ideal
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
nor
indeed
seen
him
except
for
his
pictures
but
the
very
mention
of
his
name
brought
a
lump
to
my
throat
feeling
better
immediately
i
got
sis
out
of
the
room
and
coaxed
hannah
to
bring
me
some
dinner
while
she
was
sneaking
it
out
of
the
pantry
i
was
dressing
and
soon
as
a
new
being
i
was
out
on
the
stone
bench
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
gazing
with
rapt
eyes
at
the
sea
but
fate
was
against
me
eddie
perkins
saw
me
there
and
came
over
he
had
but
recently
been
put
in
long
trousers
and
those
not
his
best
ones
but
only
white
flannels
he
was
never
sure
of
his
garters
and
was
always
looking
to
see
if
his
socks
were
coming
down
well
he
came
over
just
as
i
was
sure
i
saw
reginald
beecher
next
door
on
the
veranda
and
made
himself
a
nuisance
right
away
trying
all
sorts
of
kid
tricks
such
as
snapping
a
rubber
band
at
me
and
pulling
out
hairpins
but
i
felt
that
i
must
talk
to
someone
so
i
said
eddie
if
you
had
your
choice
of
love
or
a
career
which
would
it
be
why
not
both
he
said
hitching
the
rubber
band
onto
one
of
his
front
teeth
and
playing
on
it
neither
ought
to
take
up
all
a
fellow
time
say
listen
to
this
talk
about
a
ukelele
a
woman
can
never
have
both
he
played
a
while
strumming
with
one
finger
until
the
hand
slipped
off
and
stung
him
on
the
lip
once
i
said
i
dreamed
of
a
career
but
i
believe
love
the
most
important
well
i
shall
pass
lightly
over
what
followed
why
is
it
that
a
girl
can
not
speak
of
love
without
every
member
of
the
other
sex
present
no
matter
how
young
thinking
it
is
he
and
as
for
mother
maintaining
that
i
kissed
that
wretched
child
and
they
saw
me
from
the
it
is
not
true
and
never
was
true
it
was
but
one
more
misunderstanding
which
convinced
the
family
that
i
was
carrying
on
all
manner
of
affairs
carter
brooks
had
arrived
that
day
and
was
staying
at
the
cottage
i
got
rid
of
the
perkins
baby
as
his
nose
was
bleeding
but
i
had
not
slapped
him
hard
at
all
and
felt
little
or
no
compunction
when
i
heard
carter
coming
down
the
walk
he
had
called
to
see
leila
but
she
had
gone
to
a
beach
dance
and
left
him
alone
he
never
paid
any
attention
to
me
when
she
was
around
and
i
received
him
coolly
hello
he
said
well
i
replied
is
that
the
way
you
greet
me
bab
it
the
way
i
would
greet
most
any
i
said
i
eat
hash
at
school
but
i
do
have
to
pretend
to
like
it
i
came
to
see
you
how
youthful
of
you
i
replied
in
stinging
tones
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
stared
at
me
what
got
into
you
lately
he
said
just
as
you
getting
to
be
the
prettiest
girl
around
and
i
strong
for
you
you
you
turn
into
a
regular
rattlesnake
the
kindness
of
his
tone
upset
me
considerably
to
who
so
few
kind
words
had
come
recently
i
am
compelled
to
confess
that
i
wept
although
i
had
not
expected
to
and
indeed
shed
few
tears
although
bitter
ones
how
could
i
possibly
know
that
the
chaste
salute
of
eddie
perkins
and
my
head
on
carter
brooks
shoulder
were
both
plainly
visible
against
the
rising
moon
but
this
was
the
case
especially
from
the
house
next
door
but
i
digress
suddenly
carter
held
me
off
and
shook
me
somewhat
sit
up
here
and
tell
me
about
it
he
said
i
getting
more
scared
every
minute
you
are
such
an
impulsive
little
beast
and
you
turn
the
fellows
heads
so
look
here
is
jane
raleigh
lying
or
did
you
run
away
and
get
married
to
someone
i
am
aware
that
i
should
have
said
then
and
there
no
but
it
seemed
a
shame
to
spoil
things
just
as
they
were
getting
interesting
so
i
said
through
my
tears
nobody
understands
me
nobody
and
i
so
lonely
and
of
course
you
have
run
away
with
anyone
have
you
not
exactly
bless
you
bab
he
said
and
i
might
as
well
say
that
he
kissed
me
because
he
did
although
unexpectedly
somebody
just
then
moved
a
chair
on
the
porch
next
door
and
coughed
rather
loudly
so
carter
drew
a
long
breath
and
got
up
there
something
about
you
lately
bab
that
i
do
understand
he
said
you
you
mysterious
that
the
word
in
a
couple
of
years
you
be
the
real
thing
come
and
see
me
then
i
said
in
a
demure
manner
and
he
went
away
so
i
sat
on
my
bench
and
looked
at
the
sea
and
dreamed
it
seemed
to
me
that
centuries
must
have
passed
since
i
was
a
lighthearted
girl
running
up
and
down
that
beach
paddling
and
so
forth
with
no
thought
of
the
future
farther
away
than
my
next
meal
once
i
lived
to
eat
now
i
merely
ate
to
live
and
hardly
that
the
fires
of
genius
must
be
fed
but
no
more
sitting
there
i
suddenly
made
a
discovery
the
boat
house
was
near
me
and
i
realized
that
upstairs
above
the
et
cetera
there
must
be
a
room
or
two
the
very
thought
intrigued
me
a
new
word
for
interest
but
coming
into
use
and
sounding
well
solitude
how
i
craved
it
for
my
work
and
here
it
was
or
would
be
when
i
had
got
the
place
fixed
up
true
the
next
door
was
close
but
a
is
a
quiet
place
generally
and
i
knew
that
nowhere
aside
from
the
desert
is
there
perfect
silence
i
investigated
at
once
but
found
the
place
locked
and
the
boatman
gone
however
there
was
a
lattice
and
i
climbed
up
that
and
got
in
i
had
a
fright
there
as
it
seemed
to
be
full
of
people
but
i
soon
saw
it
was
only
the
family
bathing
suits
hung
up
to
dry
aside
from
the
odor
of
drying
things
it
was
a
fine
study
and
i
decided
to
take
a
small
table
there
and
the
various
tools
of
my
profession
climbing
down
however
i
had
a
surprise
for
a
man
was
just
below
and
i
nearly
put
my
foot
on
his
shoulder
in
the
darkness
hello
he
said
so
it
you
i
was
quite
speechless
it
was
beecher
himself
in
his
dinner
clothes
and
bareheaded
oh
fluttering
heart
be
still
oh
pen
move
steadily
oh
tempora
o
mores
let
me
down
i
said
i
was
still
hanging
to
the
lattice
in
a
moment
he
said
i
have
an
idea
that
the
instant
i
do
vanish
and
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
you
see
he
went
on
i
think
you
must
move
that
bench
bench
you
seem
to
be
so
very
popular
he
said
and
of
course
i
only
a
transient
and
do
matter
but
some
evening
one
of
the
admirers
may
be
on
the
patten
porch
while
another
is
with
you
on
the
bench
and
the
moon
rises
beyond
it
i
was
silent
with
horror
so
that
was
what
he
thought
of
me
like
all
the
others
he
too
did
not
understand
he
considered
me
a
flirt
when
my
only
thoughts
were
serious
ones
of
immortality
and
so
on
you
better
come
down
now
he
said
i
was
afraid
to
warn
you
until
i
saw
you
climbing
the
lattice
then
i
knew
you
were
still
young
enough
to
take
a
friendly
word
of
advice
i
got
down
then
and
stood
before
him
he
was
magnificent
is
there
anything
more
beautiful
than
a
tall
man
with
a
gleaming
expanse
of
dress
shirt
i
think
not
but
he
was
staring
at
me
look
here
he
said
i
afraid
i
made
a
mistake
after
all
i
thought
you
were
a
little
girl
that
need
worry
you
everybody
does
i
replied
i
seventeen
but
i
shall
be
a
mere
child
until
i
come
out
oh
he
said
one
day
i
am
a
child
in
the
nursery
i
said
and
the
next
i
grown
up
and
ready
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
i
beg
your
pardon
i
but
i
am
as
grown
up
now
as
i
will
ever
be
i
said
and
indeed
more
so
i
think
a
great
deal
now
because
i
have
plenty
of
time
but
my
sister
never
thinks
at
all
she
is
too
busy
suppose
we
sit
on
the
bench
the
moon
is
too
high
to
be
a
menace
and
besides
i
am
not
dangerous
now
what
do
you
think
about
about
life
mostly
but
of
course
there
is
death
which
is
beautiful
but
cold
and
one
always
thinks
of
love
does
one
does
one
he
asked
i
could
see
he
was
much
interested
as
for
me
i
dared
not
consider
whom
it
was
who
sat
beside
me
almost
touching
that
way
lay
madness
do
you
ever
he
said
reflect
on
just
ordinary
things
like
clothes
and
so
forth
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
do
get
enough
new
clothes
to
worry
about
mostly
i
think
of
my
work
work
i
am
a
writer
i
said
in
a
low
earnest
tone
no
how
how
amazing
what
do
you
write
i
on
a
play
now
a
comedy
no
a
tragedy
how
can
i
write
a
comedy
when
a
play
must
always
end
in
a
catastrophe
the
book
says
all
plays
end
in
crisis
denouement
and
catastrophe
i
ca
believe
it
he
said
but
to
tell
you
a
secret
i
never
read
any
books
about
plays
we
are
not
all
gifted
from
berth
as
you
are
i
observed
not
to
merely
please
him
but
because
i
considered
it
the
simple
truth
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
in
the
moonlight
all
this
reminds
me
he
said
that
i
have
promised
to
go
to
work
tonight
but
this
is
so
er
thrilling
that
i
guess
the
work
can
wait
well
now
go
on
oh
the
joy
of
that
night
how
can
i
describe
it
to
be
at
last
in
the
company
of
one
who
understood
who
as
he
himself
had
said
in
her
soul
spoke
my
own
language
except
for
the
occasional
mosquito
there
was
no
sound
save
the
tumescent
sea
and
his
voice
often
since
that
time
i
have
sat
and
listened
to
conversation
how
flat
it
sounds
to
listen
to
father
conversing
about
gold
or
sis
about
clothes
or
even
to
the
young
men
who
come
to
call
and
always
talk
about
themselves
we
were
at
last
interrupted
in
a
strange
manner
patten
came
down
their
walk
and
crossed
to
us
walking
very
fast
he
stopped
right
in
front
of
us
and
said
look
here
reg
this
is
about
all
i
can
stand
oh
go
away
and
sing
or
do
something
said
beecher
sharply
you
gave
me
your
word
of
honor
said
the
patten
man
i
can
only
remind
you
of
that
also
of
the
expense
i
incurring
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
shown
all
sorts
of
patience
but
this
is
the
limit
he
turned
on
his
heel
but
came
back
for
a
last
word
or
two
now
see
here
he
said
we
have
everything
fixed
the
way
you
said
you
wanted
it
and
i
give
you
ten
minutes
that
all
he
stalked
away
and
beecher
looked
at
me
ten
minutes
of
heaven
he
said
and
then
perdition
with
that
bunch
look
here
he
said
i
i
awfully
interested
in
what
you
are
telling
me
let
cut
off
up
the
beach
and
talk
oh
night
of
nights
oh
moon
of
moons
our
talk
was
strictly
business
he
asked
me
my
plot
and
although
i
had
been
warned
not
to
do
so
even
to
david
belasco
i
gave
it
to
him
fully
and
even
now
when
all
is
over
i
am
not
sorry
let
him
use
it
if
he
will
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
plots
the
real
tragedy
is
that
we
met
father
he
had
been
ordered
to
give
up
smoking
and
i
considered
he
had
done
so
mother
feeling
that
i
should
be
encouraged
in
leaving
off
cigarettes
so
when
i
saw
the
cigar
i
was
sure
it
was
not
father
it
proved
to
be
however
and
although
he
passed
with
nothing
worse
than
a
glare
i
knew
i
was
in
more
trouble
at
last
we
reached
the
bench
again
and
i
said
good
night
our
relations
continued
to
the
last
he
said
good
night
little
authoress
and
let
have
some
more
talks
i
afraid
i
bored
you
i
said
bored
me
he
said
i
have
spent
such
an
evening
for
years
the
family
acted
perfectly
absurd
about
it
seeing
that
they
were
going
to
make
a
fuss
i
refused
to
say
with
whom
i
had
been
walking
have
thought
i
had
committed
a
crime
it
has
come
to
this
barbara
mother
said
pacing
the
floor
you
can
not
be
trusted
out
of
our
sight
where
do
you
meet
all
these
men
if
this
is
how
things
are
now
what
will
it
be
when
given
your
liberty
well
it
is
to
painful
to
record
i
was
told
not
to
leave
the
place
for
three
days
although
allowed
the
and
of
course
sis
had
to
chime
in
that
she
heard
a
rumor
i
had
run
away
and
got
married
and
although
of
course
she
knew
it
was
true
owing
to
no
time
to
do
so
still
where
there
was
smoke
there
was
fire
but
i
felt
that
their
confidence
in
me
was
going
and
that
night
after
all
were
in
the
land
of
dreams
i
took
that
wretched
suit
of
clothes
and
so
on
to
the
boathouse
and
hid
them
in
the
rafters
upstairs
i
come
now
to
the
strange
event
of
the
next
day
and
its
sequel
the
patten
place
and
ours
are
close
together
and
no
other
house
near
mother
had
been
very
cool
about
the
pattens
owing
to
nobody
knowing
them
that
we
knew
although
i
must
say
they
had
the
most
interesting
people
all
the
time
and
sis
was
crazy
to
call
and
meet
some
of
them
jane
came
that
day
to
visit
her
aunt
and
she
ran
down
to
see
me
first
thing
come
and
have
a
ride
she
said
i
got
the
runabout
and
after
that
we
bathe
and
have
a
real
time
but
i
shook
my
head
i
a
prisoner
jane
i
said
honestly
is
it
the
play
or
something
else
something
else
jane
i
said
i
can
tell
you
nothing
more
i
am
simply
in
trouble
as
usual
but
why
make
you
a
prisoner
unless
she
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
at
me
he
has
claimed
you
she
said
he
is
here
somewhere
about
this
place
and
now
having
had
time
to
think
it
over
you
do
not
want
to
go
to
him
do
deny
it
i
see
it
in
your
face
oh
bab
my
heart
aches
for
you
it
sounded
so
like
a
play
that
i
kept
it
up
alas
with
what
results
what
else
can
i
do
jane
i
said
you
can
refuse
if
you
do
not
love
him
oh
bab
i
did
not
say
it
before
thinking
you
loved
him
but
no
man
who
wears
clothes
like
those
could
ever
win
my
heart
at
least
not
permanently
well
she
did
most
of
the
talking
she
had
finished
the
bath
towel
which
was
a
large
size
after
all
and
monogrammed
and
she
made
me
promise
never
to
let
my
husband
use
it
when
she
went
away
she
left
it
with
me
and
i
carried
it
out
and
put
it
on
the
rafters
with
the
other
things
i
seemed
to
be
getting
more
to
hide
every
day
things
went
all
wrong
the
next
day
sis
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
as
much
as
said
i
was
flirting
with
carter
brooks
although
she
never
intends
to
marry
him
herself
owing
to
his
not
having
money
and
never
having
asked
her
i
spent
the
morning
in
fixing
up
a
studio
in
the
and
felt
better
by
noon
i
took
two
boards
on
trestles
and
made
a
desk
and
brought
a
dictionary
and
some
pens
and
ink
out
i
use
a
dictionary
because
now
and
then
i
am
uncertain
how
to
spell
a
word
events
now
moved
swiftly
and
terribly
i
did
not
do
much
work
being
exhausted
by
my
efforts
to
fix
up
the
studio
and
besides
feeling
that
nothing
much
was
worth
while
when
one
family
did
not
and
never
would
understand
at
eleven
sis
and
carter
and
jane
and
some
others
went
in
bathing
from
our
dock
jane
called
up
to
me
but
i
pretended
not
to
hear
they
had
a
good
time
judging
by
the
noise
although
i
should
think
jane
would
cover
her
arms
and
neck
in
the
water
being
very
thin
legs
one
can
do
nothing
with
although
i
should
think
stripes
going
around
would
help
but
arms
can
have
sleeves
however
the
people
next
door
went
in
too
and
i
thrilled
to
the
core
when
beecher
left
the
and
went
down
to
the
beech
what
a
physique
what
shoulders
all
brown
and
muscular
and
to
think
that
strong
as
they
were
they
wrote
the
tender
love
scenes
of
his
plays
strong
and
tender
what
descriptive
words
they
are
it
was
then
that
i
saw
he
had
been
vaccinated
twice
to
resume
all
the
pattens
went
in
and
a
new
girl
with
them
in
a
one
piece
suit
i
do
not
deny
that
she
was
pretty
i
only
say
that
she
was
not
modest
and
that
the
way
she
stood
on
the
patten
dock
and
posed
for
beecher
benefit
was
unnecessary
and
well
not
respectable
she
was
nothing
to
me
nor
i
to
her
but
i
watched
her
closely
i
confess
that
i
was
interested
in
beecher
why
not
he
was
a
public
character
and
entitled
to
respect
nay
even
to
love
but
i
maintain
and
will
to
my
dying
day
that
such
love
is
different
from
that
ordinarily
born
to
the
other
sex
and
a
thing
to
be
proud
of
well
i
was
seeing
a
drama
and
did
not
even
know
it
after
the
rest
had
gone
patten
came
to
the
door
into
beecher
room
in
the
they
are
all
in
a
row
with
doors
opening
on
the
sand
and
he
had
a
box
in
his
hand
he
looked
around
and
no
one
was
looking
except
me
and
he
did
not
see
me
he
looked
very
fierce
and
glum
and
shortly
after
he
carried
in
a
chair
and
a
folding
card
table
i
thought
this
was
very
strange
but
imagine
how
i
felt
when
he
came
out
carrying
beecher
clothes
he
brought
them
all
going
on
his
tiptoes
and
watching
every
minute
i
felt
like
screaming
however
i
considered
that
it
was
a
practical
joke
and
i
am
no
spoil
sport
so
i
sat
still
and
waited
they
stayed
in
the
water
a
long
time
and
the
girl
with
the
figure
was
always
crawling
out
on
the
dock
and
then
diving
in
to
show
off
leila
and
the
rest
got
sick
of
her
actions
and
came
in
to
lunch
they
called
up
to
me
but
i
said
i
was
not
hungry
i
do
know
what
come
over
bab
i
heard
sis
say
to
carter
brooks
she
crazy
i
think
she
seventeen
he
said
that
all
they
get
over
it
mostly
but
she
has
it
hard
i
loathed
him
pretty
soon
the
other
crowd
came
up
and
i
could
see
every
one
knew
the
joke
but
beecher
they
all
scuttled
into
their
doorways
and
patten
waited
till
beecher
was
inside
and
had
thrown
out
the
shirt
of
his
bathing
suit
then
he
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
there
was
a
silence
for
a
minute
then
beecher
said
in
a
terrible
voice
so
that
the
game
is
it
now
listen
reg
patten
said
in
a
soothing
voice
i
tried
everything
but
force
and
now
i
driven
to
that
i
got
to
have
that
third
act
the
company
got
the
first
two
acts
well
under
way
and
getting
wires
about
every
hour
i
got
to
have
that
script
you
go
to
hell
said
beecher
you
could
hear
him
plainly
through
the
window
high
up
in
the
wall
and
although
i
do
not
approve
of
an
oath
there
are
times
when
it
eases
the
tortured
soul
now
be
reasonable
reg
patten
pleaded
i
put
a
fortune
in
this
thing
and
you
lying
down
on
the
job
you
could
do
it
in
four
hours
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it
there
was
no
answer
to
this
and
he
went
on
i
send
out
food
or
anything
but
nothing
to
drink
there
champagne
on
the
ice
for
you
when
you
finished
however
and
you
find
pens
and
ink
and
paper
on
the
table
the
answer
to
this
was
beecher
full
weight
against
the
door
but
it
held
even
against
the
full
force
of
his
fine
physic
even
if
you
do
break
it
open
patten
said
you
ca
go
very
far
the
way
you
are
now
be
a
good
fellow
and
let
get
this
thing
done
it
for
your
good
as
well
as
mine
you
make
a
fortune
out
of
it
then
he
went
into
his
own
door
and
soon
came
out
looking
like
a
gentleman
unless
one
knew
as
i
did
that
he
was
a
whited
sepulcher
how
long
i
sat
there
paralyzed
with
emotion
i
do
not
know
hannah
came
out
and
roused
me
from
my
trance
of
grief
she
is
a
kindly
soul
although
too
afraid
of
mother
to
be
helpful
come
in
like
a
good
girl
miss
bab
she
said
there
that
fruit
salad
that
cook
prides
herself
on
and
i
ask
her
to
brown
a
bit
of
sweetbread
for
you
hannah
i
said
in
a
low
voice
there
is
a
crime
being
committed
in
this
neighborhood
and
you
talk
to
me
of
food
good
gracious
miss
bab
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
than
that
hannah
i
said
gently
because
it
is
only
being
done
now
and
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
about
it
but
of
course
i
do
not
want
any
food
as
i
say
i
was
perfectly
gentle
with
her
and
i
do
not
understand
why
she
burst
into
tears
and
went
away
i
sat
and
thought
it
all
over
i
could
not
leave
under
the
circumstances
but
yet
what
was
i
to
do
it
was
hardly
a
police
matter
being
between
friends
as
one
may
say
and
yet
i
simply
could
not
bare
to
leave
my
ideal
there
in
that
damp
without
either
food
or
as
one
may
say
raiment
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
it
occurred
to
me
to
try
to
find
a
key
for
the
lock
of
the
i
therefore
left
my
studio
and
proceeded
to
the
house
i
passed
close
by
the
fatal
building
but
there
was
no
sound
from
it
i
found
a
number
of
in
a
drawer
in
the
library
and
was
about
to
escape
with
them
when
father
came
in
he
gave
me
a
long
look
and
said
bee
still
buzzing
i
had
hoped
for
some
understanding
from
him
but
my
spirits
fell
at
this
speech
i
am
still
working
father
i
said
in
a
firm
if
nervous
tone
i
am
not
doing
as
good
work
as
i
would
if
things
were
different
but
i
am
at
least
content
if
not
happy
he
stared
at
me
and
then
came
over
to
me
put
out
your
tongue
he
said
even
against
this
crowning
infamy
i
was
silent
that
all
right
he
said
now
see
here
chicken
get
into
your
riding
togs
and
we
order
the
horses
i
do
intend
to
let
this
upset
your
health
but
i
refused
unless
of
course
you
insist
i
finished
he
only
shook
his
head
however
and
left
the
room
i
felt
that
i
had
lost
my
last
friend
i
did
not
try
the
keys
myself
but
instead
stood
off
a
short
distance
and
threw
them
through
the
window
i
learned
later
that
they
struck
beecher
on
the
head
not
knowing
of
course
that
i
had
flung
them
and
that
my
reason
was
pure
friendliness
and
idealism
he
threw
them
out
again
with
a
violent
exclamation
they
fell
at
my
feet
and
lay
there
useless
rejected
tragic
at
last
i
summoned
courage
to
speak
ca
i
do
something
to
help
i
said
in
a
quaking
voice
to
the
window
there
was
no
answer
but
i
could
hear
a
pen
scratching
on
paper
i
do
so
want
to
help
you
i
said
in
a
louder
tone
go
away
said
his
voice
rather
abstracted
than
angry
may
i
try
the
keys
i
asked
be
still
my
heart
for
the
scratching
had
ceased
who
that
asked
the
beloved
voice
i
say
because
an
ideal
is
always
beloved
the
voice
was
beloved
but
sharp
it
me
i
heard
him
mutter
something
and
i
think
he
came
to
the
door
look
here
he
said
go
away
do
you
understand
i
want
to
work
and
do
come
near
here
again
until
seven
very
well
i
said
faintly
and
then
come
without
fail
he
said
yes
beecher
i
replied
how
commanding
he
was
strong
but
tender
and
if
anyone
comes
around
making
a
noise
before
that
you
shoot
them
for
me
will
you
shoot
them
drive
them
off
or
use
a
anything
but
do
yell
at
them
it
distracts
me
it
was
a
sacred
trust
i
and
only
i
stood
between
him
and
his
magnum
opus
i
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
our
and
took
up
my
vigil
it
was
about
five
when
i
heard
jane
approaching
i
knew
it
was
jane
because
she
always
wears
tight
shoes
and
limps
when
unobserved
although
having
the
reputation
of
the
smallest
foot
of
any
girl
in
our
set
in
the
city
i
prefer
comfort
and
ease
unhampered
by
heals
french
or
otherwise
no
man
will
ever
marry
a
girl
because
she
wears
a
small
shoe
and
catches
her
heals
in
holes
in
the
boardwalk
and
has
to
soak
her
feet
at
night
before
she
can
sleep
however
jane
came
on
and
found
me
crouched
on
the
doorstep
in
a
lowly
attitude
and
holding
my
finger
to
my
lips
she
stopped
and
stared
at
me
hello
she
said
what
do
you
think
you
are
a
statue
hush
jane
i
said
in
a
low
tone
i
can
only
ask
you
to
be
quiet
and
speak
in
whispers
i
can
not
give
the
reason
good
heavens
she
whispered
what
has
happened
bab
it
is
happening
now
but
i
can
not
explain
what
is
happening
jane
i
whispered
earnestly
you
have
known
me
a
long
time
and
i
have
always
been
trustworthy
have
i
not
she
nodded
she
is
never
exactly
pretty
and
now
she
had
opened
her
mouth
and
forgot
to
close
it
then
ask
no
questions
trust
me
as
i
am
trusting
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
beecher
threw
his
pen
at
the
door
and
began
to
pace
the
owing
of
course
to
his
being
in
his
bare
feet
i
was
not
certain
jane
heard
something
too
for
she
clutched
my
arm
bab
she
said
in
intense
tones
if
you
do
explain
i
shall
lose
my
mind
i
feel
now
that
i
am
going
to
shriek
she
looked
at
me
searchingly
somebody
is
a
prisoner
that
all
it
was
the
truth
was
it
not
and
was
there
any
reasons
for
jane
raleigh
to
jump
to
conclusions
as
she
did
and
even
to
repeat
later
in
public
that
i
had
told
her
that
my
lover
had
come
for
me
and
that
father
had
locked
him
up
to
prevent
my
running
away
with
him
immuring
him
in
the
patten
certainly
not
just
then
i
saw
the
boatman
coming
who
looks
after
our
motor
boat
and
i
tiptoed
to
him
and
asked
him
to
go
away
and
not
to
come
back
unless
he
had
quieter
boats
and
would
not
whistle
he
acted
very
ugly
about
it
i
must
say
but
he
went
when
i
came
back
jane
was
sitting
thinking
with
her
forehead
all
puckered
what
i
do
understand
bab
she
said
is
why
no
noise
because
he
is
writing
i
explained
although
his
clothing
has
been
taken
away
he
is
writing
i
do
think
i
told
you
jane
but
that
is
his
business
he
is
a
writer
and
if
i
tell
you
his
name
you
will
faint
with
surprise
she
looked
at
me
searchingly
locked
up
and
writing
and
his
clothing
gone
what
he
writing
bab
his
will
he
is
doing
his
duty
to
the
end
jane
i
said
softly
he
is
writing
the
last
act
of
a
play
the
company
is
rehearsing
the
first
two
acts
and
he
has
to
get
this
one
ready
though
the
heavens
fall
but
to
my
surprise
she
got
up
and
said
to
me
in
a
firm
voice
either
you
are
crazy
barbara
archibald
or
you
think
i
am
been
stuffing
me
for
about
a
week
and
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
and
you
apologize
to
me
or
i
never
speak
to
you
again
she
said
this
loudly
and
then
went
away
and
beecher
said
through
the
door
what
the
devil
the
row
about
perhaps
my
nerves
were
going
or
possibly
it
was
no
luncheon
and
probably
no
dinner
but
i
said
just
as
if
he
had
been
an
ordinary
person
go
on
and
write
and
get
through
i
ca
stew
on
these
steps
all
day
i
thought
you
were
an
amiable
child
i
not
amiable
and
i
not
a
child
do
spoil
your
pretty
face
with
frowns
it
my
face
and
you
ca
see
it
anyhow
i
replied
venting
in
feminine
fashion
my
anger
at
jane
on
the
nearest
object
look
here
he
said
through
the
door
you
been
my
good
angel
doing
more
work
than
i
done
in
two
months
although
it
was
a
dirty
way
to
make
me
do
it
you
not
going
back
on
me
now
are
you
well
i
was
mollified
as
who
would
not
be
so
i
said
well
what
did
patten
do
with
my
clothes
he
took
them
with
him
he
was
silent
except
for
a
muttered
word
you
might
throw
those
keys
back
again
he
said
let
me
know
first
however
you
the
most
accurate
thrower
i
ever
seen
so
i
threw
them
through
the
window
and
i
believe
hit
the
ink
bottle
but
no
matter
and
he
tried
them
but
none
availed
so
he
gave
up
and
went
back
to
work
having
saved
enough
ink
to
finish
with
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
called
to
me
again
and
i
moved
to
the
doorstep
where
i
sat
listening
while
apparently
admiring
the
sea
he
explained
that
having
been
thus
forced
he
had
almost
finished
the
last
act
and
it
was
a
corker
and
he
said
if
he
had
his
clothes
and
some
money
and
a
key
to
get
out
he
go
right
back
to
town
with
it
and
put
it
in
rehearsal
and
at
the
same
time
he
would
give
the
pattens
something
to
worry
about
over
night
because
play
or
no
play
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
lock
a
man
in
a
and
take
his
clothes
away
but
of
course
i
ca
get
my
clothes
he
said
they
take
cussed
good
care
of
that
and
there
the
key
too
we
up
against
it
little
sister
although
excited
by
his
calling
me
thus
i
retained
my
faculties
and
said
i
have
a
suit
of
clothes
you
can
have
thanks
awfully
he
said
but
from
the
slight
acquaintance
we
have
had
i
do
believe
they
would
fit
me
gentleman
clothes
i
said
frigidly
you
have
in
my
studio
i
said
i
can
bring
them
if
you
like
they
look
quite
good
although
creased
you
know
he
said
after
a
moment
silence
i
ca
quite
believe
this
is
really
happening
to
me
go
and
bring
the
suit
of
clothes
and
you
do
happen
to
have
a
cigar
i
suppose
i
have
a
large
box
of
cigarettes
it
is
true
i
heard
him
say
through
the
door
it
is
all
true
i
am
here
locked
in
the
play
is
almost
done
and
a
very
young
lady
on
the
doorstep
is
offering
me
a
suit
of
clothes
and
tobacco
i
pinch
myself
i
am
awake
alas
mingled
with
my
joy
at
serving
my
ideal
there
was
also
grief
my
idle
had
feet
of
clay
he
was
a
slave
like
the
rest
of
us
to
his
body
he
required
clothes
and
tobacco
i
felt
that
before
long
he
might
even
ask
for
an
apple
or
something
to
stay
the
pangs
of
hunger
this
i
felt
i
could
not
bare
perhaps
i
would
better
pass
over
quickly
the
events
of
the
next
hour
i
got
the
suit
and
the
cigarettes
and
even
jane
bath
towel
and
threw
them
in
to
him
also
i
believe
he
took
a
shower
as
i
heard
the
water
running
at
about
seven
he
said
he
had
finished
the
play
he
put
on
the
clothes
which
he
observed
almost
fitted
him
although
gayer
than
he
usually
wore
and
said
that
if
i
would
give
him
a
hair
pin
he
thought
he
could
pick
the
lock
but
he
did
not
succeed
being
now
dressed
however
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
window
and
we
talked
together
it
seemed
like
a
dream
that
i
should
be
there
on
such
intimate
terms
with
a
great
playwright
who
had
just
even
if
under
compulsion
finished
a
last
act
i
bared
my
very
soul
to
him
such
as
about
resembling
julia
marlowe
and
no
one
understanding
my
craving
to
achieve
a
place
in
the
world
of
art
we
were
once
interrupted
by
hannah
looking
for
me
for
dinner
but
i
hid
in
a
and
she
went
away
what
was
food
to
me
compared
with
such
a
conversation
when
hannah
had
disappeared
he
said
suddenly
it
rather
unusual
is
it
your
having
a
suit
of
clothes
and
everything
in
your
er
studio
but
i
did
not
explain
fully
merely
saving
that
it
was
a
painful
story
at
half
past
seven
i
saw
mother
on
the
veranda
looking
for
me
and
i
ducked
out
of
sight
i
was
by
this
time
very
hungry
although
i
did
not
like
to
mention
the
fact
but
beecher
made
a
suggestion
which
was
this
that
the
pattens
were
evidently
going
to
let
him
starve
until
he
got
through
work
and
that
he
would
see
them
in
perdition
before
he
would
be
the
butt
for
their
funny
remarks
when
they
freed
him
he
therefore
tried
to
escape
out
the
window
but
stuck
fast
and
finally
gave
it
up
at
last
he
said
look
here
you
a
curious
child
but
a
nervy
one
how
you
like
to
see
if
you
can
get
the
key
if
you
do
we
go
to
a
hotel
and
have
a
real
meal
and
we
can
talk
about
your
career
although
quivering
with
terror
i
consented
how
could
i
do
otherwise
with
such
a
prospect
for
now
i
began
to
see
that
all
other
emotions
previously
felt
were
as
nothing
to
this
one
i
confess
without
shame
that
i
felt
the
stirring
of
the
tender
passion
in
my
breast
ah
me
that
it
should
have
died
ere
it
had
hardly
lived
where
is
the
key
i
asked
in
a
rapt
but
anxious
tone
he
thought
a
while
generally
he
said
it
hangs
on
a
nail
at
the
back
entry
but
the
chances
are
that
patten
took
it
up
to
his
room
this
time
for
safety
you
know
it
if
you
saw
it
it
has
some
buttons
off
somebody
bathing
suit
tied
to
it
here
it
was
necessary
to
hide
again
as
father
came
stocking
out
calling
me
in
an
angry
tone
but
shortly
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
patten
house
on
shaking
knees
it
was
by
now
twilight
that
beautiful
period
of
romance
although
the
dinner
hour
also
through
the
dusk
i
sped
toward
what
i
knew
not
the
pattens
and
the
lady
were
at
dinner
and
having
a
very
good
time
in
spite
of
having
locked
a
guest
in
the
being
used
to
servants
and
prowling
around
since
at
one
time
when
younger
i
had
a
habit
of
taking
things
from
the
pantry
i
was
quickly
able
to
see
that
the
key
was
not
in
the
entry
i
therefore
went
around
to
the
front
door
and
went
in
being
prepared
if
discovered
to
say
that
someone
was
in
their
and
they
ought
to
know
it
but
i
was
not
heard
among
their
sounds
of
revelry
and
was
able
to
proceed
upstairs
which
i
did
but
not
having
asked
which
was
patten
room
i
was
at
a
loss
and
almost
discovered
by
a
maid
who
was
turning
down
the
beds
much
too
early
also
and
not
allowed
in
the
best
houses
until
since
otherwise
the
rooms
look
undressed
and
informal
i
had
but
time
to
duck
into
another
chamber
and
from
there
to
a
closet
i
remained
in
that
closet
all
night
i
will
explain
no
sooner
had
the
maid
gone
than
a
woman
came
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
i
heard
her
moving
around
and
i
suddenly
felt
that
she
was
going
to
bed
and
might
get
her
robe
de
nuit
out
of
the
closet
i
was
petrified
but
it
seems
while
she
really
was
undressing
at
that
early
hour
the
maid
had
laid
her
night
clothes
out
and
i
was
saved
very
soon
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
somebody
came
in
like
patten
voice
and
said
you
not
going
to
bed
surely
i
going
to
pretend
to
have
a
sick
headache
said
the
other
person
and
i
knew
it
was
the
lady
he
going
to
come
back
in
a
frenzy
and
he
take
it
out
on
me
unless
i
prepared
poor
reggie
said
patten
to
think
of
him
locked
in
there
alone
and
no
clothes
or
anything
it
too
funny
for
words
you
not
married
to
him
my
heart
stopped
beating
was
she
married
to
him
she
was
indeed
my
dream
was
over
and
the
worst
part
of
it
was
that
for
a
married
man
i
had
done
without
food
or
exercise
and
now
stood
in
a
hot
closet
in
danger
of
a
terrible
fuss
no
thank
heaven
said
patten
but
it
was
the
only
way
to
make
him
work
he
is
a
lazy
dog
but
do
worry
we
feed
him
before
he
sees
you
he
always
rather
tractable
after
he
fed
were
all
my
dreams
to
go
would
they
leave
nothing
to
my
shattered
illusions
alas
no
jolly
him
a
little
too
said
can
i
write
it
mrs
beecher
tell
him
he
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
that
will
help
some
vain
you
know
awfully
vain
i
expect
he
written
a
lot
of
piffle
had
they
listened
they
would
have
heard
a
low
dry
sob
wrung
from
my
tortured
heart
but
beecher
had
started
a
vibrator
and
my
anguished
cry
was
lost
well
said
patten
will
has
gone
down
to
let
him
out
i
expect
he
attack
him
he
got
a
vile
temper
i
sit
with
you
till
he
comes
back
if
you
do
mind
i
feeling
nervous
it
was
indeed
painful
to
recall
the
next
half
hour
i
must
tell
the
truth
however
they
discussed
us
especially
mother
who
had
not
called
they
said
that
we
thought
we
were
the
whole
summer
colony
although
every
one
was
afraid
of
mother
tongue
and
nobody
would
marry
leila
except
carter
brooks
and
he
was
poor
and
no
prospects
and
that
i
was
an
incorrigible
and
carried
on
something
ghastly
and
was
going
to
be
put
in
a
convent
i
became
justly
furious
and
was
about
to
step
out
and
tell
them
a
few
plain
facts
when
somebody
hammered
at
the
door
and
then
came
in
it
was
patten
he
gone
he
said
well
he
wo
go
far
in
bathing
trunks
said
beecher
that
just
it
his
bathing
trunks
are
there
well
he
wo
go
far
without
them
he
gone
so
far
i
ca
locate
him
i
heard
beecher
get
up
are
you
in
earnest
will
she
said
do
you
mean
that
he
has
gone
without
a
stitch
of
clothes
and
ca
be
found
patten
gave
a
sort
of
screech
you
do
think
oh
will
he
so
temperamental
you
do
think
drowned
himself
no
such
luck
said
beecher
in
a
cold
tone
i
hated
her
for
it
true
he
had
deceived
me
he
was
not
as
i
had
thought
him
in
our
two
conversations
he
had
not
mentioned
his
wife
leaving
me
to
believe
him
free
to
love
where
he
listed
as
the
poet
says
there
are
a
few
clues
said
patten
he
got
out
by
means
of
a
wire
hairpin
for
one
thing
and
he
took
the
manuscript
with
him
which
hardly
have
done
if
he
meant
to
drown
himself
or
even
if
as
we
fear
he
had
no
pockets
he
has
smoked
a
lot
of
cigarettes
out
of
a
candy
box
which
i
did
not
supply
him
and
he
left
behind
a
bath
towel
that
does
not
i
think
belong
to
us
i
should
think
he
would
have
worn
it
said
beecher
in
a
scornful
tone
here
the
bath
towel
patten
went
on
you
may
recognize
the
initials
i
do
said
beecher
look
here
do
they
call
that
that
flibbertigibbet
next
door
the
little
devil
said
patten
in
a
raging
tone
she
let
him
out
and
of
course
he
done
no
work
on
the
play
or
anything
i
like
to
choke
her
nobody
spoke
then
and
my
heart
beat
fast
and
hard
i
leave
it
to
anybody
how
they
like
to
be
shut
in
a
closet
and
threatened
with
a
violent
death
from
without
would
or
would
they
not
ever
be
the
same
person
afterwords
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
the
beecher
woman
i
climb
up
the
back
of
father
next
door
and
tell
him
what
his
little
daughter
has
done
because
i
know
she
mixed
up
in
it
towel
or
no
towel
reg
is
always
sappy
when
they
seventeen
and
she
been
looking
at
him
for
days
well
the
pattens
went
away
and
beecher
manicured
her
nails
i
could
hear
her
filing
them
and
sang
around
and
was
not
much
concerned
although
for
all
she
knew
he
was
in
the
briny
deep
a
corpse
how
true
it
is
that
the
paths
of
glory
lead
but
to
the
grave
i
got
very
tired
and
much
hotter
and
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
after
what
seemed
like
hours
patten
came
back
all
breathless
and
she
said
the
girl
gone
too
clare
what
girl
next
door
if
you
want
excitement
they
got
it
the
mother
is
in
hysterics
and
there
a
party
searching
the
beach
for
her
body
the
truth
is
of
course
if
that
towel
means
anything
that
reg
has
run
away
with
her
of
course
said
beecher
in
a
resigned
tone
i
wish
he
would
grow
up
and
learn
something
he
becoming
a
nuisance
and
when
there
are
so
many
interesting
people
to
run
away
with
to
choose
that
chit
yes
she
said
that
and
in
my
retreat
i
could
but
sit
and
listen
and
of
course
perspire
which
i
did
freely
patten
went
away
after
talking
about
the
scandal
for
some
time
and
i
sat
and
thought
of
the
beach
being
searched
for
my
body
a
thought
which
filled
my
eyes
with
tears
of
pity
for
what
might
have
been
i
still
hoped
beecher
would
go
to
bed
but
she
did
not
through
the
key
hole
i
could
see
her
with
a
book
reading
and
not
caring
at
all
that
beecher
body
and
mine
too
might
be
washing
about
in
the
cruel
sea
or
have
eloped
to
new
york
i
loathed
her
at
last
i
must
have
slept
for
a
bell
rang
and
there
i
was
still
in
the
closet
and
she
was
answering
it
arrested
she
said
well
i
should
think
he
better
be
if
what
you
say
about
clothing
is
true
well
then
what
he
arrested
for
oh
kidnapping
well
if
i
any
judge
they
ought
to
arrest
the
archibald
girl
for
kidnapping
him
no
do
bother
me
with
it
tonight
i
try
to
read
myself
to
sleep
so
this
was
marriage
did
she
flee
to
her
unjustly
accused
husband
side
and
comfort
him
not
she
she
went
to
bed
at
daylight
being
about
smothered
i
opened
the
closet
door
and
drew
a
breath
of
fresh
air
also
i
looked
at
her
and
she
was
asleep
with
her
hair
in
patent
wavers
ye
gods
the
wife
of
reginald
beecher
thus
to
distort
her
looks
at
night
i
could
not
bare
it
i
averted
my
eyes
and
on
my
tiptoes
made
for
the
window
my
sufferings
were
over
in
a
short
time
i
had
slid
down
and
was
making
my
way
through
the
dewy
morn
toward
my
home
before
the
sun
was
up
or
more
than
starting
i
had
climbed
to
my
casement
by
means
of
a
wire
trellis
and
put
on
my
de
nuit
but
before
i
settled
to
sleep
i
went
to
the
pantry
and
there
satisfied
the
pangs
of
hunger
having
had
nothing
since
breakfast
the
day
before
all
the
lights
seemed
to
be
on
on
the
lower
floor
which
i
considered
wasteful
of
tanney
the
butler
but
being
sleepy
gave
it
no
further
thought
and
so
to
bed
as
the
great
english
pepys
had
said
in
his
dairy
it
seemed
but
a
few
moments
later
that
i
heard
a
scream
and
opening
my
eyes
saw
leila
in
the
doorway
she
screamed
again
and
mother
came
and
stood
beside
her
although
very
drowsy
i
saw
that
they
still
wore
their
dinner
clothes
they
stared
as
if
transfixed
and
then
mother
gave
a
low
moan
and
said
to
sis
that
unfortunate
man
has
been
in
jail
all
night
and
sis
said
jane
raleigh
is
crazy
that
all
then
they
looked
at
me
and
mother
burst
into
tears
but
sis
said
you
little
imp
do
tell
me
you
been
in
that
bed
all
night
i
know
better
i
closed
my
eyes
they
were
not
of
the
understanding
sort
and
never
would
be
if
that
the
way
you
feel
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
i
said
wearily
where
have
you
been
mother
said
in
a
slow
and
dreadful
voice
well
i
saw
then
that
a
part
of
the
truth
must
be
disclosed
especially
since
she
has
for
some
time
considered
sending
me
to
a
convent
although
without
cause
and
has
not
done
so
for
fear
of
my
taking
the
veil
so
i
told
her
this
i
said
i
spent
the
night
shut
in
a
clothes
closet
but
where
is
my
secret
i
can
not
tell
you
barbara
you
must
tell
me
it
is
not
my
secret
alone
mother
she
caught
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
who
was
shut
with
you
in
that
closet
she
demanded
in
a
shaking
voice
barbara
there
is
another
wretched
man
in
all
this
it
could
not
have
been
beecher
because
he
has
been
in
the
station
house
all
night
i
sat
up
leaning
on
one
elbow
and
looked
at
her
earnestly
mother
i
said
you
have
done
enough
damage
interfering
with
careers
not
only
mine
but
another
imperiled
now
by
not
having
a
last
act
i
can
tell
you
no
more
except
here
my
voice
took
on
a
deep
and
intense
fiber
that
i
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
although
unconventional
mother
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
emitted
a
low
despairing
cry
come
leila
said
to
her
as
to
a
troubled
child
come
and
hannah
can
use
the
vibrator
on
your
spine
so
she
went
but
before
she
left
she
said
barbara
if
you
will
only
promise
to
be
a
good
girl
and
give
us
a
chance
to
live
this
scandal
down
i
will
give
you
anything
you
ask
for
mother
sis
said
in
an
angry
tone
what
can
i
do
leila
mother
said
the
girl
is
attractive
and
probably
men
will
always
be
following
her
and
making
trouble
think
of
last
winter
i
know
it
is
bribery
but
it
is
better
than
scandal
i
want
nothing
mother
i
said
in
a
low
heart
stricken
tone
save
to
be
allowed
to
live
my
own
life
and
to
have
a
career
my
heavens
mother
said
if
i
hear
that
word
again
i
go
crazy
so
she
went
away
and
sis
came
over
and
looked
down
at
me
well
she
said
what
happened
anyhow
of
course
you
been
up
to
some
mischief
but
i
do
suppose
anybody
will
ever
know
the
truth
of
it
i
was
hoping
you
make
it
this
time
and
get
married
and
stop
worrying
us
go
away
please
and
let
me
sleep
i
said
as
to
getting
married
under
no
circumstances
did
i
expect
to
marry
him
he
has
a
wife
already
personally
i
think
she
a
total
loss
she
wears
patent
wavers
at
night
and
sleeps
with
her
mouth
open
but
who
am
i
to
interfere
with
the
marriage
bond
i
never
have
and
never
will
but
sis
only
gave
me
a
wild
look
and
went
away
this
dear
readers
and
schoolmates
is
the
true
story
of
my
meeting
with
and
parting
from
reginald
beecher
the
playwright
whatever
the
papers
may
say
it
is
not
true
except
the
fact
that
he
was
recognized
by
jane
raleigh
who
knew
the
suit
he
wore
when
in
the
act
of
pawning
his
ring
to
get
money
to
escape
from
his
captors
the
pattens
it
was
the
necktie
which
struck
her
first
and
also
his
guilty
expression
as
i
was
missing
by
that
time
jane
put
two
and
two
together
and
made
an
elopement
sometimes
i
sit
and
think
things
over
my
fingers
wandering
over
the
ivory
keys
of
the
typewriter
they
gave
me
to
promise
not
to
elope
with
anybody
although
such
a
thing
is
far
from
my
mind
and
the
world
seems
a
cruel
and
unjust
place
especially
to
those
with
ambition
for
reginald
beecher
is
no
longer
my
ideal
my
night
of
the
pen
i
will
tell
about
that
in
a
few
words
jane
raleigh
and
i
went
to
a
matinee
late
in
september
before
returning
to
our
institutions
of
learning
jane
clutched
my
arm
as
we
looked
at
our
programs
and
pointed
to
something
how
my
heart
beat
for
whatever
had
come
between
us
i
was
still
loyal
to
him
this
was
a
new
play
by
him
ah
my
heart
seemed
to
say
now
again
you
will
hear
his
dear
words
although
spoken
by
alien
mouths
the
love
scenes
i
could
not
finish
although
married
and
forever
beyond
me
i
could
still
hear
his
manly
tones
as
issuing
from
the
door
of
the
i
thrilled
with
excitement
as
the
curtain
rose
i
closed
my
eyes
in
ecstasy
bab
jane
said
in
a
quavering
tone
i
looked
what
did
i
see
the
itself
the
very
one
and
as
i
stared
i
saw
a
girl
wearing
her
hair
as
i
wear
mine
cross
the
stage
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
her
hand
and
say
to
the
door
ca
i
do
something
to
help
i
do
so
want
to
help
you
my
very
words
and
a
voice
from
beyond
the
door
said
who
that
his
words
i
could
bare
no
more
heedless
of
jane
protests
and
anguish
i
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
light
of
day
my
body
was
bent
with
misery
because
at
last
i
knew
that
like
mother
and
all
the
rest
he
too
did
not
understand
me
and
never
would
to
him
i
was
but
material
the
stuff
that
plays
are
made
of
now
we
know
that
he
never
could
know
did
not
understand
ignoring
jane
observation
that
the
tickets
had
cost
two
dollars
each
i
gathered
up
the
scattered
skeins
of
my
life
together
and
fled
chapter
iii
her
diary
being
the
daily
journal
of
the
january
i
have
today
received
this
diary
from
home
having
come
back
a
few
days
early
to
make
up
a
french
condition
weather
clear
and
cold
new
year
dinner
roast
chicken
turkey
being
very
expensive
mashed
turnips
sweet
potatoes
and
mince
pie
it
is
my
intention
to
record
in
this
book
the
details
of
my
daily
life
my
thoughts
which
are
to
sacred
for
utterance
and
my
ambitions
because
who
is
there
to
whom
i
can
speak
them
i
am
surrounded
by
those
who
exist
for
the
mere
pleasures
of
the
day
or
whose
lives
are
bound
up
in
recitations
for
instance
at
dinner
today
being
mostly
faculty
and
a
few
girls
who
live
in
the
far
west
the
conversation
was
entirely
on
buying
a
phonograph
for
dancing
because
the
music
teacher
has
the
measles
and
is
quarantined
in
the
infirmary
and
on
miss
everett
cousin
who
has
written
a
play
when
one
looks
at
miss
everett
one
recognizes
that
no
cousin
of
hers
could
write
a
play
new
year
resolution
to
help
someone
every
day
today
helped
mademoiselle
to
put
on
her
rubbers
january
today
i
wrote
my
french
theme
beginning
les
hommes
songent
moins
a
leur
ame
qua
leur
corps
mademoiselle
sent
for
me
and
objected
saying
that
it
was
not
a
theme
for
a
young
girl
and
that
i
must
write
a
new
one
on
the
subject
of
pears
how
is
one
to
develop
in
this
atmosphere
some
of
the
girls
are
coming
back
they
straggle
in
and
put
the
favors
they
got
at
cotillions
on
the
dresser
and
their
holiday
gifts
and
each
one
relates
some
amorous
experience
while
at
home
dear
diary
is
there
something
wrong
with
me
that
love
has
passed
me
by
i
have
had
offers
of
devotion
but
none
that
appealed
to
me
being
mostly
either
too
young
or
not
attracting
me
by
physical
charm
i
am
not
cold
although
frequently
accused
of
it
beneath
my
frigid
exterior
beats
a
warm
heart
i
intend
to
be
honest
in
this
diary
and
so
i
admit
it
but
except
for
passing
fancies
one
being
alas
for
a
married
man
i
remain
without
the
divine
passion
what
must
it
be
to
thrill
at
the
approach
of
the
loved
form
to
harken
to
each
ring
of
the
telephone
bell
in
the
hope
that
if
it
is
not
the
idolized
voice
it
is
at
least
a
message
from
it
to
waken
in
the
morning
and
looking
around
the
familiar
room
to
muse
today
i
may
see
him
on
the
way
to
the
post
office
or
rushing
past
in
his
racing
car
and
to
know
that
at
the
same
moment
he
to
is
musing
today
i
may
see
her
as
she
exercises
herself
at
basket
ball
or
mounts
her
horse
for
a
daily
canter
although
i
have
no
horse
the
school
does
not
care
for
them
considering
walking
the
best
exercise
have
flunked
the
french
again
mademoiselle
not
feeling
well
and
marking
off
for
the
smallest
thing
today
helpful
deed
assisted
one
of
the
younger
girls
with
her
spelling
january
miss
everett
cousin
play
is
coming
here
the
school
is
to
have
free
tickets
as
they
are
trying
it
on
the
dog
which
means
seeing
if
it
is
good
enough
for
the
large
cities
we
have
decided
if
everett
marks
us
well
in
english
from
now
on
to
applaud
it
but
if
she
is
unpleasant
to
sit
still
and
show
no
interest
january
bad
weather
which
is
depressing
to
one
of
my
temperament
also
boil
on
nose
a
few
helpful
deeds
nothing
worth
putting
down
january
boil
cut
again
i
can
face
my
image
in
my
mirror
and
not
shrink
mademoiselle
is
sick
and
no
french
misericorde
helpful
deed
sent
mademoiselle
some
fudge
but
this
school
does
not
encourage
kindness
reprimanded
for
cooking
in
room
school
sympathizes
with
me
we
will
go
to
miss
everett
cousin
play
but
we
will
damn
it
with
faint
praise
january
i
have
written
this
date
and
now
i
sit
back
and
regard
it
as
it
is
impressed
on
this
white
paper
so
dear
diary
is
it
written
on
my
soul
to
others
it
may
be
but
the
tenth
of
january
to
me
it
is
the
day
of
days
oh
tenth
of
january
oh
monday
oh
day
of
my
awakening
it
is
now
late
at
night
and
around
me
my
schoolmates
are
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
young
and
heart
free
lights
being
off
i
am
writing
by
the
faint
luminosity
of
a
candle
propped
up
in
bed
my
mackinaw
coat
over
my
de
nuit
for
warmth
i
sit
and
dream
and
as
i
dream
i
still
hear
in
my
ears
his
final
words
my
darling
my
woman
how
wonderful
to
have
them
said
to
one
night
after
night
the
while
being
in
his
embrace
his
tender
arms
around
one
i
refer
to
the
heroine
in
the
play
to
whom
he
says
the
above
rapturous
words
coming
home
from
the
theater
tonight
still
dazed
with
the
revelation
of
what
i
am
capable
of
once
aroused
i
asked
miss
everett
if
her
cousin
had
said
anything
about
egleston
being
in
love
with
the
leading
character
she
observed
no
but
he
may
be
she
is
very
pretty
possibly
i
remarked
but
i
should
like
to
see
her
in
the
morning
when
she
gets
up
all
the
girls
were
perfectly
mad
about
egleston
although
pretending
merely
to
admire
his
art
but
i
am
being
honest
as
i
agreed
at
the
start
and
now
i
know
as
i
sit
here
with
the
soft
although
chilly
breezes
of
the
night
blowing
on
my
hot
brow
now
i
know
that
this
thing
that
has
come
to
me
is
love
moreover
it
is
the
love
of
my
life
he
will
never
know
it
but
i
am
his
he
is
exactly
my
ideal
strong
and
tall
and
passionate
and
clever
too
he
said
some
awfully
clever
things
i
believe
that
he
saw
me
he
looked
in
my
direction
but
what
does
it
matter
i
am
small
insignificant
he
probably
thinks
me
a
mere
child
although
seventeen
what
matters
oh
diary
is
that
i
am
at
last
in
love
it
is
hopeless
just
now
when
i
had
written
that
word
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
there
is
no
hope
none
i
shall
never
see
him
again
he
passed
out
of
my
life
on
the
train
but
i
love
him
mon
dieu
how
i
love
him
january
we
are
going
home
we
are
going
home
we
are
going
home
we
are
going
home
mademoiselle
has
the
measles
january
the
family
managed
to
restrain
its
ecstasy
on
seeing
me
today
the
house
is
full
of
people
as
they
are
having
a
tonight
sis
had
moved
into
my
room
to
let
one
of
the
visitors
have
hers
and
she
acted
in
a
very
unfilial
manner
when
she
came
home
and
found
me
in
it
well
she
said
expelled
at
last
not
at
all
i
replied
in
a
lofty
manner
i
am
here
through
no
fault
of
my
own
and
i
thank
you
to
have
hannah
take
your
clothes
off
my
bed
she
gave
me
a
bitter
glance
i
never
knew
it
to
fail
she
said
just
as
everything
is
fixed
and
we
recovering
from
you
being
here
for
the
holidays
you
come
back
and
stir
up
a
lot
of
trouble
what
brought
you
anyhow
measles
she
snatched
up
her
ball
gown
very
well
she
said
i
see
that
you
quarantined
miss
barbara
all
right
and
if
you
think
you
going
to
slip
downstairs
tonight
after
dinner
and
worm
yourself
into
this
party
i
show
you
she
flounced
out
and
shortly
afterward
mother
took
a
minute
from
the
florist
and
came
upstairs
i
do
hope
you
are
not
going
to
be
troublesome
barbara
she
said
you
are
too
young
to
understand
but
i
want
everything
to
go
well
tonight
and
leila
ought
not
to
be
worried
ca
i
dance
a
little
you
can
sit
on
the
stairs
and
watch
she
looked
fidgety
i
send
up
a
nice
dinner
and
you
can
put
on
your
dark
blue
with
a
fresh
collar
and
it
ought
to
satisfy
you
barbara
that
you
are
at
home
and
possibly
have
brought
the
measles
with
you
without
making
a
lot
of
fuss
when
you
come
out
oh
very
well
i
murmured
in
a
resigned
tone
i
do
care
enough
about
it
to
want
to
dance
with
a
lot
of
souses
anyhow
barbara
said
mother
i
suppose
you
have
some
one
on
the
string
for
her
i
said
with
the
abandon
of
my
thwarted
hopes
well
i
hope
she
gets
him
because
if
not
i
daresay
i
shall
be
kept
in
the
cradle
for
years
to
come
you
will
come
out
when
you
reach
a
proper
age
she
said
if
your
impertinence
does
not
kill
me
off
before
my
time
dear
diary
i
am
fond
of
my
mother
and
i
felt
repentant
and
stricken
so
i
became
more
agreeable
although
feeling
all
the
time
that
she
does
not
and
never
will
understand
my
temperament
i
said
i
do
care
about
society
and
you
know
it
mother
if
you
keep
leila
out
of
this
room
which
is
much
but
is
my
castle
while
here
i
probably
go
to
bed
early
barbara
sometimes
i
think
you
have
no
affection
for
your
sister
i
had
agreed
to
honesty
january
first
so
i
replied
i
have
of
course
mother
but
i
am
fonder
of
her
while
at
school
than
at
home
and
i
should
be
a
better
sister
if
not
condemned
to
her
old
things
including
hats
which
do
not
suit
my
type
mother
moved
over
majestically
to
the
door
and
shut
it
then
she
came
and
stood
over
me
i
come
to
the
conclusion
barbara
she
said
to
appeal
to
your
better
nature
do
you
wish
leila
to
be
married
and
happy
i
just
said
mother
because
a
very
interesting
thing
is
happening
said
mother
trying
to
look
playful
i
a
chance
any
girl
would
jump
at
so
here
i
sit
dear
diary
while
there
are
sounds
of
revelry
below
and
sis
jumps
at
her
chance
which
is
the
honorable
page
beresford
who
is
an
englishman
visiting
here
because
he
has
a
weak
heart
and
ca
fight
and
father
is
away
on
business
and
i
am
all
alone
i
have
been
looking
for
a
rash
but
no
luck
ah
me
how
the
strains
of
the
orchestra
recall
that
magic
night
in
the
theater
when
adrian
egleston
looked
down
into
my
eyes
and
although
ostensibly
to
an
actress
said
to
my
beating
heart
my
darling
my
woman
i
wonder
if
i
can
control
my
hands
to
write
in
mother
room
across
the
hall
i
can
hear
furious
voices
and
i
know
that
leila
is
begging
to
have
me
sent
to
switzerland
let
her
beg
switzerland
is
not
far
from
england
and
in
england
here
i
pause
to
reflect
a
moment
how
is
this
thing
possible
can
i
love
members
of
the
other
sex
and
if
such
is
the
case
how
can
i
go
on
with
my
life
better
far
to
end
it
now
than
to
perchance
marry
one
and
find
the
other
still
in
my
heart
the
terrible
thought
has
come
to
me
that
i
am
fickle
fickle
or
polygamous
which
dear
diary
i
have
not
been
a
good
girl
my
new
year
resolutions
have
gone
to
airy
nothing
the
way
they
went
was
this
i
had
settled
down
to
a
quiet
evening
spent
with
his
beloved
picture
which
i
had
clipped
from
a
newspaper
adrian
i
had
not
as
yet
met
the
other
and
as
i
sat
in
my
chamber
i
grew
more
and
more
desolate
i
love
life
although
pessimistic
at
times
and
it
seemed
hard
that
i
should
be
there
in
exile
while
my
sister
only
months
older
was
jumping
at
her
chance
below
at
last
i
decided
to
try
on
one
of
sis
frocks
and
see
how
i
looked
in
it
i
thought
if
it
looked
all
right
i
might
hang
over
the
stairs
and
see
what
i
then
scornfully
termed
his
nibs
never
again
shall
i
so
call
him
i
got
an
evening
gown
from
sis
closet
and
it
fitted
me
quite
well
although
tight
at
the
waste
for
me
owing
to
basketball
it
was
also
too
low
so
that
when
i
had
got
it
all
hooked
about
four
inches
of
my
lingerie
showed
as
it
had
been
hard
as
anything
to
hook
i
was
obliged
to
take
the
scissors
and
cut
off
the
said
lingerie
the
result
was
good
although
very
decollete
i
have
no
bones
in
my
neck
or
practically
so
and
now
came
my
moment
of
temptation
how
easy
to
put
my
hair
up
on
my
head
and
then
by
the
servant
staircase
make
my
way
to
the
scene
below
i
however
considered
that
i
looked
pale
although
mature
i
looked
at
least
nineteen
so
i
went
into
sis
room
which
was
full
of
evening
wraps
but
empty
and
put
on
a
touch
of
rouge
with
that
and
my
eyebrows
blackened
i
would
not
have
known
myself
had
i
not
been
certain
it
was
i
and
no
other
i
then
made
my
way
down
the
back
stairs
ah
me
dear
diary
was
that
but
a
few
hours
ago
is
it
but
a
short
time
since
beresford
was
sitting
at
my
feet
thinking
me
a
debutante
and
staring
soulfully
into
my
very
heart
is
it
but
a
matter
of
minutes
since
leila
found
us
there
and
in
a
manner
which
revealed
the
true
feeling
she
has
for
me
ordered
me
to
go
upstairs
and
take
off
maddie
mackenzie
gown
yes
it
was
not
leila
after
all
i
had
forgotten
that
maddie
had
taken
her
room
and
except
for
pulling
it
somewhat
at
the
waist
i
am
sure
i
did
not
hurt
the
old
thing
i
shall
now
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
which
one
i
know
not
my
heart
is
full
romance
has
come
at
last
into
my
dull
and
dreary
life
below
the
revelers
have
gone
the
flowers
hang
their
herbaceous
heads
the
music
has
flowed
away
into
the
river
of
the
past
i
am
alone
with
my
heart
january
how
complicated
my
life
grows
dear
diary
how
full
and
yet
how
incomplete
how
everything
begins
and
nothing
ends
he
is
in
town
i
discovered
it
at
breakfast
i
knew
i
was
in
for
it
and
i
got
down
early
counting
on
mother
breakfasting
in
bed
i
would
have
felt
better
if
father
had
been
at
home
because
he
understands
somewhat
the
way
they
keep
me
down
but
he
was
away
about
an
order
for
shells
not
sea
war
and
i
was
to
bare
my
chiding
alone
i
had
eaten
my
fruit
and
cereal
and
was
about
to
begin
on
sausage
when
mother
came
in
having
risen
early
from
her
slumbers
to
take
the
decorations
to
the
hospital
so
here
you
are
wretched
child
she
said
giving
me
one
of
her
coldest
looks
barbara
i
wonder
if
you
ever
think
whither
you
are
tending
i
ate
a
sausage
what
dear
diary
was
there
to
say
to
disobey
she
went
on
to
force
yourself
on
the
attention
of
beresford
in
a
borrowed
dress
with
your
eyelashes
blackened
and
your
face
painted
i
should
think
mother
i
observed
that
if
he
wants
to
marry
into
this
family
and
is
not
merely
being
dragged
into
it
that
he
ought
to
see
the
worst
at
the
start
she
glared
without
speaking
you
know
i
continued
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
and
everything
too
late
to
back
out
and
then
have
me
sprung
on
him
it
would
be
honest
would
it
barbara
she
said
in
a
terrible
tone
first
disobedience
and
now
sarcasm
if
your
father
was
only
here
i
feel
so
alone
and
helpless
her
tone
cut
me
to
the
heart
after
all
she
was
my
own
mother
or
at
least
maintained
so
in
spite
of
numerous
questions
engendered
by
our
lack
of
resemblance
moral
as
well
as
physical
but
i
did
not
offer
to
embarrass
her
as
she
was
at
that
moment
poring
out
her
tea
i
hid
my
misery
behind
the
morning
paper
and
there
i
beheld
the
fated
vision
had
i
felt
any
doubt
as
to
the
state
of
my
affections
it
was
settled
then
my
heart
leaped
in
my
bosom
my
face
suffused
my
hands
trembled
so
that
a
piece
of
sausage
slipped
from
my
fork
his
picture
looked
out
at
me
with
that
well
remembered
gaze
from
the
depths
of
the
morning
paper
oh
adrian
adrian
here
in
the
same
city
as
i
looking
out
over
perchance
the
same
newspaper
to
perchance
the
same
sun
wondering
ah
what
was
he
wondering
i
was
not
even
then
in
that
first
rapture
foolish
about
him
i
knew
that
to
him
i
was
probably
but
a
tender
memory
i
knew
too
that
he
was
but
human
and
probably
very
conceited
on
the
other
hand
i
pride
myself
on
being
a
good
judge
of
character
and
he
carried
nobility
in
every
lineament
even
the
obliteration
of
one
eye
by
the
printer
could
only
hamper
but
not
destroy
his
dear
face
barbara
mother
said
sharply
i
am
speaking
are
you
being
sulky
pardon
me
mother
i
said
in
my
gentlest
tones
i
was
but
dreaming
and
as
she
made
no
reply
but
rang
the
bell
viciously
i
went
on
pursuing
my
line
of
thought
mother
were
you
ever
in
love
love
what
sort
of
love
i
sat
up
and
stared
at
her
is
there
more
than
one
sort
i
demanded
there
is
a
very
silly
schoolgirl
love
she
said
eying
me
that
people
outgrow
and
blush
to
look
back
on
do
you
do
i
what
do
you
blush
to
look
back
on
it
mother
rose
and
made
a
sweeping
gesture
with
her
right
arm
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
she
said
you
are
impertinent
and
indelicate
at
your
age
i
was
an
innocent
child
not
troubling
with
things
that
did
not
concern
me
as
for
love
i
had
never
heard
of
it
until
i
came
out
life
must
have
burst
on
you
like
an
explosion
i
observed
i
suppose
you
thought
that
babies
silence
mother
shrieked
and
seeing
that
she
persisted
in
ignoring
the
real
things
of
life
while
in
my
presence
i
went
out
clutching
the
precious
paper
to
my
heart
january
i
am
alone
in
my
boudoir
which
is
really
the
old
schoolroom
and
used
now
for
a
sewing
room
my
very
soul
is
sick
oh
diary
how
can
i
face
the
truth
how
write
it
out
for
my
eyes
to
see
but
i
must
for
something
must
be
done
the
play
is
failing
the
way
i
discovered
it
was
this
yesterday
being
short
of
money
i
sold
my
amethyst
pin
to
jane
one
of
the
housemaids
for
two
dollars
throwing
in
a
lace
collar
when
she
seemed
doubtful
as
i
had
a
special
purpose
for
using
funds
had
father
been
at
home
i
could
have
touched
him
but
mother
is
different
i
then
went
out
to
buy
a
frame
for
his
picture
which
i
had
repaired
by
drawing
in
the
other
eye
although
lacking
the
fire
and
passionate
look
of
the
original
at
the
shop
i
was
compelled
to
show
it
to
buy
a
frame
to
fit
the
clerk
was
almost
overpowered
do
you
know
him
she
asked
in
a
low
and
throbbing
tone
not
intimately
i
replied
do
you
love
the
play
she
said
i
crazy
about
it
i
been
back
three
times
parts
of
it
i
know
off
by
heart
he
very
handsome
that
picture
do
do
him
justice
i
gave
her
a
searching
glance
was
it
possible
that
without
any
acquaintance
with
him
whatever
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
it
was
indeed
she
showed
it
in
every
line
of
her
silly
face
i
drew
myself
up
haughtily
i
should
think
it
would
be
very
expensive
going
so
often
i
said
in
a
cool
tone
not
so
very
you
see
the
play
is
a
failure
and
they
give
us
girls
tickets
to
dress
the
house
fill
it
up
you
know
half
the
girls
in
the
store
are
crazy
about
mr
egleston
my
world
shuddered
about
me
what
fail
that
beautiful
play
ending
my
darling
my
woman
it
could
not
be
fate
would
not
be
cruel
was
there
no
appreciation
of
the
best
in
art
was
it
indeed
true
as
miss
everett
has
complained
although
not
in
these
exact
words
that
the
theater
was
only
supported
now
by
chorus
girls
legs
dancing
about
in
utter
abandon
with
an
expression
of
despair
on
my
features
i
left
the
store
carrying
the
frame
under
my
arm
one
thing
is
certain
i
must
see
the
play
again
and
judge
it
with
a
critical
eye
if
it
is
worth
saving
it
must
be
saved
january
is
it
only
a
day
since
i
saw
you
dear
diary
can
so
much
have
happened
in
the
single
lapse
of
a
few
hours
i
look
in
my
mirror
and
i
look
much
as
before
only
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
pallor
who
would
not
be
pale
i
have
seen
him
again
and
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
in
my
heart
page
beresford
is
attractive
and
if
it
were
not
for
circumstances
as
they
are
i
would
not
answer
for
the
consequences
but
things
are
as
they
are
there
is
no
changing
that
and
i
have
read
my
own
heart
i
am
not
fickle
on
the
contrary
i
am
true
as
steal
i
have
put
his
picture
under
my
mattress
and
have
given
jane
my
gold
cuff
pins
to
say
nothing
when
she
makes
my
bed
and
now
with
the
house
full
of
people
downstairs
acting
in
a
flippant
and
noisy
manner
i
shall
record
how
it
all
happened
my
financial
condition
was
not
improved
this
morning
father
having
not
returned
but
i
knew
that
i
must
see
the
play
as
mentioned
above
even
if
it
became
necessary
to
borrow
from
hannah
at
last
seeing
no
other
way
i
tried
this
but
failed
what
for
she
said
in
a
suspicious
way
i
need
it
terribly
hannah
i
said
you
ought
to
get
it
from
your
mother
then
miss
barbara
the
last
time
i
gave
you
some
you
paid
it
back
in
postage
stamps
and
i
written
a
letter
since
they
all
stuck
together
now
and
a
total
loss
very
well
i
said
frigidly
but
the
next
time
you
break
anything
how
much
do
you
want
she
asked
i
took
a
quick
look
at
her
and
i
saw
at
once
that
she
had
decided
to
lend
it
to
me
and
then
run
and
tell
mother
beginning
i
think
ought
to
know
archibald
nothing
doing
hannah
i
said
in
a
most
dignified
manner
but
i
think
you
are
an
old
clam
and
i
do
mind
saying
so
i
was
now
thrown
on
my
own
resources
and
very
bitter
i
seemed
to
have
no
friends
at
a
time
when
i
needed
them
most
when
i
was
as
one
may
say
standing
with
reluctant
feet
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
tonight
i
am
no
longer
sick
of
life
as
i
was
then
my
throws
of
anguish
have
departed
but
i
was
then
utterly
reckless
and
even
considered
running
away
and
going
on
the
stage
myself
i
have
long
desired
a
career
for
myself
anyhow
i
have
a
good
mind
and
learn
easily
and
i
am
not
a
parasite
the
idea
of
being
such
has
always
been
repugnant
to
me
while
the
idea
of
a
few
dollars
at
a
time
doled
out
to
one
of
independent
mind
is
galling
and
how
is
one
to
remember
what
one
has
done
with
one
allowance
when
it
is
mostly
eaten
up
by
small
loans
carfare
stamps
church
collection
rose
water
and
glycerin
and
other
mild
cosmetics
and
the
additional
food
necessary
when
one
is
still
growing
to
resume
dear
diary
having
utterly
failed
with
hannah
and
having
shortly
after
met
sis
on
the
stairs
i
said
to
her
in
a
sisterly
tone
intimate
rather
than
fond
i
daresay
you
can
lend
me
five
dollars
for
a
day
or
so
i
daresay
i
can
but
i
wo
was
her
cruel
reply
oh
very
well
i
said
briefly
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
making
a
grimace
at
her
back
and
she
saw
me
in
a
mirror
when
i
think
she
said
heartlessly
that
that
wretched
school
may
be
closed
for
weeks
i
could
scream
well
scream
i
replied
you
scream
harder
if
i
brought
the
measles
home
on
me
and
if
you
laid
up
you
can
say
to
the
dishonorable
you
got
him
tied
maybe
i
remarked
but
not
thrown
as
yet
a
remark
i
had
learned
from
one
of
the
girls
trudie
mills
who
comes
from
montana
i
was
therefore
compelled
to
dispose
of
my
silver
napkin
ring
from
school
jane
was
bought
up
she
said
and
i
sold
it
to
the
cook
for
fifty
cents
and
half
a
mince
pie
although
baked
with
our
own
materials
all
my
fate
therefore
hung
on
a
paltry
fifty
cents
i
was
torn
with
anxiety
was
it
enough
could
i
for
fifty
cents
steal
away
from
the
sordid
cares
of
life
and
lose
myself
in
obliviousness
gazing
only
it
his
dear
face
listening
to
his
dear
and
softly
modulated
voice
and
wondering
if
as
his
eyes
swept
the
audience
they
might
perchance
light
on
me
and
brighten
with
a
momentary
gleam
in
their
unfathomable
depths
only
this
and
nothing
more
was
my
expectation
how
different
was
the
reality
having
ascertained
that
there
was
a
matinee
i
departed
at
an
early
hour
after
luncheon
wearing
my
blue
velvet
with
my
fox
furs
white
gloves
and
white
topped
shoes
completed
my
outfit
and
my
own
chapeau
showing
the
effect
of
a
rainstorm
on
the
way
home
from
church
while
away
at
school
i
took
a
chance
on
one
of
sis
a
perfectly
maddening
one
of
velvet
as
the
pink
made
me
look
pale
i
added
a
touch
of
rouge
i
looked
fully
out
and
indeed
almost
second
season
i
have
a
way
of
assuming
a
serious
and
mature
manner
so
that
i
am
frequently
taken
for
older
than
i
really
am
then
taking
a
few
roses
left
from
the
decorations
and
thrusting
them
carelessly
into
the
belt
of
my
coat
i
went
out
the
back
door
as
sis
was
getting
ready
for
some
girls
to
play
bridge
in
the
front
of
the
house
had
i
felt
any
grief
at
deceiving
my
family
the
bridge
party
would
have
knocked
them
for
as
usual
i
had
not
been
asked
although
playing
a
good
game
myself
and
having
on
more
than
one
occasion
won
most
of
the
money
in
the
upper
house
at
school
i
was
early
at
the
theater
no
one
was
there
and
women
were
going
around
taking
covers
off
the
seats
my
fifty
cents
gave
me
a
good
seat
from
which
i
opined
alas
that
the
shop
girl
had
been
right
and
business
was
rotten
but
at
last
after
hours
of
waiting
the
faint
tuning
of
musical
instruments
was
heard
from
that
time
i
lived
in
a
daze
i
have
never
before
felt
so
strange
i
have
known
and
respected
the
other
sex
and
indeed
once
or
twice
been
kissed
by
it
but
i
had
remained
cold
my
pulses
had
never
fluttered
i
was
always
concerned
only
with
the
fear
that
others
had
overseen
and
would
perhaps
tell
but
now
i
did
not
care
who
would
see
if
only
adrian
would
put
his
arms
about
me
divine
shamelessness
brave
rapture
for
if
one
who
he
could
not
possibly
love
being
so
close
to
her
in
her
if
one
who
was
indeed
employed
to
be
made
love
to
could
submit
in
public
to
his
embraces
why
should
not
i
who
would
have
died
for
him
these
were
my
thoughts
as
the
play
went
on
the
hours
flew
on
joyous
feet
when
adrian
came
to
the
footlights
and
looking
apparently
square
at
me
declaimed
the
world
owes
me
a
living
i
will
have
it
i
almost
swooned
his
clothes
were
worn
he
looked
hungry
and
gaunt
but
how
true
rags
are
royal
raiment
when
worn
for
virtue
sake
i
shall
stop
here
and
go
down
to
the
pantry
i
could
eat
no
dinner
being
filled
with
emotion
but
i
must
keep
strong
if
i
am
to
help
adrian
in
his
trouble
the
mince
pie
was
excellent
but
after
all
pastry
does
not
take
the
place
of
solid
food
later
i
shall
now
go
on
with
my
recital
as
the
theater
was
almost
empty
at
the
end
of
act
one
i
put
on
the
pink
hat
and
left
it
on
as
though
there
was
no
one
behind
me
and
although
during
act
one
i
had
thought
that
he
perhaps
felt
my
presence
he
had
not
once
looked
directly
at
me
but
the
hat
captured
his
errant
gaze
as
one
may
say
and
after
capture
it
remained
on
my
face
so
much
so
that
i
flushed
and
a
woman
sitting
near
with
a
very
plain
girl
in
a
skunk
collar
observed
really
it
is
outrageous
now
came
a
moment
which
i
thrill
even
to
recollect
for
adrian
plucked
a
pink
rose
from
a
vase
he
was
in
the
millionaire
house
and
was
starving
in
the
midst
of
luxury
and
held
it
to
his
lips
the
rose
not
the
house
of
course
looking
over
it
he
smiled
down
at
me
later
it
is
midnight
i
can
not
sleep
perchance
he
too
is
lying
awake
i
am
sitting
at
the
window
in
my
robe
de
nuit
below
mother
and
sis
have
just
come
in
and
smith
has
slammed
the
door
of
the
car
and
gone
back
to
the
garage
how
puny
is
the
life
my
family
leads
nothing
but
eating
and
playing
with
no
higher
thoughts
a
man
has
just
gone
by
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
recognized
the
footstep
but
no
it
was
but
the
night
watchman
january
father
still
away
no
money
as
mother
absolutely
refuses
on
account
of
maddie
mackenzie
gown
which
she
had
to
send
away
to
be
repaired
january
father
still
away
the
hon
sent
sis
a
huge
bunch
of
orchids
today
she
refused
me
even
one
she
is
always
tight
with
flowers
and
candy
january
the
paper
says
that
adrian
play
is
going
to
close
the
end
of
next
week
no
business
how
can
i
endure
to
know
that
he
is
suffering
and
that
i
can
not
help
even
to
the
extent
of
buying
one
ticket
matinee
today
and
no
money
father
still
away
i
have
tried
to
do
a
kind
deed
today
feeling
that
perhaps
it
would
soften
mother
heart
and
she
would
advance
my
allowance
i
offered
to
manicure
her
nails
for
her
but
she
refused
saying
that
as
hannah
had
done
it
for
many
years
she
guessed
she
could
manage
now
january
today
i
did
a
desperate
thing
dear
diary
the
desperate
is
the
wisest
course
butler
it
is
sunday
i
went
to
church
and
thought
things
over
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
would
be
if
i
could
save
the
play
why
should
i
feel
that
my
sex
is
a
handicap
the
rector
preached
on
the
opportunities
of
women
the
sermon
gave
me
courage
to
go
on
when
he
said
women
today
step
in
where
men
are
afraid
to
tread
and
bring
success
out
of
failure
i
felt
that
it
was
meant
for
me
had
no
money
for
the
plate
and
mother
attempted
to
smuggle
a
half
dollar
to
me
i
refused
however
as
if
i
can
not
give
my
own
money
to
the
heathen
i
will
give
none
mother
turned
pale
and
the
man
with
the
plate
gave
me
a
black
look
what
can
he
know
of
my
reasons
beresford
lunched
with
us
and
as
i
discouraged
him
entirely
he
was
very
attentive
to
sis
mother
is
planing
a
big
wedding
and
i
found
sis
in
the
store
room
yesterday
looking
up
mother
wedding
veil
no
old
stuff
for
me
i
guess
beresford
is
trying
to
forget
that
he
kissed
my
hand
the
other
night
for
he
called
me
little
miss
barbara
today
meaning
little
in
the
sense
of
young
i
gave
him
a
stern
glance
i
am
not
any
littler
than
the
other
night
i
observed
that
was
merely
an
affectionate
diminutive
he
said
looking
uncomfortable
if
you
do
mind
i
said
coldly
you
might
do
as
you
have
heretofore
reserve
your
affectionate
advances
until
we
are
alone
barbara
mother
said
and
began
quickly
to
talk
about
a
lady
something
or
other
we
met
on
a
train
in
switzerland
because
they
can
talk
until
they
are
black
in
the
face
dear
diary
but
it
is
true
we
do
not
know
any
of
the
british
nobility
except
the
aforementioned
and
the
man
who
comes
once
a
year
with
flavoring
extracts
who
says
he
is
the
third
son
of
a
baronet
every
one
being
out
this
afternoon
i
suddenly
had
an
inspiration
and
sent
for
carter
brooks
i
then
put
my
hair
up
and
put
on
my
blue
silk
because
while
i
do
not
believe
in
woman
using
her
feminine
charm
when
talking
business
i
do
believe
that
she
should
look
her
best
under
any
and
all
circumstances
he
was
rather
surprised
not
to
find
sis
in
as
i
had
used
her
name
in
telephoning
i
did
it
i
explained
because
i
knew
that
you
felt
no
interest
in
me
and
i
had
to
see
you
he
looked
at
me
and
said
i
rather
flabbergasted
bab
i
what
ought
i
to
say
anyhow
he
came
very
close
dear
diary
and
suddenly
i
saw
in
his
eyes
the
horrible
truth
he
thought
me
in
love
with
him
and
sending
for
him
while
the
family
was
out
words
can
not
paint
my
agony
of
soul
i
stepped
back
but
he
seized
my
hand
in
a
caressing
gesture
bab
he
said
dear
little
bab
had
my
affections
not
been
otherwise
engaged
i
should
have
thrilled
at
his
accents
but
although
handsome
and
of
good
family
though
poor
i
could
not
see
it
that
way
so
i
drew
my
hand
away
and
retreated
behind
a
sofa
we
must
have
an
understanding
carter
i
said
i
have
sent
for
you
but
not
for
the
reason
you
seem
to
think
i
am
in
desperate
trouble
he
looked
dumfounded
trouble
he
said
you
why
little
bab
if
you
do
mind
i
put
in
rather
pettishly
because
of
not
being
little
i
wish
you
would
treat
me
like
almost
a
debutante
if
not
entirely
i
am
not
a
child
in
arms
you
are
sweet
enough
to
be
if
the
arms
might
be
mine
i
have
puzzled
over
this
since
dear
diary
because
there
must
be
some
reason
why
men
fall
in
love
with
me
i
am
not
ugly
but
i
am
not
beautiful
my
nose
being
too
short
and
as
for
clothes
i
get
none
except
leila
old
things
but
jane
raleigh
says
there
are
women
like
that
she
has
a
cousin
who
has
had
four
husbands
and
is
beginning
on
a
fifth
although
not
pretty
and
very
slovenly
but
with
a
mass
of
red
hair
are
all
men
to
be
my
lovers
carter
i
said
earnestly
i
must
tell
you
now
that
i
do
not
care
for
you
in
that
way
what
made
you
send
for
me
then
good
gracious
i
exclaimed
losing
my
temper
somewhat
i
can
send
for
the
ice
man
without
his
thinking
i
crazy
about
him
ca
i
thanks
the
truth
is
i
said
sitting
down
and
motioning
him
to
a
seat
in
my
maturest
manner
i
i
want
some
money
there
are
many
things
but
the
money
comes
first
he
just
sat
and
looked
at
me
with
his
mouth
open
well
he
said
at
last
of
course
i
suppose
you
know
you
come
to
a
bank
that
gone
into
the
hands
of
a
receiver
but
aside
from
that
bab
it
a
pretty
mean
trick
to
send
for
me
and
let
me
think
well
no
matter
about
that
how
much
do
you
want
i
can
pay
it
back
as
soon
as
father
comes
home
i
said
to
relieve
his
mind
it
is
against
my
principals
to
borrow
money
especially
from
one
who
has
little
or
none
but
since
i
was
doing
it
i
felt
i
might
as
well
ask
for
a
lot
could
you
let
me
have
ten
dollars
i
said
in
a
faint
tone
he
drew
a
long
breath
well
i
guess
yes
he
observed
i
thought
you
were
going
to
touch
me
for
a
hundred
anyhow
i
i
suppose
you
would
give
me
a
kiss
and
call
it
square
i
considered
because
after
all
a
kiss
is
not
much
and
ten
dollars
is
a
good
deal
but
at
last
my
better
nature
won
out
certainly
not
i
said
coldly
and
if
there
is
a
string
to
it
i
do
not
want
it
so
he
apologized
and
came
and
sat
beside
me
without
being
a
nuisance
and
asked
me
what
my
other
troubles
were
carter
i
said
in
a
grave
voice
i
know
that
you
believe
me
young
and
incapable
of
affection
but
you
are
wrong
i
am
of
a
most
loving
disposition
now
see
here
bab
he
said
be
fair
if
i
am
not
to
hold
your
hand
or
or
be
what
you
call
a
nuisance
do
talk
like
this
i
am
but
human
he
said
and
there
is
something
about
you
lately
that
well
go
on
with
your
story
only
as
i
say
do
try
me
to
far
it
like
this
i
explained
girls
think
they
are
cold
and
distant
and
indeed
frequently
are
frequently
until
they
meet
the
right
one
then
they
learn
that
their
hearts
are
as
you
say
but
human
bab
he
said
suddenly
turning
and
facing
me
an
awful
thought
has
come
to
me
you
are
in
love
and
not
with
me
i
am
in
love
and
not
with
you
i
said
in
tragic
tones
i
had
not
thought
he
would
feel
it
deeply
because
of
having
been
interested
in
leila
since
they
went
out
in
their
perambulators
together
but
i
could
see
it
was
a
shock
to
him
he
got
up
and
stood
looking
in
the
fire
and
his
shoulders
shook
with
grief
so
i
have
lost
you
he
said
in
a
smothered
voice
and
then
who
is
the
sneaking
scoundrel
i
forgave
him
this
because
of
his
being
upset
and
in
a
rapt
attitude
i
told
him
the
whole
story
he
listened
as
one
in
a
daze
but
i
gather
he
said
when
at
last
the
recital
was
over
that
you
have
never
met
the
met
him
not
in
the
ordinary
use
of
the
word
i
remarked
but
then
it
is
not
an
ordinary
situation
we
have
met
and
we
have
not
our
eyes
have
spoken
if
not
our
vocal
chords
seeing
his
eyes
on
me
i
added
if
you
do
not
believe
that
soul
can
cry
unto
soul
carter
i
shall
go
no
further
oh
he
exclaimed
there
is
more
is
there
i
trust
it
is
not
painful
because
i
have
stood
as
much
as
i
can
now
without
breaking
down
nothing
of
which
i
am
ashamed
i
said
rising
to
my
full
height
i
have
come
to
you
for
help
carter
that
play
must
not
fail
we
faced
each
other
over
those
vital
words
faced
and
found
no
solution
is
it
a
good
play
he
asked
at
last
it
is
a
beautiful
play
oh
carter
when
at
the
end
he
takes
his
sweetheart
in
his
arms
the
leading
lady
and
not
at
all
attractive
jane
raleigh
says
that
the
star
generally
hates
his
leading
lady
there
is
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
house
must
be
a
jolly
little
thing
well
of
course
i
no
theatrical
manager
but
if
it
any
good
there
only
one
way
to
save
it
advertise
i
did
know
the
piece
was
in
town
which
shows
that
the
publicity
has
been
rotten
he
began
to
walk
the
floor
i
do
think
i
have
mentioned
it
but
that
is
carter
business
not
walking
the
floor
advertising
father
says
he
is
quite
good
although
only
beginning
tell
me
about
it
he
said
so
i
told
him
that
adrian
was
a
mill
worker
and
the
villain
makes
him
lose
his
position
by
means
of
forgery
and
adrian
goes
to
jail
and
comes
out
and
no
one
will
give
him
work
so
he
prepares
to
blow
up
a
millionaire
house
and
his
sweetheart
is
in
it
he
has
been
to
the
millionaire
for
work
and
been
refused
and
thrown
out
saying
just
before
the
butler
and
three
footmen
push
him
through
a
window
in
dramatic
tones
the
world
owes
me
a
living
and
i
will
have
it
socialism
said
carter
hard
stuff
to
handle
for
the
two
dollar
seats
the
world
owes
him
a
living
humph
still
that
a
good
line
to
work
on
look
here
bab
give
me
a
little
time
on
this
eh
what
i
may
be
able
to
think
of
a
trick
or
two
but
mind
not
a
word
to
any
one
he
started
out
but
he
came
back
look
here
he
said
where
do
we
come
in
on
this
anyhow
suppose
i
do
think
of
something
what
then
how
are
we
to
know
that
your
beloved
and
his
manager
will
thank
us
for
butting
in
or
do
what
we
suggest
again
i
drew
myself
to
my
full
height
i
am
a
person
of
iron
will
when
my
mind
is
made
up
i
said
you
think
of
something
carter
and
i
see
that
it
is
done
he
gazed
at
me
in
a
rapt
manner
dammed
if
i
do
believe
you
he
said
it
is
now
late
at
night
beresford
has
gone
the
house
is
still
i
take
the
dear
picture
out
from
under
my
mattress
and
look
at
it
oh
adrien
my
thespian
my
love
january
i
have
a
bad
cold
dear
diary
and
feel
rotten
but
only
my
physical
condition
is
such
i
am
happy
beyond
words
this
morning
while
mother
and
sis
were
out
i
called
up
the
theater
and
inquired
the
price
of
a
box
the
man
asked
me
to
hold
the
line
and
then
came
back
and
said
it
would
be
ten
dollars
i
told
him
to
reserve
it
for
miss
putnam
my
middle
name
i
am
both
terrified
and
happy
dear
diary
as
i
lie
here
in
bed
with
a
hot
water
bottle
at
my
feet
i
have
helped
the
play
by
buying
a
box
and
tonight
i
shall
sit
in
it
alone
and
he
will
perceive
me
there
and
consider
that
i
must
be
at
least
twenty
or
i
would
not
be
there
at
the
theater
alone
hannah
has
just
come
in
and
offered
to
lend
me
three
dollars
i
refused
haughtily
but
at
last
rang
for
her
and
took
two
i
might
as
well
have
a
taxi
tonight
the
family
was
there
i
might
have
known
it
never
do
i
have
any
luck
i
am
a
broken
thing
crushed
to
earth
but
truth
crushed
to
earth
will
rise
whittier
i
had
my
dinner
in
bed
on
account
of
my
cold
and
was
let
severely
alone
by
the
family
at
seven
i
rose
and
with
palpitating
fingers
dressed
myself
in
my
best
evening
frock
which
is
a
pale
yellow
i
put
my
hair
up
and
was
just
finished
when
mother
knocked
it
was
terrible
i
had
to
duck
back
into
bed
and
crush
everything
but
she
only
looked
in
and
said
to
try
and
behave
for
the
next
three
hours
and
went
away
at
a
quarter
to
eight
i
left
the
house
in
a
clandestine
manner
by
means
of
the
cellar
and
the
area
steps
and
on
the
pavement
drew
a
long
breath
i
was
free
and
i
had
twelve
dollars
act
one
went
well
and
no
disturbance
although
adrian
started
when
he
saw
me
the
yellow
looked
very
well
i
had
expected
to
sit
back
sheltered
by
the
curtains
and
only
visible
from
the
stage
i
have
often
read
of
this
method
but
there
were
no
curtains
i
therefore
sat
turning
a
stoney
profile
to
the
audience
and
ignoring
it
as
though
it
were
not
present
trusting
to
luck
that
no
one
i
knew
was
there
he
saw
me
more
than
that
he
hardly
took
his
eyes
from
the
box
wherein
i
sat
i
am
sure
to
that
he
had
mentioned
me
to
the
company
for
one
and
all
they
stared
at
me
until
i
think
they
will
know
me
the
next
time
they
see
me
i
still
think
i
would
not
have
been
recognized
by
the
family
had
i
not
in
a
very
quiet
scene
commenced
to
sneeze
i
did
this
several
times
and
a
lot
of
people
looked
annoyed
as
though
i
sneezed
because
i
liked
to
sneeze
and
i
looked
back
at
them
defiantly
and
in
so
doing
encountered
the
gaze
of
my
maternal
parent
oh
dear
diary
that
i
could
have
died
at
that
moment
and
thus
when
stretched
out
a
pathetic
figure
with
tuber
roses
and
other
flowers
have
compelled
their
pity
but
alas
no
i
sneezed
again
mother
was
wedged
in
and
i
saw
that
my
only
hope
was
flight
i
had
not
had
more
than
between
three
and
four
dollars
worth
of
the
evening
but
i
glanced
again
and
sis
was
boring
holes
into
me
with
her
eyes
only
beresford
knew
nothing
and
was
trying
to
hold
sis
hand
under
her
opera
cloak
any
fool
could
tell
that
but
as
i
was
about
to
rise
and
stand
poised
as
one
may
say
for
departure
i
caught
adrian
eyes
with
a
gleam
in
their
deep
depths
he
was
at
the
moment
toying
with
the
bowl
of
roses
he
took
one
out
and
while
the
leading
lady
was
talking
he
edged
his
way
toward
my
box
there
standing
very
close
apparently
by
accident
he
dropped
the
rose
into
my
lap
oh
diary
diary
i
picked
it
up
and
holding
it
close
to
me
i
flew
i
am
now
in
bed
and
rather
chilly
mother
banged
at
the
door
some
time
ago
and
at
last
went
away
muttering
i
am
afraid
she
is
going
to
be
pettish
january
father
came
home
this
morning
and
things
are
looking
up
mother
of
course
tackled
him
first
thing
and
when
he
came
upstairs
i
expected
an
awful
time
but
my
father
is
a
real
person
so
he
only
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
said
well
chicken
so
you
at
it
again
i
had
to
smile
although
my
chin
shook
you
better
turn
me
out
and
forget
me
i
said
i
was
born
for
trouble
my
advice
to
the
family
is
to
get
out
from
under
that
all
oh
i
do
know
he
said
it
pretty
convenient
to
have
a
family
to
drop
on
when
the
slump
comes
he
thumped
himself
on
the
chest
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
he
observed
just
intended
for
little
daughters
to
fall
back
on
when
other
things
fail
father
i
inquired
putting
my
hand
in
his
because
i
had
been
bearing
my
burdens
alone
and
my
strength
was
failing
do
you
believe
in
love
do
i
but
i
mean
not
the
ordinary
attachment
between
two
married
people
i
mean
love
the
real
thing
i
see
why
of
course
i
do
did
you
ever
read
pope
father
pope
why
i
probably
chicken
why
then
you
know
what
he
says
on
all
laws
but
those
which
love
has
made
look
here
he
said
suddenly
laying
a
hand
on
my
brow
i
believe
you
are
feverish
not
feverish
but
in
trouble
i
explained
and
so
i
told
him
the
story
not
saying
much
of
my
deep
passion
for
adrian
but
merely
that
i
had
formed
an
attachment
for
him
which
would
persist
during
life
although
i
had
never
yet
exchanged
a
word
with
him
father
listened
and
said
it
was
indeed
a
sad
story
and
that
he
knew
my
deep
nature
and
that
i
would
be
true
to
the
end
but
he
refused
to
give
me
any
money
except
enough
to
pay
back
hannah
and
carter
brooks
saying
your
mother
does
not
wish
you
to
go
to
the
theater
again
and
who
are
we
to
go
against
her
wishes
and
anyhow
maybe
if
you
met
this
fellow
and
talked
to
him
you
would
find
him
a
disappointment
many
a
pretty
girl
i
have
seen
in
my
time
who
did
pan
out
according
to
specifications
when
i
finally
met
her
at
this
revelation
of
my
beloved
father
true
self
i
was
almost
stunned
it
is
evident
that
i
do
not
inherit
my
being
true
as
steel
from
him
nor
from
my
mother
who
is
like
steel
in
hardness
but
not
in
being
true
to
anything
but
social
position
as
i
record
this
awful
day
dear
dairy
there
comes
again
into
my
mind
the
thought
that
i
do
not
belong
here
i
am
not
like
them
i
do
not
even
resemble
them
in
features
and
if
i
belonged
to
them
would
they
not
treat
me
with
more
consideration
and
less
discipline
who
in
the
family
has
my
nose
it
is
all
well
enough
for
hannah
to
observe
that
i
was
a
pretty
baby
with
fat
cheeks
may
not
hannah
herself
for
some
hidden
reason
have
brought
me
here
taking
away
the
real
i
to
perhaps
languish
unseen
and
waste
my
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
but
that
way
lies
madness
life
must
be
made
the
best
of
as
it
is
and
not
as
it
might
be
or
indeed
ought
to
be
father
promised
before
he
left
that
i
was
not
to
be
scolded
as
i
felt
far
from
well
and
was
drinking
water
about
every
minute
i
just
want
to
lie
here
and
think
about
things
i
said
when
he
was
going
i
seem
to
have
so
many
thoughts
and
father
yes
chicken
if
i
need
any
help
to
carry
out
a
plan
i
have
will
you
give
it
to
me
or
will
i
have
to
go
to
total
strangers
good
gracious
bab
he
exclaimed
come
to
me
of
course
and
you
do
what
you
told
he
looked
out
into
the
hall
to
see
if
mother
was
near
then
dear
dairy
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
always
have
bab
i
guess
i
run
true
to
form
january
much
better
today
out
and
around
family
mother
and
sis
very
dignified
and
nothing
much
to
say
evidently
have
promised
father
to
restrain
themselves
father
rushed
and
not
coming
home
to
dinner
beresford
on
edge
of
proposing
sis
very
jumpy
later
jane
raleigh
is
home
for
her
cousin
wedding
is
coming
over
we
shall
take
a
walk
as
i
have
much
to
tell
her
what
an
afternoon
how
shall
i
write
it
this
is
a
milestone
in
my
life
i
have
met
him
at
last
nay
more
i
have
been
in
his
dressing
room
conversing
as
though
accustomed
to
such
things
all
my
life
i
have
concealed
under
the
mattress
a
real
photograph
of
him
beneath
which
he
has
written
yours
always
adrian
egleston
i
am
writing
in
bed
as
the
room
is
chilly
or
i
am
and
by
putting
out
my
hand
i
can
touch
his
pictured
likeness
jane
came
around
for
me
this
afternoon
and
mother
consented
to
a
walk
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
take
sis
pink
hat
as
she
keeps
her
door
locked
now
when
not
in
her
room
which
is
ridiculous
because
i
am
not
her
type
and
her
things
do
not
suit
me
very
well
anyhow
and
i
have
never
borrowed
anything
but
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
except
dress
and
the
hat
she
had
however
not
locked
her
bathroom
and
finding
a
bunch
of
violets
in
the
washbowl
i
put
them
on
it
does
not
hurt
violets
to
wear
them
and
anyhow
i
knew
carter
brooks
had
sent
them
and
she
ought
to
wear
only
beresford
flowers
if
she
means
to
marry
him
jane
at
once
remarked
that
i
looked
changed
naturally
i
said
in
a
blase
manner
if
i
did
know
you
bab
she
observed
i
would
say
that
you
are
rouged
i
became
very
stiff
and
distant
at
that
for
jane
although
my
best
friend
had
no
right
to
be
suspicious
of
me
how
do
i
look
changed
i
demanded
i
do
know
you
bab
i
believe
you
are
up
to
some
mischief
mischief
you
do
need
to
pretend
to
me
she
went
on
looking
into
my
very
soul
i
have
eyes
you
not
decked
out
this
way
for
me
i
had
meant
to
tell
her
nothing
but
spying
just
then
a
man
ahead
who
walked
like
adrian
i
was
startled
i
clutched
her
arm
and
closed
my
eyes
bab
she
said
the
man
turned
and
i
saw
it
was
not
he
i
breathed
again
but
jane
was
watching
me
and
i
spoke
out
of
an
overflowing
heart
for
a
moment
i
thought
jane
i
have
met
the
one
at
last
barbara
she
said
and
stopped
dead
is
it
any
one
i
know
he
is
an
actor
ye
gods
said
jane
in
a
tense
voice
what
a
tragedy
tragedy
indeed
i
was
compelled
to
admit
jane
my
heart
is
breaking
i
am
not
allowed
to
see
him
it
is
all
off
forever
darling
said
jane
you
are
trembling
all
over
hold
on
to
me
do
they
disapprove
i
am
never
to
see
him
again
never
the
bitterness
of
it
all
overcame
me
my
eyes
suffused
with
tears
but
i
told
her
in
broken
accents
of
my
determination
to
stick
to
him
no
matter
what
i
might
never
be
adrian
egleston
but
adrian
egleston
she
cried
in
amazement
why
barbara
you
lucky
thing
so
finding
her
fuller
of
sympathy
than
usual
i
violated
my
vow
of
silence
and
told
her
all
and
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
i
said
i
showed
her
the
sachet
over
my
heart
containing
his
rose
it
perfectly
wonderful
jane
said
in
an
awed
tone
you
beat
anything
i
ever
known
for
adventures
you
are
the
type
men
like
for
one
thing
but
there
is
one
thing
i
could
not
stand
in
your
place
having
to
know
that
he
is
making
love
to
the
heroine
every
evening
and
twice
on
wednesdays
and
bab
this
is
wednesday
i
glanced
at
my
wrist
watch
it
was
but
two
instantly
dear
dairy
i
became
conscious
of
a
dual
going
on
within
me
between
love
and
duty
should
i
do
as
instructed
and
see
him
no
more
thus
crushing
my
inclination
under
the
iron
heel
of
resolution
or
should
i
cast
my
parents
to
the
winds
and
go
which
at
last
i
decided
to
leave
it
to
jane
i
observed
i
forbidden
to
try
to
see
him
but
i
daresay
if
you
bought
some
theater
tickets
and
did
not
say
what
the
play
was
and
we
went
and
it
happened
to
be
his
it
would
not
be
my
fault
would
it
i
can
not
recall
her
reply
or
much
more
except
that
i
waited
in
a
pharmacy
and
jane
went
out
and
came
back
and
took
me
by
the
arm
we
going
to
the
matinee
bab
she
said
i
not
tell
you
which
one
because
it
to
be
a
surprise
she
squeezed
my
arm
first
row
she
whispered
i
shall
draw
a
veil
over
my
feelings
jane
bought
some
chocolates
to
take
along
but
i
could
eat
none
i
was
thirsty
but
not
hungry
and
my
cold
was
pretty
bad
to
so
we
went
in
and
the
curtain
went
up
when
adrian
saw
me
in
the
front
row
he
smiled
although
in
the
midst
of
a
serious
speech
about
the
world
owing
him
a
living
and
jane
was
terribly
excited
is
he
the
handsomest
thing
she
said
and
oh
bab
i
can
see
that
he
adores
you
he
is
acting
for
you
all
the
rest
of
the
people
mean
nothing
to
him
he
sees
but
you
well
i
had
not
told
her
that
we
had
not
yet
met
and
she
said
i
could
do
nothing
less
than
send
him
a
note
you
ought
to
tell
him
that
you
are
true
in
spite
of
everything
she
said
if
i
had
not
deceived
jane
things
would
be
better
but
she
was
set
on
my
sending
the
note
so
at
last
i
wrote
one
on
my
visiting
card
holding
it
so
she
could
not
read
it
jane
is
my
best
friend
and
i
am
devoted
to
her
but
she
has
no
scruples
about
reading
what
is
not
meant
for
her
i
said
dear
egleston
i
think
the
play
is
perfectly
wonderful
and
you
are
perfectly
splendid
in
it
it
is
perfectly
terrible
that
it
is
going
to
stop
signed
the
girl
of
the
rose
i
know
that
this
seems
bold
but
i
did
not
feel
bold
dear
dairy
it
was
such
a
letter
as
any
one
might
read
and
contained
nothing
compromising
still
i
daresay
i
should
not
have
written
it
but
out
of
the
fulness
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
i
was
shaking
so
much
that
i
could
not
give
it
to
the
usher
but
jane
did
however
i
had
sealed
it
up
in
an
envelope
now
comes
the
real
surprise
dear
dairy
for
the
usher
came
down
and
said
egleston
hoped
i
would
go
back
and
see
him
after
the
act
was
over
i
think
a
pallor
must
have
come
over
me
and
jane
said
bab
do
you
dare
i
said
yes
i
dared
but
that
i
would
like
a
glass
of
water
i
seemed
to
be
thirsty
all
the
time
so
she
got
it
and
i
recovered
my
savoir
fair
and
stopped
shaking
i
suppose
jane
expected
to
go
along
but
i
refrained
from
asking
her
she
then
said
try
to
remember
everything
he
says
bab
i
am
just
crazy
about
it
ah
dear
dairy
how
can
i
write
how
i
felt
when
being
led
to
him
the
entire
scene
is
engraved
on
my
soul
i
with
my
very
heart
in
my
eyes
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
seem
cool
and
collected
he
in
front
of
his
mirror
drawing
in
the
lines
of
starvation
around
his
mouth
for
the
next
scene
while
on
his
poor
feet
a
valet
put
the
raged
shoes
of
act
ii
he
rose
when
i
entered
and
took
me
by
the
hand
well
he
said
at
last
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
valet
whom
he
treated
like
a
chair
or
table
and
he
held
my
hand
and
looked
deep
into
my
eyes
ah
dear
dairy
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
in
my
life
but
never
again
will
i
know
such
ecstasy
as
at
that
moment
sit
down
he
said
little
lady
of
the
rose
but
it
violets
today
is
it
and
so
you
like
the
play
i
was
by
that
time
somewhat
calmer
but
glad
to
sit
down
owing
to
my
knees
feeling
queer
i
think
it
is
magnificent
i
said
i
wish
there
were
more
like
you
he
observed
just
a
moment
i
have
to
make
a
change
here
no
need
to
go
out
there
a
screen
for
that
very
purpose
he
went
behind
the
screen
and
the
man
handed
him
a
raged
shirt
over
the
top
of
it
while
i
sat
in
a
chair
and
dreamed
what
i
reflected
would
the
school
say
if
it
but
knew
i
felt
no
remorse
i
was
there
and
beyond
the
screen
changing
into
the
garments
of
penury
was
the
only
member
of
the
other
sex
i
had
ever
felt
i
could
truly
care
for
dear
dairy
i
am
tired
and
my
head
aches
i
can
not
write
it
all
he
was
perfectly
respectful
and
only
his
eyes
showed
his
true
feelings
the
woman
who
is
the
adventuress
in
the
play
came
to
the
door
but
he
motioned
her
away
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
at
last
it
was
over
and
he
was
asking
me
to
come
again
soon
and
if
i
would
care
to
have
one
of
his
pictures
i
am
very
sleepy
tonight
but
i
can
not
close
this
record
of
a
january
cold
worse
not
hearing
from
carter
brooks
i
telephoned
him
just
now
he
is
sore
about
beresford
and
said
he
would
not
come
to
the
house
so
i
have
asked
him
to
meet
me
in
the
park
and
said
that
there
were
only
two
more
days
this
being
thursday
later
i
have
seen
carter
and
he
has
a
fine
plan
if
only
father
will
do
it
he
says
the
theme
is
that
the
world
owes
adrian
a
living
and
that
the
way
to
do
is
to
put
that
strongly
before
the
people
suppose
he
said
that
this
fellow
would
go
to
some
big
factory
and
demand
work
not
ask
for
it
demand
it
he
could
pretend
to
be
starving
and
say
world
owes
me
a
living
and
i
intend
to
have
it
but
suppose
they
were
sorry
for
him
and
gave
it
to
him
i
observed
tut
child
he
said
that
would
have
to
be
all
fixed
up
first
it
ought
to
be
arranged
that
he
not
only
be
refused
but
what
more
that
he
be
thrown
out
he
have
to
cut
up
a
lot
see
so
throw
him
out
and
we
have
reporters
there
so
the
story
can
get
around
you
get
it
do
you
your
friend
in
order
to
prove
that
the
idea
of
the
play
is
right
goes
out
for
a
job
and
proves
that
he
can
not
demand
labor
and
get
it
he
stopped
and
spoke
with
excitement
is
he
a
real
sport
would
he
stand
being
arrested
because
that
would
cinch
it
but
here
i
drew
a
line
i
would
not
subject
him
to
such
humiliation
i
would
not
have
him
arrested
and
at
last
carter
gave
in
but
you
get
the
idea
he
said
there
be
the
deuce
of
a
row
and
it
good
for
a
half
column
on
the
first
page
of
the
evening
papers
result
a
jam
that
night
at
the
performance
and
a
new
lease
of
life
for
the
play
egleston
comes
on
bruised
and
battered
and
perhaps
with
a
limp
the
labor
unions
take
up
the
matter
it
a
knock
out
charge
a
thousand
dollars
for
that
idea
if
i
were
selling
it
bruised
i
exclaimed
really
bruised
or
painted
on
he
glared
at
me
impatiently
now
see
here
bab
he
said
i
doing
this
for
you
you
got
to
play
up
and
if
your
young
man
wo
stand
a
bang
in
the
eye
for
instance
to
earn
his
bread
and
butter
he
not
worth
saving
who
are
you
going
to
get
to
to
throw
him
out
i
asked
in
a
faltering
tone
he
stopped
and
stared
at
me
i
like
that
he
said
it
not
my
play
that
failing
is
it
go
and
tell
him
the
scheme
and
then
let
his
manager
work
it
out
and
tell
him
who
i
am
and
that
i
have
a
lot
of
ideas
but
this
is
the
only
one
giving
away
we
had
arrived
at
the
house
by
that
time
and
i
invited
him
to
come
in
but
he
only
glanced
bitterly
at
the
windows
and
observed
that
they
had
taken
in
the
mat
with
on
it
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
went
away
although
we
have
never
had
a
mat
with
on
it
dear
diary
i
wonder
if
father
would
do
it
he
is
gentle
and
kindhearted
and
it
would
be
painful
to
him
but
to
who
else
can
i
turn
in
my
extremity
i
have
but
one
hope
my
father
is
like
me
he
can
be
coaxed
and
if
kindly
treated
will
do
anything
but
if
approached
in
the
wrong
way
or
asked
to
do
something
against
his
principals
he
becomes
a
roaring
lion
he
would
never
be
into
giving
a
man
work
even
so
touching
a
personality
as
adrian
later
i
meant
to
ask
father
tonight
but
he
has
just
heard
of
beresford
and
is
in
a
terrible
temper
he
says
sis
ca
marry
him
because
he
is
sure
there
are
plenty
of
things
he
could
be
doing
in
england
if
not
actually
fighting
he
could
probably
run
a
bus
and
release
some
one
who
can
fight
he
shouted
or
he
could
at
least
do
an
honest
day
work
with
his
hands
do
let
me
see
him
that
all
do
i
understand
that
you
forbid
him
the
house
leila
asked
in
a
cold
fury
just
keep
him
out
of
my
sight
father
snapped
i
suppose
i
ca
keep
him
from
swilling
tea
while
i
am
away
doing
my
part
to
help
the
allies
oh
rot
said
sis
in
a
scornful
manner
while
you
help
your
bank
account
you
mean
i
do
object
to
that
father
but
for
heaven
sake
do
put
it
on
altruistic
grounds
she
went
upstairs
then
and
banged
her
door
and
mother
merely
set
her
lips
and
said
nothing
but
when
beresford
called
later
tanney
had
to
tell
him
the
family
was
out
were
it
not
for
our
affections
and
the
necessity
for
getting
married
so
there
would
be
an
increase
in
the
population
how
happy
we
could
all
be
later
i
have
seen
father
it
was
a
painful
evening
with
sis
shut
away
in
her
room
and
father
cutting
the
ends
off
cigars
in
a
viscious
manner
mother
was
non
est
and
had
i
not
had
my
memories
it
would
have
been
a
sickning
time
i
sat
very
still
and
waited
until
father
softened
which
he
usually
does
like
ice
cream
all
at
once
and
all
over
i
sat
perfectly
still
in
a
large
chair
and
except
for
an
occasional
sneeze
was
quiet
only
once
did
my
parent
address
me
in
an
hour
when
he
said
what
the
devil
making
you
sneeze
so
my
nose
i
think
sir
i
said
meekly
humph
he
said
it
rather
a
small
nose
to
be
making
such
a
racket
i
was
cut
to
the
heart
dear
diary
one
of
my
dearest
dreams
has
always
been
a
delicate
nose
slightly
arched
and
long
enough
to
be
truly
aristocratic
not
really
acqualine
but
on
the
verge
i
hate
my
little
nose
hate
it
hate
it
hate
it
father
i
said
rising
and
on
the
point
of
tears
how
can
you
to
taunt
me
with
what
is
not
my
own
fault
but
partly
hereditary
and
partly
carelessness
for
if
you
had
pinched
it
in
infancy
it
would
have
been
a
good
nose
and
not
a
pug
and
good
gracious
he
exclaimed
why
bab
i
never
meant
to
insult
your
nose
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
a
good
nose
it
exactly
the
sort
of
nose
you
ought
to
have
why
what
in
the
world
would
you
do
with
a
roman
nose
i
have
not
been
feeling
very
well
dear
diary
and
so
i
suddenly
began
to
weep
why
chicken
said
my
father
and
made
me
sit
down
on
his
knee
tell
me
that
my
bit
of
sunshine
is
behind
a
cloud
behind
a
nose
i
said
feebly
so
he
said
he
liked
my
nose
even
although
somewhat
swollen
and
he
kissed
it
and
told
me
i
was
a
little
fool
and
at
last
i
saw
he
was
about
ready
to
be
tackled
so
i
observed
father
will
you
do
me
a
favor
sure
he
said
how
much
do
you
need
business
is
pretty
good
now
and
i
about
landed
the
new
order
for
shells
for
the
english
war
department
i
suppose
we
make
it
fifty
although
we
better
keep
it
a
secret
between
the
two
of
us
i
drew
myself
up
although
tempted
but
what
was
fifty
dollars
to
doing
something
for
adrian
a
mere
bagatelle
father
i
said
do
you
know
miss
everett
my
english
teacher
he
remembered
the
name
would
you
be
willing
to
do
her
a
great
favor
i
demanded
intensely
what
sort
of
a
favor
her
cousin
has
written
a
play
she
is
very
fond
of
her
cousin
and
anxious
to
have
him
succeed
and
it
is
a
lovely
play
he
held
me
off
and
stared
at
me
so
that
is
what
you
were
doing
in
that
box
alone
he
exclaimed
you
incomprehensible
child
why
did
you
tell
your
mother
mother
does
not
always
understand
i
said
in
a
low
voice
i
thought
by
buying
a
box
i
would
do
my
part
to
help
miss
everett
cousin
play
succeed
and
as
a
result
i
was
dragged
home
and
shamefully
treated
in
the
most
mortifying
manner
but
i
am
accustomed
to
brutality
oh
come
now
he
said
i
would
go
as
far
as
that
chicken
well
i
wo
finance
the
play
but
short
of
that
i
do
what
i
can
however
he
was
not
so
agreeable
when
i
told
him
carter
brooks
plan
he
delivered
a
firm
no
although
he
said
somebody
ought
to
do
it
and
show
the
fallacy
of
the
play
in
the
first
place
the
world
does
owe
the
fellow
a
living
unless
he
will
hustle
around
and
make
it
in
the
second
place
an
employer
has
a
right
to
turn
away
a
man
he
does
want
no
one
can
force
a
business
to
employ
labor
well
i
said
as
long
as
labor
talks
and
makes
a
lot
of
noise
and
capitol
is
too
dignified
to
say
anything
most
people
are
going
to
side
with
labor
he
gazed
at
me
right
he
said
you
put
your
finger
on
it
in
true
feminine
fashion
then
why
wo
you
throw
out
this
man
when
he
comes
to
you
for
work
he
intends
to
force
you
to
employ
him
oh
he
does
does
he
said
father
in
a
fierce
voice
well
let
him
come
i
can
stand
up
for
my
principals
too
i
throw
him
out
all
right
dear
diary
the
battle
is
over
and
i
have
won
i
am
very
happy
how
true
it
is
that
strategy
will
do
more
than
violence
we
have
arranged
it
all
adrian
is
to
go
to
the
mill
dressed
like
a
decayed
gentleman
and
father
will
refuse
to
give
him
work
i
have
said
nothing
about
violence
leaving
that
to
arrange
itself
i
must
see
adrian
and
his
manager
carter
has
promised
to
tell
some
reporters
that
there
may
be
a
story
at
the
mill
on
saturday
morning
i
am
to
excited
to
sleep
feel
horrid
forbidden
to
go
out
this
morning
january
beresford
was
here
to
lunch
and
he
and
mother
and
sis
had
a
long
talk
he
says
he
has
kept
it
a
secret
because
he
did
not
want
his
business
known
but
he
is
here
to
place
a
shell
order
for
the
english
war
department
well
leila
said
i
can
hardly
wait
to
tell
father
and
see
him
curl
up
no
no
said
beresford
hastily
really
you
must
allow
me
i
must
inform
him
myself
i
am
sure
you
can
see
why
this
is
a
thing
for
men
to
settle
besides
it
is
a
delicate
matter
archibald
is
trying
to
get
the
order
and
our
new
york
office
if
i
am
willing
is
ready
to
place
it
with
him
well
said
leila
in
a
thunderstruck
tone
if
you
british
do
beat
anything
for
keeping
your
own
counsel
i
could
see
that
he
had
her
hand
under
the
table
it
was
sickening
jane
came
to
see
me
after
lunch
the
wedding
was
that
night
and
i
had
to
sit
through
silver
vegetable
dishes
and
coffee
sets
and
plates
and
a
grand
piano
and
a
set
of
gold
vases
and
a
cabushion
sapphire
and
the
bridesmaid
clothes
and
the
wedding
supper
and
heaven
knows
what
but
at
last
she
said
you
dear
thing
how
weary
and
wan
you
look
i
closed
my
eyes
but
you
do
intend
to
give
him
up
do
you
look
at
me
i
said
in
imperious
tones
do
i
look
like
one
who
would
give
him
up
because
of
family
objections
how
brave
you
are
she
observed
bab
i
am
green
with
envy
when
i
think
of
the
way
he
looked
at
you
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
when
he
made
love
to
that
that
creature
i
am
positively
shaken
we
sat
in
somber
silence
then
she
said
i
daresay
he
detests
the
heroine
does
he
he
tolerates
her
i
said
with
a
shrug
more
silence
i
rang
for
hannah
to
bring
some
ice
water
we
were
in
my
boudoir
i
saw
him
yesterday
said
jane
when
hannah
had
gone
jane
in
the
park
he
was
with
the
woman
that
plays
the
adventuress
ugly
old
thing
i
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
for
i
knew
that
the
adventuress
was
at
least
thirty
and
perhaps
more
besides
being
both
wicked
and
cruel
and
not
at
all
feminine
hannah
brought
the
and
then
came
in
the
most
maddening
way
and
put
her
hand
on
my
forehead
i
done
nothing
but
bring
you
for
two
days
she
said
your
head
hot
i
think
you
need
a
mustard
foot
bath
and
to
go
to
bed
hannah
jane
said
in
her
loftiest
fashion
miss
barbara
is
worried
not
and
please
close
the
door
when
you
go
out
which
was
her
way
of
telling
hannah
to
go
hannah
glared
at
her
if
you
take
my
advice
miss
jane
she
said
you
keep
away
from
miss
barbara
and
she
went
out
slamming
the
door
well
gasped
jane
such
impertinence
old
servant
or
not
she
ought
to
have
her
mouth
slapped
well
i
told
jane
the
plan
and
she
was
perfectly
crazy
about
it
i
had
a
headache
but
she
helped
me
into
my
street
things
and
got
sis
rose
hat
for
me
while
sis
was
at
the
telephone
then
we
went
out
first
we
telephoned
carter
brooks
and
he
said
tomorrow
morning
would
do
and
he
give
a
couple
of
reporters
the
word
to
hang
around
office
at
the
mill
he
said
to
have
adrian
there
at
ten
are
you
sure
your
father
will
do
it
he
asked
we
do
want
a
fliver
you
know
he
making
a
principal
of
it
i
said
when
he
makes
a
principal
of
a
thing
he
does
it
good
for
father
carter
said
tell
him
not
to
be
to
gentle
and
tell
your
to
make
a
lot
of
fuss
the
more
the
better
i
see
the
policeman
at
the
mill
and
he
probably
take
him
up
but
we
get
him
out
for
the
matinee
and
watch
the
evening
papers
it
was
then
that
a
terrible
thought
struck
me
what
if
adrian
considered
it
beneath
his
profession
to
advertize
even
if
indirectly
what
if
he
preferred
the
failure
of
miss
everett
cousin
play
to
a
bruise
on
the
eye
what
in
short
if
he
refused
dear
dairy
i
was
stupified
i
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
for
men
are
not
like
women
who
are
dependable
and
anxious
to
get
along
and
will
sacrifice
anything
for
success
no
men
are
likely
to
turn
on
the
ones
they
love
best
if
the
smallest
things
do
not
suit
them
such
as
cold
soup
or
sleeves
too
long
from
the
or
plans
made
which
they
have
not
been
consulted
about
beforehand
darling
said
jane
as
i
turned
away
you
look
stricken
my
head
aches
i
said
with
a
weary
gesture
toward
my
forehead
it
did
ache
for
that
matter
it
is
aching
now
dear
dairy
however
i
had
begun
my
task
and
must
go
through
with
it
abandoning
jane
at
a
corner
in
spite
of
her
calling
me
cruel
and
even
sneaking
i
went
to
adrian
hotel
which
i
had
learned
of
during
my
seance
in
his
room
while
he
was
changing
his
garments
behind
a
screen
as
it
was
marked
on
a
dressing
case
it
was
then
five
how
nervous
i
felt
as
i
sent
up
my
name
to
his
chamber
oh
dear
diary
to
think
that
it
was
but
five
hours
ago
that
i
sat
and
waited
while
people
who
guessed
not
the
inner
trepidation
of
my
heart
past
and
repast
and
glanced
at
me
and
at
leila
pink
hat
above
at
last
he
came
my
heart
beat
thunderously
as
he
approached
striding
along
in
that
familiar
walk
swinging
his
strong
and
tender
arms
and
i
i
beheld
him
coming
and
could
think
of
not
a
word
to
say
well
he
said
pausing
in
front
of
me
i
knew
i
was
going
to
be
lucky
today
friday
is
my
best
day
i
was
born
on
friday
i
said
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
did
i
say
it
was
my
lucky
day
but
you
must
sit
here
what
do
you
say
to
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
restaurant
how
grown
up
and
like
a
debutante
i
felt
dear
diary
going
to
have
tea
as
if
i
had
it
every
day
at
school
with
a
handsome
actor
across
although
somewhat
uneasy
also
owing
to
the
possibility
of
the
family
coming
in
but
it
did
not
and
i
had
a
truly
happy
hour
not
at
all
spoiled
by
looking
out
the
window
and
seeing
jane
going
by
with
her
eyes
popping
out
and
walking
very
slowly
so
i
would
invite
her
to
come
in
which
i
did
not
dear
diary
he
will
do
it
at
first
he
did
not
understand
and
looked
astounded
but
when
i
told
him
of
carter
being
in
the
advertizing
business
and
father
owning
a
large
mill
and
that
there
would
be
reporters
and
so
on
he
became
thoughtful
it
really
incredibly
clever
he
said
and
if
it
pulled
off
right
it
ought
to
be
a
stampede
but
i
like
to
see
brooks
we
ca
have
it
fail
you
know
he
leaned
over
the
table
it
straight
goods
is
it
miss
er
barbara
there
nothing
phoney
about
it
phoney
i
said
drawing
back
certainly
not
he
kept
on
leaning
over
the
table
i
wonder
he
said
what
makes
you
so
interested
in
the
play
oh
diary
diary
and
just
then
i
looked
up
and
the
adventuress
was
staring
in
the
door
at
me
with
the
meanest
look
on
her
face
i
draw
a
veil
over
the
remainder
of
our
happy
hour
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
considers
me
exactly
the
type
he
finds
most
attractive
and
that
he
does
not
consider
my
nose
too
short
we
had
a
long
dispute
about
this
he
thinks
i
am
wrong
and
says
i
am
not
an
aquiline
type
he
says
i
am
romantic
and
of
a
loving
disposition
also
somewhat
reckless
and
he
gave
me
good
advice
about
doing
what
my
family
consider
for
my
good
at
least
until
i
come
out
but
our
talk
was
all
too
short
for
a
fat
man
with
three
rings
on
came
in
and
sat
down
with
us
and
ordered
a
whiskey
and
soda
my
blood
turned
cold
for
fear
some
one
i
knew
would
come
in
and
see
me
sitting
there
in
a
drinking
party
and
my
blood
was
right
to
turn
cold
for
just
as
he
had
told
the
manager
about
the
arrangement
i
had
made
and
the
manager
said
bully
and
raised
his
glass
to
drink
to
me
i
looked
across
and
there
was
mother
aunt
old
susan
paget
sitting
near
with
the
most
awful
face
i
ever
saw
i
collapsed
in
my
chair
dear
diary
i
only
remember
saying
well
remember
ten
and
dress
up
like
a
gentleman
in
hard
luck
and
his
saying
well
i
hope
i
a
gentleman
and
the
hard
luck
no
joke
and
then
i
went
away
and
now
dear
diary
i
am
in
bed
and
every
time
the
telephone
rings
i
have
a
chill
and
in
between
times
i
drink
and
sneeze
how
terrible
a
thing
is
love
later
i
can
hardly
write
switzerland
is
a
settled
thing
father
is
not
home
tonight
and
i
can
not
appeal
to
him
susan
paget
said
i
was
drinking
too
and
mother
is
having
the
vibrator
used
on
her
spine
if
i
felt
better
i
would
run
away
january
how
can
i
write
what
has
happened
it
is
so
terrible
beresford
went
at
ten
to
ask
for
leila
and
did
not
send
in
his
card
for
fear
father
would
refuse
to
see
him
and
father
thought
from
his
saying
that
he
had
come
to
ask
for
something
and
so
on
that
it
was
adrian
and
threw
him
out
he
ordered
him
out
first
and
beresford
refused
to
go
and
they
had
words
and
then
there
was
a
fight
the
reporters
got
it
and
it
is
in
all
the
papers
hannah
has
just
brought
one
in
it
is
headed
manufacturer
assaults
peer
leila
is
in
bed
and
the
doctor
is
with
her
later
adrian
has
disappeared
the
manager
has
just
called
up
and
with
shaking
knees
i
went
to
the
telephone
adrian
went
to
the
mill
a
little
after
ten
and
has
not
been
seen
since
it
is
in
vain
i
protest
that
he
has
not
eloped
with
me
it
is
almost
time
now
for
the
matinee
and
no
adrian
what
shall
i
do
saturday
dear
diary
i
have
the
measles
i
am
all
broken
out
and
look
horrible
but
what
is
a
sickness
of
the
body
compared
to
the
agony
of
my
mind
oh
dear
diary
to
think
of
what
has
happened
since
last
i
saw
your
stainless
pages
what
is
a
sickness
to
a
broken
heart
and
to
a
heart
broken
while
trying
to
help
another
who
did
not
deserve
to
be
helped
but
if
he
deceived
me
he
has
paid
for
it
and
did
until
he
was
rescued
at
ten
tonight
i
have
been
given
a
sleeping
medicine
and
until
it
takes
affect
i
shall
write
out
the
tragedy
of
this
day
omitting
nothing
the
trained
nurse
is
asleep
on
a
cot
and
her
cap
is
hanging
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
have
tried
it
on
dear
diary
and
it
is
very
becoming
if
they
insist
on
switzerland
i
think
i
shall
run
away
and
be
a
trained
nurse
it
is
easy
work
although
sleeping
on
a
cot
is
not
always
comfortable
but
at
least
a
trained
nurse
leads
her
own
life
and
is
not
bullied
by
her
family
and
more
she
does
good
constantly
i
feel
tonight
that
i
should
like
to
do
good
and
help
the
sick
and
perhaps
go
to
the
front
i
know
a
lot
of
college
men
in
the
american
ambulance
i
shall
never
go
on
the
stage
dear
diary
i
know
now
its
deceitfulness
and
vicissitudes
my
heart
has
bled
until
it
can
bleed
no
more
as
a
result
of
a
theatrical
adonis
i
am
through
with
the
theater
forever
i
shall
begin
at
the
beginning
i
left
off
where
adrian
had
disappeared
although
feeling
very
strange
and
looking
a
queer
red
color
in
my
mirror
i
rose
and
dressed
myself
i
felt
that
something
had
slipped
and
i
must
find
adrian
it
is
strange
with
what
coldness
i
write
that
once
beloved
name
while
dressing
i
perceived
that
my
chest
and
arms
were
covered
with
small
red
dots
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
myself
i
slipped
downstairs
and
outside
the
drawing
room
i
heard
mother
conversing
in
a
loud
and
angry
tone
with
a
visitor
i
glanced
in
and
ye
gods
it
was
the
adventuress
drawing
somewhat
back
i
listened
oh
diary
what
a
revelation
but
i
must
see
her
she
was
saying
time
is
flying
in
a
half
hour
the
performance
begins
and
he
can
not
be
found
i
ca
understand
mother
said
in
a
stiff
manner
what
can
my
daughter
barbara
know
about
him
the
adventuress
sniffed
humph
she
said
she
knows
alright
and
i
like
to
see
her
in
a
hurry
if
she
is
in
the
house
certainly
she
is
in
the
house
said
mother
are
you
sure
of
that
because
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
she
has
run
away
with
him
she
has
been
hanging
around
him
all
week
and
only
yesterday
afternoon
i
found
them
together
she
had
some
sort
of
a
scheme
he
said
afterwards
and
he
wrinkled
a
coat
under
his
mattress
last
night
he
said
it
was
to
look
as
if
he
had
slept
in
it
i
know
nothing
further
of
your
daughter
scheme
but
i
know
he
went
out
to
meet
her
he
has
not
been
seen
since
his
manager
has
hunted
for
to
hours
just
a
moment
said
mother
in
a
frigid
tone
am
i
to
understand
that
this
this
egleston
is
he
is
my
husband
ah
dear
diary
that
i
might
then
and
there
have
passed
away
but
i
did
not
i
stood
there
with
my
heart
crushed
until
i
felt
strong
enough
to
escape
then
i
fled
like
a
guilty
soul
it
was
ghastly
on
the
doorstep
i
met
jane
she
gazed
at
me
strangely
when
she
saw
my
face
and
then
clutched
me
by
the
arm
bab
she
cried
what
on
the
earth
is
the
matter
with
your
complexion
but
i
was
desperate
let
me
go
i
said
only
lend
me
two
dollars
for
a
taxi
and
let
me
go
something
horrible
has
happened
she
gave
me
ninety
cents
which
was
all
she
had
and
i
rushed
down
the
street
followed
by
her
piercing
gaze
although
realizing
that
my
life
at
least
the
part
of
it
pertaining
to
sentiment
was
over
i
knew
that
single
or
married
i
must
find
him
i
could
not
bare
to
think
that
i
in
my
desire
to
help
had
ruined
miss
everett
cousin
play
luckily
i
got
a
taxi
at
the
corner
and
i
ordered
it
to
drive
to
the
mill
i
sank
back
bathed
in
hot
perspiration
and
on
consulting
my
bracelet
watch
found
i
had
but
twenty
five
minutes
until
the
curtain
went
up
i
must
find
him
but
where
and
how
i
confess
for
a
moment
that
i
doubted
my
own
father
who
can
be
very
fierce
on
occasion
what
if
maddened
by
his
mistake
about
beresford
he
had
on
being
approached
by
adrian
been
driven
to
violence
what
if
in
my
endeavor
to
help
one
who
was
unworthy
i
had
led
my
poor
paternal
parent
into
crime
hell
is
paved
with
good
intentions
samuel
johnston
on
driving
madly
into
the
mill
yard
i
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
saturday
and
a
half
holiday
the
mill
was
going
but
the
offices
were
closed
father
then
was
immured
in
the
safety
of
his
club
and
could
not
be
reached
except
by
pay
telephone
and
the
taxi
was
now
ninety
cents
i
got
out
and
paid
the
man
i
felt
very
dizzy
and
queer
and
was
very
thirsty
so
i
went
to
the
hydrant
in
the
yard
and
got
a
drink
of
water
i
did
not
as
yet
suspect
measles
but
laid
it
all
to
my
agony
of
mind
having
thus
refreshed
myself
i
looked
about
and
saw
the
yard
policeman
a
new
one
who
did
not
know
me
as
i
am
away
at
school
most
of
the
time
and
the
family
is
not
expected
to
visit
the
mill
because
of
dirt
and
possible
accidents
i
approached
him
however
and
he
stood
still
and
stared
at
me
officer
i
said
in
my
most
dignified
tones
i
am
looking
for
a
for
a
gentleman
who
came
here
this
morning
to
look
for
work
there
was
about
two
hundred
lined
up
here
this
morning
miss
he
said
which
one
would
it
be
now
how
my
heart
sank
about
what
time
would
he
be
coming
he
said
things
have
been
kind
of
around
here
today
owing
to
a
little
trouble
this
morning
but
perhaps
i
remember
him
but
although
adrian
is
of
an
unusual
type
i
felt
that
i
could
not
describe
him
besides
having
a
terrible
headache
so
i
asked
if
he
would
lend
me
carfare
which
he
did
with
a
strange
look
you
not
feeling
sick
miss
are
you
he
said
but
i
could
not
stay
to
converse
as
it
was
then
time
for
the
curtain
to
go
up
and
still
no
adrian
i
had
but
one
refuge
in
mind
carter
brooks
and
to
him
i
fled
on
the
wings
of
misery
in
the
street
car
i
burst
into
his
advertizing
office
like
a
fury
where
is
he
i
demanded
where
have
you
and
your
plotting
hidden
him
who
beresford
he
asked
in
a
placid
manner
he
is
at
his
hotel
i
believe
putting
beefsteak
on
a
bad
eye
believe
me
bab
beresford
i
cried
in
scorn
and
wretchedness
what
is
he
to
me
or
his
eye
either
i
refer
to
egleston
it
is
time
for
the
curtain
to
go
up
now
and
unless
he
has
by
this
time
returned
there
can
be
no
performance
look
here
carter
said
suddenly
you
look
awfully
queer
bab
your
face
i
stamped
my
foot
what
does
my
face
matter
i
demanded
i
no
longer
care
for
him
but
i
have
ruined
miss
everett
cousin
play
unless
he
turns
up
am
i
to
be
sent
to
switzerland
with
that
on
my
soul
switzerland
he
said
slowly
why
bab
they
not
going
to
do
that
are
they
i
i
do
want
you
so
far
away
dear
dairy
i
am
unsuspicious
by
nature
believing
all
mankind
to
be
my
friends
until
proven
otherwise
but
there
was
a
gloating
look
in
carter
brooks
eyes
as
they
turned
on
me
carter
i
said
you
know
where
he
is
and
you
will
not
tell
me
you
wish
to
ruin
him
i
was
about
to
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
but
he
drew
away
look
here
he
said
i
tell
you
something
but
please
keep
back
because
you
look
like
smallpox
to
me
i
was
at
the
mill
this
morning
i
do
not
know
anything
about
your
he
probably
only
been
run
over
or
something
but
i
saw
beresford
going
in
and
i
well
i
suggested
that
he
better
walk
in
on
your
father
or
he
would
get
in
it
worked
bab
how
it
did
work
he
went
in
and
said
he
had
come
to
ask
your
father
for
something
and
your
father
blew
up
by
saying
that
he
knew
about
it
but
that
the
world
only
owed
a
living
to
the
man
who
would
hustle
for
it
and
that
he
would
not
be
forced
to
take
any
one
he
did
not
want
and
in
two
minutes
beresford
hit
him
and
got
a
response
it
was
a
million
dollars
worth
so
he
babbled
on
but
what
were
his
words
to
me
dear
diary
i
gave
no
thought
to
the
smallpox
he
had
mentioned
although
fatal
to
the
complexion
or
to
the
fight
at
the
mill
i
heard
only
adrian
possible
tragic
fate
suddenly
i
collapsed
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
feeling
horrible
very
wobbly
and
unable
to
keep
my
knees
from
bending
and
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
father
taking
me
home
and
fate
still
a
deep
mystery
and
remaining
such
while
i
had
a
warm
sponge
to
bring
out
the
rest
of
the
rash
followed
by
a
sleep
it
being
measles
and
not
smallpox
oh
dear
diary
what
a
story
i
learned
when
having
wakened
and
feeling
better
my
father
came
tonight
and
talked
to
me
from
the
doorway
not
being
allowed
in
adrian
had
gone
to
the
mill
and
father
having
thrown
beresford
out
and
asserted
his
principals
had
not
thrown
him
out
but
had
given
him
a
job
in
the
mill
and
the
policeman
had
given
him
no
chance
to
escape
which
he
attempted
he
was
dragged
to
the
shell
plant
and
there
locked
in
because
of
spies
the
plant
is
under
military
guard
and
there
he
had
been
compelled
to
drag
a
wheelbarrow
back
and
forth
containing
charcoal
for
a
small
furnace
for
hours
even
when
carter
found
him
he
could
not
be
released
as
father
was
in
hiding
from
reporters
and
would
not
go
to
the
telephone
or
see
callers
he
labored
until
while
the
theater
remained
dark
and
people
got
their
money
back
i
have
ruined
him
i
have
also
ruined
miss
everett
cousin
the
nurse
is
still
asleep
i
think
i
will
enter
a
hospital
my
career
is
ended
my
life
is
blasted
i
reach
under
the
mattress
and
draw
out
the
picture
of
him
who
today
i
have
ruined
compelling
him
to
do
manual
labor
for
hours
although
unaccustomed
to
it
he
is
a
great
actor
and
i
believe
has
a
future
but
my
love
for
him
is
dead
dear
diary
he
deceived
me
and
that
is
one
thing
i
can
not
forgive
so
now
i
sit
here
among
my
pillows
while
the
nurse
sleeps
and
i
reflect
about
many
things
but
one
speech
rings
in
my
ears
over
and
over
carter
brooks
on
learning
about
switzerland
said
it
in
a
strange
manner
looking
at
me
with
inscrutable
eyes
switzerland
why
bab
i
do
want
you
to
go
so
far
away
what
did
he
mean
by
it
dear
dairy
you
will
have
to
be
burned
i
daresay
perhaps
it
is
as
well
i
have
p
o
r
e
d
out
my
