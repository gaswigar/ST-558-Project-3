celia
myself
little
george
carew
flushed
and
excited
crossed
the
pantry
as
she
spoke
and
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
that
connected
it
with
the
kitchen
she
was
a
pretty
woman
even
now
when
her
hair
already
dressed
was
hidden
under
snugly
pinned
veils
and
her
trim
little
figure
lost
under
a
flying
kimono
carew
was
expecting
the
members
of
the
santa
paloma
bridge
club
on
this
particular
evening
and
now
at
three
on
a
beautiful
april
afternoon
she
was
almost
frantic
with
fatigue
and
nervousness
the
house
had
been
cleaned
thoroughly
the
day
before
rugs
shaken
mirrors
polished
floors
oiled
the
grand
piano
had
been
closed
and
pushed
against
the
wall
the
had
been
cleared
and
wheeled
out
under
the
turn
of
the
stairway
the
pretty
and
square
big
entrance
hall
had
been
emptied
to
make
room
for
the
seven
little
that
were
already
set
up
and
for
the
chairs
that
carew
had
collected
from
the
the
bedrooms
the
halls
and
even
the
nursery
for
the
occasion
all
this
had
been
done
the
day
before
and
carew
awakening
early
in
the
morning
to
uneasy
anticipations
of
a
full
day
had
yet
felt
that
the
main
work
of
preparation
was
out
of
the
way
but
now
in
nothing
seemed
done
there
were
flowers
still
to
arrange
there
was
the
mild
punch
that
santa
paloma
affected
at
card
parties
to
be
finished
there
was
candy
to
be
put
about
on
the
tables
in
little
silver
dishes
and
new
packs
of
cards
and
pencils
and
to
be
scattered
about
and
in
the
kitchen
but
carew
heart
failed
at
the
thought
true
her
own
two
maids
were
being
helped
out
by
binney
from
the
village
a
tower
of
strength
in
an
emergency
and
by
lizzie
binney
a
worthy
daughter
of
her
mother
but
there
had
been
so
many
stupid
delays
and
plates
and
glasses
and
and
silver
and
napkins
for
meant
such
a
lot
of
counting
and
sorting
and
polishing
and
somehow
george
and
the
children
must
have
dinner
and
the
binneys
and
celia
and
annie
must
eat
too
well
thought
carew
with
a
desperate
glance
at
the
kitchen
clock
it
will
all
be
over
pretty
soon
thank
goodness
a
pleasant
stir
of
preparation
pervaded
the
kitchen
binney
enormous
capable
was
opening
crabs
at
one
end
of
the
table
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
her
gingham
dress
in
the
last
stage
of
age
and
thinness
protected
by
a
new
stiff
white
apron
celia
carew
cook
was
sitting
opposite
her
dismembering
two
cold
roasted
fowls
lizzie
binney
as
trim
and
pretty
as
her
mother
was
shapeless
and
plain
was
filling
silver
with
salted
nuts
how
is
everything
going
celia
said
carew
sampling
a
nut
fine
said
celia
placidly
he
did
bring
but
two
bunches
of
sullery
so
i
do
know
will
i
have
enough
for
the
salad
they
sent
the
cherries
and
binney
wants
you
should
taste
the
punch
it
sweet
now
said
binney
as
carew
picked
up
the
big
but
there
the
ice
to
go
in
delicious
not
one
bit
too
sweet
carew
pronounced
you
know
that
to
be
passed
around
in
the
little
glasses
lizzie
while
playing
and
a
cherry
and
a
piece
of
pineapple
in
every
glass
did
annie
find
the
doilies
for
the
big
trays
yes
i
got
the
bowl
down
annie
going
to
wash
it
oh
the
cakes
came
did
they
that
good
and
the
cream
for
coffee
that
ought
to
go
right
on
ice
i
telephone
for
more
celery
there
some
of
these
napkins
so
mussed
laying
in
the
drawer
said
lizzie
i
thought
i
put
a
couple
of
irons
on
and
press
them
out
if
you
have
time
i
wish
you
would
carew
said
touching
the
frosted
top
of
an
with
a
tentative
finger
i
may
have
to
play
celia
she
went
on
to
her
own
cook
but
you
girls
can
manage
everything
ca
you
dinner
really
does
matter
scrambled
eggs
and
baked
potatoes
something
like
that
and
you
have
to
serve
it
on
the
side
porch
oh
yes
we
manage
celia
assured
her
confidently
we
clear
up
here
pretty
soon
and
then
there
nothing
but
the
sandwiches
to
do
carew
went
on
her
way
comforted
celia
was
not
a
fancy
cook
she
reflected
passing
through
the
darkened
where
the
long
table
had
been
already
set
with
a
shining
cloth
and
where
silver
and
glass
gleamed
in
the
darkness
but
celia
was
reliable
and
for
a
woman
with
three
children
a
large
house
and
but
one
other
maid
celia
was
a
treasure
she
telephoned
the
grocer
her
eyes
roving
critically
over
the
hall
as
she
did
so
the
buttercups
in
a
great
bowl
on
the
table
were
already
dropping
their
varnished
yellow
leaves
annie
must
brush
those
up
the
very
last
thing
so
far
so
good
said
carew
straightening
the
rug
at
the
door
with
a
small
heel
and
dropping
wearily
into
a
porch
rocker
there
must
be
one
thousand
things
i
ought
to
be
doing
she
said
resting
her
head
and
shutting
her
eyes
it
was
a
warm
delicious
afternoon
the
little
california
town
lay
asleep
under
a
haze
of
golden
sunshine
the
carews
pretty
house
with
its
lawn
and
garden
was
almost
the
last
on
river
street
and
stood
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
that
commanded
all
santa
paloma
valley
below
it
the
wide
street
descended
between
other
unfenced
lawns
and
other
handsome
homes
this
was
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
town
the
willard
whites
immense
colonial
mansion
was
here
and
the
whites
rich
handsome
childless
clever
and
nearing
the
forties
were
quite
the
most
prominent
people
of
santa
paloma
the
wayne
adamses
charming
extravagant
young
people
lived
near
and
the
parker
lloyds
who
were
suspected
of
hiding
rather
serious
money
troubles
under
their
reckless
hospitality
and
unfailing
gaiety
were
just
across
the
street
on
river
street
too
lived
dignified
aristocratic
old
apostleman
and
nervous
timid
anne
pratt
and
her
brother
walter
whose
gloomy
stately
old
mansion
was
one
of
the
finest
in
town
up
at
the
end
of
the
street
were
the
carews
and
the
shabby
comfortable
home
of
and
brown
and
the
neglected
white
cottage
where
barry
valentine
and
his
little
son
billy
and
a
studious
young
japanese
servant
led
a
rather
shiftless
existence
and
although
there
were
other
pretty
streets
in
town
and
other
pleasant
women
who
were
members
of
church
and
club
river
street
was
unquestionably
the
street
and
its
residents
unquestionably
the
people
of
santa
paloma
beyond
these
homes
lay
the
business
part
of
the
town
the
railway
station
and
the
library
and
the
women
clubhouse
with
its
red
geraniums
roof
and
plaster
arches
and
beyond
again
were
blocks
of
business
buildings
handsome
and
modern
with
elevators
and
tiled
vestibules
and
heavy
windows
on
the
street
there
was
a
drug
store
quite
modern
enough
to
be
facing
upon
street
and
broadway
instead
of
the
peace
of
santa
paloma
main
street
at
its
cool
and
glittering
fountain
indeed
a
hundred
drinks
could
be
mixed
of
which
broadway
never
even
heard
and
on
broadway
three
thousand
miles
away
the
women
who
shopped
were
buying
the
same
boxed
powders
the
same
bottled
toilet
waters
the
same
patented
soaps
and
brushes
and
candies
that
were
to
be
found
here
and
in
the
immense
grocery
store
nearby
there
were
beautifully
spacious
departments
worthy
of
any
great
city
devoted
to
rare
fruits
and
coffees
and
teas
and
every
pickle
that
ever
came
in
a
glass
bottle
and
every
little
spiced
fish
that
ever
came
in
a
gay
tin
a
young
man
demonstrated
a
a
young
woman
demonstrated
nearby
were
the
one
or
two
big
stores
with
lovely
gowns
in
their
windows
and
milliners
shops
with
french
hats
in
their
smart
paris
boxes
there
was
even
a
very
tiny
very
elegant
little
shop
where
pastes
and
powders
and
shampooing
were
the
attraction
a
shop
that
had
a
french
name
et
cie
over
the
door
in
short
there
were
modern
women
and
rich
women
in
santa
paloma
as
these
things
unmistakably
indicated
where
sixty
years
ago
there
had
been
but
a
lonely
outpost
on
a
spanish
and
where
thirty
years
after
that
there
was
only
a
general
store
at
a
crossroads
now
every
luxury
in
the
world
might
be
had
for
the
asking
all
this
part
of
the
town
lay
northeast
of
the
sleepy
little
lobos
river
which
cut
santa
paloma
in
two
it
was
a
pretty
river
a
boiling
yellow
torrent
in
winter
but
low
enough
in
the
for
the
children
to
wade
across
the
shallows
and
shaded
all
along
its
course
by
overhanging
maples
and
willows
and
oaktrees
and
an
undergrowth
of
wild
currant
and
hazel
bushes
and
blackberry
vines
across
the
river
was
old
paloma
where
dust
from
the
cannery
chimneys
and
soot
from
the
railway
sheds
powdered
an
ugly
shabby
settlement
of
shanties
and
cheap
old
paloma
was
peppered
thick
with
saloons
and
flavored
by
them
and
by
the
odor
of
frying
grease
and
by
an
ashy
waste
known
as
the
dump
over
all
other
odors
lay
the
sweet
cloying
smell
of
crushed
grapes
from
the
winery
and
the
pungent
odor
from
the
tannery
of
white
company
the
men
and
boys
and
girls
of
the
settlement
all
worked
in
one
or
another
of
these
places
and
the
women
gossiped
in
their
untidy
doorways
above
the
carew
house
and
doctor
brown
opposite
river
street
came
perforce
to
an
end
for
it
was
crossed
at
this
point
by
an
wooden
fence
of
slender
rounded
pickets
in
the
middle
of
the
fence
was
a
wide
carriage
gate
with
a
smaller
gate
for
foot
passengers
at
each
side
and
beyond
it
the
shabby
neglected
garden
and
the
tangle
of
pepper
and
eucalyptus
and
weeping
willow
trees
that
half
hid
the
old
holly
mansion
once
this
had
been
the
great
house
of
the
village
but
now
it
was
empty
and
forlorn
captain
holly
had
been
dead
for
five
or
six
years
and
the
last
of
the
sons
and
daughters
had
gone
away
into
the
world
the
house
furnished
just
as
they
had
left
it
was
for
sale
but
the
years
went
by
and
no
buyer
appeared
and
meantime
the
garden
flowers
ran
wild
the
lawns
were
dry
and
brown
and
the
fence
was
smothered
in
coarse
rose
vines
and
rampant
wild
blackberry
vines
dry
grass
and
yarrow
and
hollow
milkweed
grew
high
in
the
gateways
and
when
the
village
children
went
through
them
to
prowl
as
children
love
to
prowl
about
the
neglected
house
and
orchard
they
left
long
dusty
wakes
in
the
crushed
weeds
further
up
than
the
children
usually
ventured
there
was
an
old
bridge
across
the
lobos
captain
holly
private
road
to
the
mill
town
but
it
was
boarded
across
now
and
hundreds
of
chipmunks
nested
in
it
and
whisked
about
it
undisturbed
the
great
stables
and
barns
stood
empty
the
fountains
were
long
gone
dry
only
the
orchard
continued
to
bear
heavily
the
holly
estate
ran
up
into
the
hill
behind
it
one
of
the
wooded
foothills
that
encircled
all
santa
paloma
as
they
encircle
so
many
california
towns
already
turning
brown
and
crowned
with
dense
low
groves
of
oak
and
bay
and
madrona
trees
they
shut
off
the
world
outside
although
sometimes
on
a
still
day
the
solemn
booming
of
the
ocean
could
be
heard
beyond
them
and
a
hundred
times
a
year
the
pacific
fogs
came
creeping
over
them
long
before
dawn
and
santa
paloma
awakened
in
an
enveloping
cloud
of
soft
mist
here
and
there
the
slopes
of
these
hills
were
checkered
with
the
sharp
oblongs
and
angles
of
young
vineyards
and
hidden
by
the
thickening
green
of
peach
and
apple
orchards
a
few
low
brown
dairy
were
perched
high
on
the
ridges
the
moving
stream
of
the
cattle
in
could
be
seen
from
the
village
on
a
clear
day
and
over
hill
and
valley
on
this
wonderful
afternoon
in
late
spring
the
most
generous
sunlight
in
the
world
lay
warm
and
golden
and
across
them
the
shadows
of
high
clouds
for
there
had
been
rain
in
the
night
traveled
slowly
i
declare
said
little
carew
lazily
i
could
go
to
sleep
chapter
ii
a
moment
later
when
a
tall
man
came
up
the
path
and
dropped
on
the
top
porch
step
with
an
air
of
being
entirely
at
home
carew
was
still
dreaming
and
hello
jeanette
said
the
newcomer
what
new
with
thee
coz
do
smoke
there
barry
and
get
things
mussy
said
carew
in
return
smiling
to
soften
the
command
and
to
show
barry
valentine
that
he
was
welcome
barry
was
usually
welcome
everywhere
although
not
at
all
approved
in
many
cases
and
criticised
even
by
the
people
who
liked
him
best
he
was
a
sort
of
fourth
cousin
of
carew
who
sometimes
felt
herself
called
to
the
difficult
task
of
defending
him
because
of
the
distant
kinship
he
was
very
handsome
lean
and
dark
with
a
sleepy
smile
and
with
eyes
that
all
children
loved
and
he
was
clever
or
at
least
everyone
believed
him
to
be
so
and
he
had
charm
a
charm
of
sheer
sweetness
for
he
never
seemed
to
be
particularly
anxious
to
please
barry
was
very
gallant
in
an
impersonal
sort
of
way
he
took
a
keen
sort
of
interest
in
every
pretty
girl
in
the
village
and
liked
to
discuss
their
own
love
affairs
with
them
with
a
seriousness
quite
paternal
he
never
singled
any
girl
out
for
particular
attention
or
escorted
one
unless
asked
but
he
was
flatteringly
attentive
to
all
the
people
of
his
acquaintance
and
his
big
helpful
hand
was
always
ready
for
stumbling
old
women
on
the
church
steps
or
tearful
waifs
in
the
street
he
always
had
time
to
listen
to
other
people
troubles
barry
everyone
admitted
had
his
points
but
after
all
after
all
he
was
lazy
and
shiftless
and
unambitious
he
was
content
to
be
assistant
editor
of
the
mail
content
to
be
bullied
and
belittled
by
old
rogers
content
to
go
on
his
own
idle
sunny
way
playing
with
his
small
chubby
son
foraging
the
woods
with
a
dozen
small
boys
at
his
heels
working
patiently
over
a
broken
or
a
rusty
shotgun
for
some
small
admirer
worst
of
all
barry
had
been
intemperate
years
ago
and
there
were
people
who
believed
that
his
occasional
visits
to
san
francisco
now
were
merely
excuses
for
revels
with
his
old
newspaper
friends
there
and
yet
he
had
been
such
a
brilliant
such
a
fiery
and
ambitious
boy
all
santa
paloma
had
taken
pride
in
the
fact
that
barry
valentine
only
twenty
had
been
offered
the
editorship
of
the
one
newspaper
of
plumas
a
little
town
some
twelve
miles
away
and
had
prophesied
a
triumphant
progress
for
him
to
the
newspapers
of
san
francisco
of
chicago
of
new
york
but
barry
had
not
been
long
in
plumas
when
he
suddenly
married
miss
hetty
scott
of
that
town
and
in
the
twelve
years
that
had
passed
since
then
the
golden
dreams
for
his
future
had
vanished
one
by
one
until
found
him
with
no
one
to
believe
in
him
not
even
himself
hetty
scott
was
but
seventeen
when
barry
met
her
and
already
the
winner
in
two
village
contests
for
beauty
and
popularity
after
their
marriage
she
and
barry
went
to
san
francisco
and
shrewd
little
beautiful
hetty
found
herself
more
admired
than
ever
and
began
to
talk
of
the
stage
after
that
santa
paloma
heard
only
occasional
rumors
barry
had
a
position
on
a
new
york
paper
and
hetty
was
studying
in
a
dramatic
school
there
was
a
baby
there
were
financial
troubles
and
barry
was
drinking
again
then
hetty
was
dead
and
barry
fearing
the
severe
eastern
winters
for
the
delicate
baby
was
coming
back
to
santa
paloma
so
back
they
came
and
there
had
been
no
indication
since
that
the
restless
ambitious
barry
of
years
ago
was
not
dead
forever
no
smoking
said
barry
now
that
so
you
got
some
sort
of
jinks
on
for
have
you
i
brought
up
those
hinges
for
your
mixing
table
jen
he
went
on
but
any
time
will
do
i
suppose
the
kitchen
is
right
on
the
fault
as
it
were
the
kitchen
does
look
earthquakey
admitted
carew
with
a
laugh
but
the
girls
would
be
glad
to
have
the
extra
table
so
go
right
ahead
i
take
you
out
in
a
second
i
have
been
on
the
go
she
added
wearily
since
seven
this
morning
my
feet
are
like
balls
of
fire
you
do
know
what
the
details
are
why
just
tying
up
the
prizes
takes
a
good
hour
anything
go
wrong
asked
the
man
sympathetically
oh
no
nothing
particular
but
you
know
how
a
house
has
to
look
even
the
bathrooms
and
our
room
and
the
spare
room
the
children
do
get
things
so
mussed
it
all
sounds
so
simple
but
it
takes
such
a
time
well
annie
does
she
do
these
things
oh
ordinarily
she
does
but
she
was
sweeping
all
morning
we
moved
things
about
so
last
night
and
there
was
china
and
glasses
to
get
down
and
the
porches
but
jeanette
said
barry
valentine
patiently
do
you
keep
this
house
clean
enough
ordinarily
without
these
orgies
of
cleaning
the
minute
anybody
comes
in
i
never
knew
such
a
house
for
women
to
open
windows
and
tie
up
curtains
and
put
towels
over
their
hair
and
run
around
with
buckets
of
cold
suds
why
this
extra
fuss
well
it
not
all
cleaning
said
carew
a
little
annoyed
largely
supper
and
i
not
giving
anything
like
the
suppers
white
and
adams
give
why
do
they
eat
at
home
said
valentine
hospitably
what
do
they
come
for
anyway
to
see
the
house
or
each
other
clothes
or
to
eat
women
are
funny
at
a
card
party
he
went
on
always
ready
to
expand
an
argument
comfortably
it
takes
them
an
hour
to
settle
down
and
see
how
everyone
else
looks
and
whether
there
happens
to
be
a
streak
of
dust
under
the
piano
and
then
when
the
game
is
just
well
started
a
maid
is
nudging
you
in
the
elbow
to
take
a
plate
of
hot
chicken
and
another
on
the
other
side
is
holding
out
sandwiches
and
all
the
women
are
running
to
look
at
the
prizes
now
when
men
play
cards
oh
barry
do
get
started
his
cousin
impatiently
implored
too
tired
to
listen
come
out
and
fix
the
table
wish
i
could
really
help
you
said
barry
as
they
crossed
the
hall
and
as
a
further
attempt
to
soothe
her
ruffled
feelings
he
added
amiably
the
place
looks
fine
the
buttercups
came
up
did
they
beautifully
you
were
a
dear
to
get
them
said
carew
quite
mollified
welcomed
openly
by
all
four
maids
barry
was
soon
contentedly
busy
with
screws
and
in
a
corner
of
the
sunny
kitchen
he
and
binney
immediately
entered
upon
a
spirited
discussion
of
equal
suffrage
to
the
intense
amusement
of
the
others
who
kept
him
supplied
with
sandwiches
cake
and
various
other
dainties
the
little
piece
of
work
was
presently
finished
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
everyone
and
barry
had
pocketed
his
tools
and
was
ready
to
go
when
carew
returned
to
the
kitchen
with
news
barry
said
she
closing
the
door
behind
her
george
is
here
well
george
has
a
right
here
said
barry
as
the
lady
cast
a
cautious
glance
over
her
shoulder
but
listen
his
cousin
said
excitedly
he
thinks
he
has
sold
the
holly
house
gee
whiz
said
barry
simply
to
a
burgoyne
rushed
on
carew
she
out
there
with
george
on
the
porch
now
a
widow
with
two
children
and
she
looks
so
sweet
she
knows
the
hollys
oh
barry
if
she
only
takes
it
such
a
dandy
commission
for
george
he
terribly
excited
himself
i
can
tell
by
the
calm
bored
way
she
talking
about
it
who
is
she
where
she
come
from
demanded
barry
from
new
york
her
father
died
last
year
in
washington
i
think
she
said
and
she
wants
to
live
quietly
somewhere
with
the
children
barry
will
you
be
an
angel
eventually
i
hope
to
said
valentine
grinning
but
she
did
not
hear
him
could
you
would
you
take
her
over
the
place
this
afternoon
barry
she
seems
sure
she
wants
it
and
george
feels
he
must
get
back
to
the
office
to
see
tilden
you
know
he
going
to
sign
for
a
whole
floor
of
the
pratt
building
george
ca
keep
tilden
waiting
and
it
wo
be
a
bit
hard
for
you
barry
george
says
to
promise
her
anything
she
just
wants
to
see
about
bathrooms
and
so
on
will
you
barry
sure
i
will
said
the
obliging
barry
and
when
carew
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
go
upstairs
and
brush
up
a
little
he
accepted
the
delicate
reflection
upon
the
state
of
his
hair
and
hands
and
said
sure
again
chapter
iii
burgoyne
was
a
woman
about
years
old
with
a
quick
smile
like
a
child
and
blue
eyes
set
far
apart
with
a
little
lift
at
the
corners
that
under
level
heavy
brows
gave
a
suggestion
of
something
almost
oriental
to
her
face
she
was
dressed
simply
in
black
and
a
transparent
black
veil
falling
from
her
wide
hat
and
flung
back
framed
her
face
most
becomingly
in
square
crisp
folds
she
and
barry
presently
walked
up
river
street
in
the
mellow
afternoon
sunlight
and
through
the
old
wooden
gates
of
the
holly
grounds
on
every
side
were
great
sprays
of
overgrown
roses
dusty
and
choked
with
weeds
ragged
pepper
tassels
dragged
in
the
grass
and
where
the
path
lay
under
the
eucalyptus
trees
it
was
slippery
with
the
dry
leaves
bees
hummed
over
rank
poppies
and
tangled
honeysuckle
once
or
twice
a
hummingbird
came
through
the
garden
on
some
swift
whizzing
journey
and
there
were
other
birds
in
the
trees
little
shy
brown
birds
silent
but
busy
in
the
late
afternoon
close
to
the
house
an
old
garden
faucet
dripped
and
dripped
and
a
noisy
changing
group
of
the
brown
birds
were
bathing
and
flashing
about
it
the
old
hall
stood
on
a
rise
of
ground
clear
of
the
trees
and
bathed
in
sunshine
it
was
an
ugly
house
following
as
it
did
the
fashion
of
the
late
seventies
but
it
was
not
undignified
with
its
big
door
flanked
by
and
its
narrow
porch
bounded
by
a
fat
wooden
balustrade
and
heavy
columns
the
porch
and
steps
were
and
faded
and
littered
now
with
fallen
leaves
and
twigs
barry
opened
the
front
door
with
some
difficulty
and
they
stepped
into
the
musty
emptiness
of
the
big
main
hall
there
was
a
stairway
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
a
colored
glass
window
on
the
landing
and
through
it
the
sunlight
streamed
showing
the
old
velvet
carpet
in
the
hall
below
and
the
carved
heavy
walnut
chairs
and
tables
and
the
old
engravings
in
their
frames
of
oak
and
walnut
mosaic
the
visitors
peeped
into
the
old
library
odorous
of
unopened
books
and
with
great
curtains
of
green
rep
shutting
out
the
light
and
into
the
music
room
behind
it
cold
even
on
this
warm
day
with
a
muffled
grand
piano
drawn
free
of
the
walls
and
near
it
two
upholstered
in
rep
to
match
the
curtains
and
chairs
they
went
across
the
hall
to
the
long
dim
drawing
room
where
there
was
another
velvet
carpet
dulled
to
a
red
pink
by
time
and
muffled
pompous
sofas
and
chairs
and
great
mirrors
and
sets
of
candlesticks
and
vases
on
the
mantels
and
the
windows
were
shuttered
here
the
air
lifeless
barry
in
george
carew
interest
felt
bound
to
say
that
they
would
clear
all
this
up
you
know
a
lot
of
this
stuff
could
be
stored
oh
why
store
it
it
perfectly
good
the
lady
answered
absently
presently
they
went
out
to
the
more
cheerful
which
ran
straight
across
the
house
and
was
with
pleasant
windows
on
two
sides
this
was
the
old
house
explained
barry
they
added
on
the
front
part
you
could
do
a
lot
with
this
room
do
you
still
smell
spice
and
apples
and
cider
here
said
burgoyne
turning
from
an
investigation
of
the
with
a
radiant
face
a
moment
later
she
caught
her
breath
suddenly
and
walked
across
the
room
to
stand
resting
her
hands
on
a
chair
back
before
a
large
portrait
that
hung
above
the
fireplace
she
stood
so
gazing
at
the
picture
the
portrait
of
a
woman
for
a
full
minute
and
when
she
turned
again
to
barry
her
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
that
holly
said
she
emily
said
that
picture
was
here
and
turning
back
to
the
canvas
she
added
under
her
breath
you
darling
did
you
know
her
barry
asked
surprised
did
i
know
her
burgoyne
echoed
softly
without
turning
yes
i
knew
her
she
added
almost
musingly
and
then
suddenly
she
said
come
let
look
upstairs
and
led
the
way
by
the
twisted
sunny
back
stairway
which
had
a
window
on
every
landing
and
crimson
rambler
roses
pressing
against
every
window
they
looked
into
several
bedrooms
all
dusty
close
sunshiny
in
the
largest
of
these
a
big
front
corner
room
carpeted
in
dark
red
with
a
black
marble
fireplace
and
an
immense
walnut
bed
burgoyne
looking
through
a
window
that
she
had
opened
upon
the
lovely
panorama
of
river
and
woods
said
suddenly
this
must
be
my
room
it
was
hers
she
was
the
best
friend
in
one
way
that
i
ever
had
holly
how
happy
i
was
here
here
barry
echoed
at
his
tone
she
turned
and
looked
keenly
at
him
a
little
smile
playing
about
her
lips
then
her
face
suddenly
brightened
barry
of
course
she
exclaimed
i
knew
i
knew
you
but
the
valentine
confused
me
and
facing
him
radiantly
she
demanded
who
am
i
barry
shook
his
head
slowly
his
puzzled
smiling
eyes
on
hers
for
a
moment
they
faced
each
other
then
his
look
cleared
as
hers
had
done
and
their
hands
met
as
he
said
boyishly
well
i
will
be
hanged
jappy
frothingham
jappy
frothingham
she
echoed
joyously
but
i
have
heard
that
name
for
twenty
years
and
you
the
boy
whose
father
was
a
doctor
and
who
helped
us
build
our
indian
camp
and
who
had
the
frog
and
fell
off
the
roof
and
killed
the
rattlesnake
and
you
the
girl
from
washington
who
could
speak
french
and
who
put
that
stuff
on
my
freckles
and
would
let
drown
the
kittens
oh
yes
yes
she
said
and
their
hands
still
joined
they
laughed
like
happy
children
together
presently
more
gravely
she
told
him
a
little
of
herself
of
the
early
marriage
and
the
diplomat
husband
whose
career
was
so
cruelly
cut
short
by
years
of
hopeless
invalidism
then
had
come
her
illness
and
years
of
travel
with
him
and
now
she
and
the
little
girls
were
alone
and
in
return
barry
sketched
his
own
life
told
her
a
little
of
hetty
and
his
unhappy
days
in
new
york
and
of
the
boy
and
finally
of
the
mail
her
absorbed
attention
followed
him
from
point
to
point
and
you
say
that
this
rogers
owns
the
newspaper
she
asked
thoughtfully
when
the
mail
was
under
discussion
rogers
owns
it
that
the
trouble
nothing
goes
into
it
without
the
old
man
consent
barry
tested
the
spring
of
a
roller
shade
with
a
scowl
barnes
the
assistant
editor
he
had
before
me
threw
up
his
job
because
he
would
stand
having
his
stuff
cut
all
to
pieces
and
changed
to
suit
rogers
policies
he
went
on
as
burgoyne
eyes
demanded
more
detail
and
that
what
i
do
some
day
in
the
six
years
since
the
old
man
bought
it
the
circulation
has
fallen
off
about
half
we
do
get
any
we
not
paying
expenses
it
a
crime
too
for
it
a
good
paper
even
rogers
is
sick
of
it
now
he
sell
for
a
song
i
borrow
the
money
and
buy
it
if
it
were
for
the
presses
i
have
to
have
new
presses
everything
here
is
in
pretty
good
shape
he
finished
with
an
air
of
changing
the
subject
and
what
would
new
presses
cost
sidney
burgoyne
persisted
pausing
on
the
big
main
stairway
as
they
were
leaving
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
oh
i
do
know
barry
opened
the
front
door
again
and
they
stepped
out
to
the
porch
altogether
he
said
vaguely
snapping
dead
twigs
from
the
heavy
unpruned
growth
of
the
rose
vines
altogether
i
would
go
into
it
without
ten
thousand
five
for
the
new
presses
say
and
four
to
rogers
for
the
business
and
and
something
to
run
on
although
barry
interrupted
himself
with
a
vehemence
that
surprised
her
although
i
bet
that
the
old
mail
would
be
paying
her
own
rent
and
salaries
within
two
months
the
dispatch
does
amount
to
much
and
the
star
is
a
regular
back
number
he
stood
staring
gloomily
down
at
the
roofs
of
the
village
burgoyne
a
little
tired
had
seated
herself
on
the
top
step
i
wish
in
all
seriousness
you
tell
me
about
it
she
said
i
am
really
interested
if
i
buy
this
place
it
will
mean
that
we
come
here
to
stay
for
years
perhaps
and
i
have
some
money
i
want
to
invest
here
i
had
thought
of
real
estate
but
it
need
necessarily
be
that
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
you
really
ought
to
make
an
effort
to
buy
the
paper
barry
have
you
thought
of
getting
anyone
to
go
into
it
with
you
the
man
laughed
perhaps
a
little
embarrassed
never
here
really
i
went
to
walter
pratt
about
it
once
he
admitted
but
he
said
he
was
all
tied
up
some
of
the
fellows
down
in
san
francisco
might
have
come
in
but
lord
i
do
want
to
settle
here
i
hate
this
place
but
why
do
you
hate
it
her
honest
eyes
met
his
in
surprise
and
reproof
i
ca
understand
it
perhaps
because
i
thought
of
santa
paloma
as
a
sort
of
mecca
for
so
many
years
myself
my
visit
here
was
the
sweetest
and
simplest
experience
i
ever
had
in
my
life
you
see
i
had
a
wretchedly
artificial
childhood
i
used
to
read
of
country
homes
and
big
families
and
good
times
in
books
but
i
was
an
only
child
and
even
then
my
life
was
spoiled
by
senseless
formalities
and
conventions
i
remembered
all
these
years
the
simple
gowns
holly
used
to
wear
here
and
the
way
she
played
with
us
and
the
village
women
coming
in
for
tea
and
sewing
it
was
all
so
sane
and
so
sweet
our
coming
here
was
the
merest
chance
my
father
and
i
were
on
our
way
home
from
japan
you
know
and
he
suddenly
remembered
that
the
hollys
were
near
san
francisco
and
we
came
up
here
for
a
night
that
said
burgoyne
in
a
lower
tone
as
if
half
to
herself
that
was
twenty
years
ago
i
was
only
twelve
but
i
never
forgotten
it
fred
and
oliver
and
emily
and
i
had
our
supper
on
the
side
porch
and
afterward
they
played
in
the
garden
but
i
was
shy
i
had
never
played
and
holly
kept
me
beside
her
on
the
porch
and
talked
to
me
now
and
then
and
finally
she
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
like
to
i
wonder
my
heart
did
burst
with
joy
father
said
no
but
after
we
children
had
gone
to
bed
they
discussed
it
again
how
emily
and
i
prayed
and
after
a
while
fred
tiptoed
down
to
the
landing
and
came
up
jubilant
heard
mother
say
that
what
clothes
sidney
needed
could
be
bought
right
here
he
said
emily
began
to
laugh
and
i
to
cry
she
turned
her
back
on
barry
and
he
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
wet
eyes
took
up
the
conversation
himself
i
do
remember
her
very
well
he
said
a
boy
would
she
died
soon
after
that
summer
and
the
boys
went
off
to
school
yes
i
know
the
lady
said
thoughtfully
i
had
the
news
in
rome
a
hot
bright
glaring
day
it
was
nearly
a
month
after
her
death
then
and
even
then
i
said
to
myself
that
i
come
back
here
some
day
but
it
not
been
possible
until
now
and
now
her
voice
was
bright
and
steady
again
here
i
am
and
i
do
like
to
hear
an
old
friend
abusing
santa
paloma
it
a
nice
enough
place
barry
admitted
but
the
people
are
well
you
wait
until
you
meet
the
women
perhaps
they
not
much
worse
than
women
everywhere
else
but
sometimes
it
does
seem
as
if
the
women
here
had
good
sense
i
do
mean
the
nice
quiet
ones
who
live
out
on
the
ranches
and
are
bringing
up
a
houseful
of
children
but
this
river
street
crowd
why
what
the
matter
with
them
asked
burgoyne
with
vivacity
oh
i
mean
this
business
of
playing
bridge
four
afternoons
a
week
and
running
to
the
club
and
tearing
around
in
all
day
sunday
and
entertaining
the
way
they
think
people
do
it
in
new
york
and
getting
their
dresses
in
san
francisco
instead
of
up
here
barry
explained
disgustedly
some
of
them
would
be
nice
enough
if
they
were
trying
to
go
each
other
one
better
all
the
time
when
one
gets
a
thing
the
others
have
all
got
to
have
it
or
have
something
nicer
take
the
browns
now
your
neighbors
there
in
the
shingled
house
with
the
babies
swinging
on
the
gate
as
we
came
by
yes
that
it
they
got
four
little
boys
doctor
brown
is
a
king
everybody
worships
him
and
she
a
sweet
little
woman
but
of
course
she
got
to
strain
and
struggle
like
the
rest
of
them
there
a
willard
white
in
this
town
that
big
place
down
there
is
their
garage
and
she
runs
the
whole
place
she
always
letting
the
others
know
that
hobbles
are
out
and
everything
got
to
hang
from
the
shoulder
very
good
laughed
burgoyne
you
got
that
very
nearly
right
willard
white
a
nice
fellow
barry
went
on
except
that
he
a
little
cracked
about
his
packard
they
give
motoring
parties
and
of
course
they
stop
at
hotels
way
up
the
country
for
lunch
and
the
women
have
got
to
have
veils
and
special
hats
and
coats
and
so
on
wayne
adams
told
me
it
stood
him
in
about
thirty
dollars
every
time
he
went
out
with
the
whites
wayne
got
his
own
car
now
his
wife
kept
at
him
day
and
night
to
get
it
but
he
ca
run
it
so
it
in
the
garage
half
the
time
that
the
worst
of
motoring
said
the
lady
with
a
thoughtful
nod
the
people
who
sell
them
think
they
answered
you
when
they
say
you
do
run
it
economically
if
you
understood
it
it
cost
you
half
so
much
and
the
alternative
is
a
man
at
dollars
a
month
and
save
repairing
and
replacing
bills
nice
for
business
barry
but
very
much
overdone
for
pleasure
i
think
i
myself
hate
those
days
spent
with
five
people
you
hardly
know
she
went
on
rushing
over
beautiful
roads
that
you
hardly
see
eating
too
much
in
strange
hotels
and
paying
too
much
for
it
i
have
a
car
but
tell
me
more
about
the
people
who
are
the
adamses
did
you
say
adams
wayne
adams
nice
people
with
two
nice
boys
he
supplied
but
like
the
rest
wayne
lies
awake
nights
worrying
about
bills
and
she
gives
silver
for
bridge
prizes
that
white
stucco
house
where
they
putting
in
an
italian
garden
is
the
parker
lloyds
lloyd
a
clever
woman
and
pretty
too
but
she
does
seem
to
have
any
sense
they
got
a
little
girl
and
she
tell
you
that
mabel
never
wore
a
stitch
that
was
in
her
life
lloyd
had
a
nervous
breakdown
a
few
months
ago
we
all
knew
it
was
nothing
but
money
worry
but
yesterday
his
wife
said
to
me
in
all
good
faith
that
he
was
too
unselfish
he
was
wearing
himself
out
she
was
trying
to
persuade
him
to
put
mabel
in
school
and
go
abroad
for
a
good
rest
burgoyne
laughed
that
like
jeanette
carew
showing
me
her
birthday
present
barry
went
on
with
a
grin
it
seems
that
george
gave
her
a
complete
set
of
bureau
ivory
two
or
three
dozen
pieces
in
all
i
guess
when
i
asked
her
she
admitted
that
she
had
silver
but
she
said
she
wanted
ivory
everybody
has
ivory
now
present
he
repeated
with
scorn
why
she
just
told
george
what
she
wanted
and
went
down
and
charged
it
to
him
she
worried
to
death
about
bills
now
but
she
started
right
in
talking
and
they
have
one
yet
i
give
a
good
deal
he
finished
disgustedly
to
know
what
they
get
out
of
it
i
do
believe
they
as
bad
as
all
that
said
the
lady
there
used
to
be
some
lovely
people
here
and
there
was
a
whist
club
too
and
it
was
very
nice
they
played
for
a
silver
fork
and
spoon
every
fortnight
and
i
remember
that
holly
had
nearly
a
dozen
of
the
forks
there
was
a
darling
apostleman
and
pratt
with
two
shy
pretty
daughters
apostleman
still
here
he
told
her
she
a
fine
old
lady
when
a
woman
gets
to
be
sixty
it
does
seem
to
matter
if
she
wastes
time
pratt
is
dead
and
lizzie
is
married
and
lives
in
san
francisco
but
anne
still
here
she
and
her
brother
live
in
that
vault
of
a
gray
house
you
can
see
the
chimneys
anne
another
his
tone
was
cynical
again
a
shy
nervous
woman
always
getting
new
dresses
and
always
on
club
reception
committees
with
white
gloves
and
a
ribbon
in
her
hair
frightened
to
death
for
fear
she
not
doing
the
correct
thing
they
just
had
a
frieze
of
english
tapestries
put
in
the
and
hall
english
tapestries
perhaps
you
do
appreciate
tapestries
said
burgoyne
with
her
twinkling
smile
you
know
there
is
a
popular
theory
that
such
things
keep
money
in
circulation
you
know
there
hardly
any
form
of
foolishness
or
vice
of
which
you
ca
say
that
he
reminded
her
soberly
and
burgoyne
serious
in
turn
answered
quickly
yes
you
quite
right
it
too
bad
we
american
women
seem
somehow
to
have
let
go
of
everything
real
in
the
last
few
generations
but
things
are
coming
around
again
she
rose
from
the
steps
still
facing
the
village
tell
me
who
is
my
nearest
neighbor
there
in
the
white
cottage
she
demanded
i
am
barry
said
unexpectedly
so
if
you
need
yeast
is
it
that
women
always
borrow
yeast
she
assented
laughing
i
will
remember
and
now
tell
me
about
trains
and
things
listen
her
voice
and
look
changed
suddenly
softened
brightened
is
that
children
she
asked
eagerly
and
a
moment
later
four
children
tired
happy
and
laden
with
orchard
spoils
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
barry
presented
them
as
the
carews
george
and
jeanette
a
bashful
fourteen
and
a
twelve
and
dick
who
was
seven
and
his
own
small
dusty
son
billy
valentine
who
put
a
fat
confiding
hand
in
the
strange
lady
as
they
all
went
down
to
the
gate
together
you
are
my
joanna
age
jeanette
said
burgoyne
easily
i
hope
you
will
be
friends
who
will
i
be
friends
with
said
little
billy
raising
blue
expectant
eyes
and
who
will
george
why
i
hope
you
will
be
friends
with
me
she
answered
laughing
and
i
will
be
so
relieved
if
george
will
come
up
sometimes
and
help
me
with
bonfires
and
about
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
stable
you
see
i
do
know
much
about
those
things
at
this
moment
george
hoarsely
muttering
that
he
was
much
good
he
guessed
but
he
had
some
good
tools
fell
deeply
a
victim
to
her
charms
carew
came
out
of
her
own
gate
as
they
came
up
and
there
was
time
for
a
little
talk
and
promises
and
goodbyes
then
barry
took
burgoyne
to
the
station
and
lifted
his
hat
to
the
bright
face
at
the
window
as
the
train
pulled
out
in
the
dusk
he
went
slowly
to
his
office
from
the
train
and
attacked
the
litter
of
papers
and
clippings
on
his
desk
once
he
said
half
aloud
his
big
scissors
arrested
his
forehead
furrowed
by
an
unaccustomed
frown
we
were
only
kids
then
and
they
all
thought
i
was
the
one
who
was
going
to
do
something
big
chapter
iv
barry
appeared
at
carew
house
a
little
after
midnight
to
find
the
enjoying
a
successful
supper
and
the
one
topic
of
conversation
the
possible
sale
of
holly
hall
barry
suspected
of
having
news
of
it
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
tired
women
and
the
men
in
their
somewhat
rumpled
evening
clothes
and
supplied
with
salad
and
coffee
is
she
really
coming
barry
demanded
lloyd
eagerly
and
how
soon
we
have
been
saying
what
wonders
could
be
done
for
the
hall
with
a
little
money
the
price
did
seem
to
worry
her
said
george
carew
oh
she
coming
barry
assured
them
you
can
consider
it
settled
good
said
old
apostleman
in
her
deep
emphatic
voice
have
to
make
the
house
over
of
course
but
the
stable
ought
to
make
a
very
decent
garage
mark
my
words
me
dears
ye
see
some
very
startling
changes
up
there
before
the
summer
out
the
house
could
be
made
colonial
submitted
adams
or
mission
for
that
matter
no
you
could
make
it
mission
willard
white
decided
and
several
voices
murmured
no
you
could
do
that
but
colonial
it
would
be
charming
the
authority
went
on
personally
i
tear
the
whole
thing
down
and
rebuild
said
white
further
but
with
hardwood
floors
throughout
tapestry
papers
or
the
new
grass
papers
like
amy
library
will
white
paint
on
all
the
woodwork
white
and
cream
outside
some
really
good
furniture
and
the
garden
made
over
you
would
know
the
place
but
that
would
take
months
said
carew
ruefully
and
cost
like
sixty
added
brown
at
which
there
was
a
laugh
well
she
wo
wait
any
six
months
or
six
weeks
either
barry
predicted
and
do
you
worry
about
the
expense
doctor
do
you
know
who
she
is
they
all
looked
at
him
who
said
ten
voices
together
why
her
father
was
frothingham
paul
frothingham
the
inventor
her
husband
was
colonel
john
burgoyne
you
all
know
the
name
he
was
quite
a
big
man
too
a
diplomat
their
wedding
was
one
of
those
big
washington
affairs
a
few
years
later
burgoyne
had
an
accident
and
he
was
an
invalid
for
about
six
years
after
that
until
his
death
in
fact
she
traveled
with
him
everywhere
sidney
frothingham
said
carew
i
remember
emily
holly
used
to
have
letters
from
her
she
was
presented
at
the
english
court
when
she
was
quite
young
i
remember
and
she
used
to
visit
at
the
white
house
too
so
that
who
she
is
i
remember
the
child
visit
here
perfectly
apostleman
said
tall
lanky
girl
with
very
charming
manners
her
husband
was
at
petersburg
for
a
while
then
in
london
was
it
you
ought
to
know
clara
me
dear
i
not
sure
even
after
his
accident
they
went
on
some
sort
of
diplomatic
mission
to
madrid
or
stockholm
or
somewhere
remember
it
perfectly
colonel
burgoyne
must
have
had
money
said
white
tentatively
some
i
think
barry
answered
but
it
was
her
father
who
was
rich
of
course
certainly
approved
apostleman
fanning
herself
majestically
rich
as
croesus
heavens
alive
said
lloyd
unaffectedly
yes
willard
white
eyed
the
tip
of
a
cigar
thoughtfully
yes
i
remember
he
worked
his
own
patents
had
his
own
factories
paul
frothingham
must
have
left
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
well
two
or
three
millions
two
or
three
echoed
apostleman
in
regal
scorn
make
it
eight
eight
said
brown
faintly
well
that
would
be
about
my
estimate
barry
agreed
he
was
a
big
man
frothingham
brown
said
reflectively
well
well
ladies
here
a
chance
for
santa
paloma
to
put
her
best
foot
forward
what
wo
she
do
to
the
hall
adams
remarked
carew
sighed
it
it
rather
staggers
one
to
think
of
trying
to
entertain
a
woman
worth
eight
millions
does
it
said
she
chapter
v
from
the
moment
of
her
arrival
in
santa
paloma
when
she
stood
on
the
station
platform
with
a
brisk
spring
wind
blowing
her
veil
about
her
face
and
a
small
and
chattering
girl
on
each
side
of
her
burgoyne
seemed
inclined
to
meet
the
friendly
overtures
of
her
new
neighbors
more
than
she
remembered
the
name
from
her
visit
two
weeks
before
thank
roberts
for
his
trouble
ellen
and
met
the
aged
driver
of
the
one
available
carriage
with
a
ready
good
afternoon
mr
rivers
within
a
week
she
had
her
pew
in
church
her
box
at
the
her
membership
in
the
library
and
a
definite
rumor
was
afloat
to
the
effect
that
she
had
invested
several
thousand
dollars
in
the
mail
and
that
barry
valentine
had
bought
the
paper
from
old
rogers
outright
and
had
ordered
new
rotary
presses
and
was
at
last
to
have
a
free
hand
as
managing
editor
the
pretty
young
mistress
of
holly
hall
with
her
two
children
dancing
beside
her
and
her
ready
pleased
flush
and
greeting
for
new
friends
became
a
familiar
figure
in
santa
paloma
streets
she
was
even
seen
once
or
twice
across
the
river
in
the
mill
colony
having
for
some
mysterious
reason
immediately
opened
the
bridge
that
led
from
her
own
grounds
to
that
unsavory
region
she
was
not
formal
not
unapproachable
as
it
had
been
feared
she
might
be
on
the
contrary
she
was
curiously
democratic
and
for
a
woman
straight
from
the
shops
of
paris
and
new
york
her
clothes
seemed
to
the
women
of
santa
paloma
to
be
surprising
too
she
and
her
daughters
wore
plain
ginghams
for
every
day
with
plain
wide
hats
and
trim
serge
coats
for
foggy
mornings
and
on
sundays
it
was
certainly
extraordinary
to
meet
the
burgoynes
bound
for
church
wearing
the
simplest
of
dimity
or
muslin
wash
dresses
with
black
stockings
and
shoes
and
hats
as
plain
far
plainer
as
those
of
the
smallest
children
except
for
the
amazing
emeralds
that
blazed
beside
her
wedding
ring
and
the
diamonds
she
sometimes
wore
burgoyne
might
have
been
a
trained
nurse
in
uniform
it
is
a
pose
said
willard
white
at
the
club
to
a
few
intimate
friends
she
probably
imitating
some
english
countess
englishwomen
affect
simplicity
in
the
country
but
wait
until
we
see
her
evening
frocks
it
was
felt
that
any
formal
calling
upon
burgoyne
must
wait
until
the
supposedly
inevitable
session
with
carpenters
painters
upholsterers
decorators
furniture

and

was
over
at
the
hall
but
although
the
old
house
had
been
painted
and
the
plumbing
overhauled
before
the
new
arrival
and
although
all
day
long
and
every
day
two
or
three
portuguese
chopped
and
pruned
and
shouted
in
the
garden
a
week
and
then
two
weeks
slipped
by
and
no
further
evidences
of
renovation
were
to
be
seen
so
presently
callers
began
to
go
up
to
the
hall
first
apostleman
and
white
as
was
fitting
and
then
a
score
of
other
women
apostleman
had
been
the
social
leader
in
santa
paloma
when
white
was
little
clara
peck
a
pretty
girl
in
the
high
school
whose
rich
widowed
mother
dressed
her
exquisitely
and
who
was
studying
french
and
could
play
the
violin
but
apostleman
was
an
old
woman
now
and
had
been
playing
the
game
a
long
time
and
she
was
glad
to
put
the
sceptre
into
younger
hands
and
she
could
have
put
it
into
none
more
competent
than
those
of
willard
white
white
was
a
handsome
clever
woman
of
perhaps
she
had
been
married
now
for
seventeen
years
and
for
all
that
time
and
even
before
her
marriage
she
had
been
the
most
envied
the
most
admired
and
the
most
copied
woman
in
the
village
her
mother
an
insipid
spoiled
ambitious
little
woman
whose
fondest
hope
was
realized
when
her
dashing
daughter
made
a
financially
brilliant
match
had
lost
no
time
in
warning
the
bride
that
the
agonies
of
motherhood
and
the
long
ensuing
slavery
were
avoidable
and
clara
had
entirely
agreed
with
her
mother
ideas
and
used
to
laughingly
assure
the
few
old
friends
who
touched
upon
this
delicate
topic
that
she
herself
was
baby
enough
for
will
robbed
in
this
way
of
her
natural
estate
and
robbed
by
the
size
of
her
husband
income
from
the
exhilarating
interest
of
making
financial
ends
meet
white
for
seventeen
years
had
led
what
she
honestly
considered
an
enviable
and
carefree
existence
she
bought
beautiful
clothes
for
herself
and
beautiful
things
for
her
house
she
gave
her
husband
and
her
mother
very
handsome
gifts
she
was
a
perfect
hostess
although
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
never
extended
the
hospitalities
of
her
handsome
home
to
anyone
who
did
not
amuse
her
who
was
not
worth
while
she
ruled
her
servants
well
made
a
fine
president
for
the
local
women
club
ran
her
own
very
skillfully
and
played
an
exceptionally
good
game
of
bridge
she
was
an
authority
upon
fancy
needlework
fashions
in
dress
new
salads
new
methods
in
serving
the
table
willard
white
as
perfect
a
type
in
his
own
way
as
she
was
in
hers
was
very
proud
of
her
when
he
thought
of
her
at
all
which
was
really
much
less
often
than
their
acquaintances
supposed
he
liked
his
house
to
be
nicely
managed
spent
his
money
freely
upon
it
wanted
his
friends
handsomely
entertained
and
his
stocked
with
every
conceivable
variety
of
liquid
refreshment
if
clara
wanted
more
servants
let
her
have
them
if
she
wanted
corkscrews
by
the
gross
why
buy
those
too
only
let
a
man
feel
that
there
was
a
maid
around
to
bring
him
a
glass
when
he
came
in
from
golfing
or
motoring
and
a
corkscrew
with
the
glass
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
club
and
his
office
and
above
all
his
absorbed
him
his
natural
paternal
instinct
had
been
diverted
toward
these
latter
and
quite
without
his
knowing
it
his
cars
were
his
nursery
willard
white
had
owned
the
first
electric
car
ever
seen
in
santa
paloma
later
there
had
been
machines
and
he
loved
them
all
and
spoke
of
them
as
separate
entities
he
spoke
of
the
runs
they
had
made
of
the
strains
they
had
triumphantly
sustained
and
he
and
his
chauffeur
held
conferences
over
any
small
breakage
with
the
same
seriousness
that
he
might
have
used
had
willard
junior
supposing
there
to
have
been
such
a
little
person
developed
croup
and
made
the
presence
of
a
physician
necessary
he
liked
to
glance
across
his
lawn
at
night
to
the
commodious
garage
visible
in
the
moonlight
and
think
of
his
treasures
locked
up
guarded
perfect
in
every
detail
and
safe
he
and
white
always
spoke
of
santa
paloma
as
a
jay
town
and
compared
it
to
its
unutterable
disadvantage
to
other
and
larger
cities
but
still
business
reasons
would
always
keep
them
there
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
and
they
were
both
glad
to
hear
that
a
fabulously
wealthy
widow
and
a
woman
prominent
in
every
other
respect
as
well
had
come
to
live
in
santa
paloma
white
determined
to
play
her
game
very
carefully
with
burgoyne
there
should
be
no
indecent
hurry
there
should
be
no
sudden
overtures
at
friendship
but
poor
thing
she
will
certainly
find
our
house
an
oasis
in
the
desert
white
comfortably
decided
putting
on
the
very
handsomest
of
her
afternoon
gowns
to
go
and
call
formally
at
the
hall
burgoyne
and
the
little
girls
were
always
most
cordial
to
visitors
they
spent
these
first
days
deep
in
gardening
great
heaps
of
fragrant
dying
weeds
about
them
and
raw
vistas
through
the
pruned
trees
already
beginning
to
show
the
gracious
slopes
of
the
land
and
the
sleepy
lobos
down
beneath
the
willows
the
carew
children
and
the
little
browns
were
often
there
fascinated
by
the
outdoor
work
as
children
always
are
and
little
billy
valentine
squirmed
daily
through
his
own
particular
gap
in
the
hedge
and
took
his
share
of
the
fun
with
a
deep
and
silent
happiness
billy
gave
burgoyne
many
a
heartache
with
his
shock
of
bright
unbrushed
hair
his
neglected
grimed
little
hands
his
boyish
little
face
that
was
washed
daily
according
to
his
own
small
lights
with
surrounding
areas
of
neck
and
ears
wholly
overlooked
and
his
deep
eyes
sad
when
he
was
sad
and
somehow
infinitely
more
pathetic
when
he
was
happy
sometimes
she
stealthily
supplied
billy
with
new
garters
or
fastened
the
buttons
on
his
blue
overalls
or
even
gave
him
a
spoonful
of
meddy
out
of
a
big
bottle
at
the
mere
sight
of
which
ellen
shuddered
sympathetically
a
dose
which
was
always
followed
by
two
marshmallows
out
of
a
tin
box
by
way
of
consolation
but
further
than
this
she
dared
not
go
except
in
the
matter
of
mugs
of
milk
gingerbread
and
motherly
kisses
for
any
bump
or
bruise
the
village
women
coming
up
to
the
hall
in
the
pleasant
summer
afternoons
were
puzzled
to
find
the
old
place
almost
unchanged
why
any
woman
in
her
senses
wanted
to
live
among
those
horrors
the
women
of
santa
paloma
could
not
imagine
but
burgoyne
never
apologized
for
the
old
walnut
chairs
and
tables
and
the
old
velvet
carpets
and
the
hopelessly
white
lace
curtains
and
mirrors
even
captain
holly
big
clock
an
impossibly
hideous
thing
white
called
the
frantic
bronze
horses
and
the
clinging
tiger
on
their
onyx
hillside
was
serenely
ticking
and
the
pink
china
vases
were
filled
with
flowers
and
there
was
an
air
of
such
homely
comfort
after
all
about
the
big
rooms
such
a
fragrance
of
flowers
and
flood
of
sunny
fresh
air
that
the
whole
effect
was
not
half
as
bad
as
it
might
be
imagined
indeed
when
mammy
curry
the
magnificent
old
negress
who
was
supreme
in
the
kitchen
and
respected
in
the
nursery
as
well
came
in
with
her
stiff
white
apron
and
silver
she
seemed
to
fit
into
the
picture
and
add
a
completing
touch
to
the
whole
very
simply
very
unpretentiously
the
new
mistress
of
holly
hall
entered
upon
her
new
life
she
was
a
woman
of
very
quiet
tastes
devoted
to
her
little
girls
her
music
her
garden
and
her
books
with
the
negress
she
had
one
other
servant
a
quiet
little
new
england
girl
with
terrified
childish
eyes
and
a
passionate
devotion
to
her
mistress
and
all
that
concerned
her
mistress
fanny
had
in
charge
a
splendid
little
boy
of
three
who
played
happily
by
himself
about
the
kitchen
door
and
chased
chickens
and
kittens
with
shrieks
of
delight
burgoyne
spoke
of
him
as
fanny
little
brother
and
if
the
two
had
a
history
of
any
sort
it
was
one
at
which
she
never
hinted
she
met
an
embarrassing
question
with
a
readiness
which
rather
amused
brown
on
a
day
when
the
two
younger
ladies
were
having
tea
with
apostleman
and
the
conversation
turned
to
the
subject
of
but
if
your
little
girl
fanny
has
had
her
lesson
you
have
no
trouble
keepin
her
said
apostleman
oh
i
hope
i
shall
keep
fanny
said
burgoyne
she
comes
of
such
nice
people
and
she
such
a
sweet
good
girl
why
lord
save
us
said
the
old
lady
repentantly
and
i
was
almost
ready
to
believe
the
child
was
hers
if
peter
was
hers
she
could
be
fonder
of
him
burgoyne
said
mildly
and
brown
choked
on
her
tea
and
had
to
wipe
her
eyes
in
the
matter
of
fanny
and
in
a
dozen
other
small
matters
the
independence
of
the
great
lady
was
not
slow
in
showing
itself
in
burgoyne
santa
paloma
might
be
annoyed
at
her
and
puzzled
by
her
but
it
had
perforce
to
accept
her
as
she
stood
or
ignore
her
and
she
was
obviously
not
a
person
to
ignore
she
declined
all
invitations
for
daytime
festivities
she
was
always
busy
in
the
daytime
she
said
no
cards
no
luncheons
no
could
lure
her
away
from
the
hall
although
if
she
and
the
small
girls
walked
in
for
mail
or
were
down
in
the
village
for
any
other
reason
they
were
very
apt
to
stop
somewhere
for
a
chat
on
their
way
home
but
the
children
were
allowed
to
go
nowhere
alone
and
not
the
smartest
of
children
parties
could
boast
of
the
presence
of
joanna
and
ellen
burgoyne
santa
paloma
children
were
much
given
to
parties
or
rather
their
parents
were
and
every
separate
party
was
a
separate
great
event
the
little
girls
wore
exquisite
garments
silken
hose
and
white
shoes
professional
entertainers
in
fashionably
darkened
rooms
kept
the
little
people
amused
and
professional
caterers
supplied
the
supper
they
ate
or
perhaps
the
affair
took
the
shape
of
a
for
a
matinee
and
a
supper
at
the
town
one
really
pretty
followed
these
affairs
were
duly
chronicled
in
the
daily
and
weekly
papers
and
perhaps
more
than
one
matron
would
have
liked
the
distinction
of
having
burgoyne
little
daughters
listed
among
her
own
child
guests
joanna
and
ellen
were
pretty
children
in
a
sort
of
way
and
would
have
been
popular
even
without
the
added
distinction
of
their
ready
french
and
german
and
italian
their
charming
manners
their
naive
references
to
other
countries
and
peoples
and
their
beautiful
and
distinguished
mother
but
in
answer
to
all
invitations
there
came
only
polite
stilted
little
letters
of
regret
in
the
children
round
script
mother
would
we
should
go
to
a
party
until
we
are
young
ladies
ellen
would
say
cheerfully
if
on
the
subject
leaving
it
to
the
more
tactful
joanna
to
add
but
mother
thanks
you
just
as
much
they
were
always
close
to
their
mother
when
it
was
possible
and
she
only
banished
them
from
her
side
when
the
conversation
grew
undeniably
too
old
in
tone
for
joanna
and
ellen
and
then
liked
to
keep
them
in
sight
have
them
come
in
with
the
or
wave
to
her
occasionally
from
the
river
bank
we
been
wondering
what
you
would
do
with
this
magnificent
said
white
on
her
first
visit
the
house
ought
to
take
a
colonial
treatment
wonderfully
there
a
remarkable
man
in
san
francisco
who
simply
made
our
house
over
for
us
last
year
it
must
have
been
a
fearful
upheaval
said
burgoyne
sympathetically
oh
we
went
away
white
and
i
went
east
and
when
we
came
back
it
was
all
done
well
fortunately
said
the
mistress
of
holly
hall
cheerfully
as
she
sugared
apostleman
cup
of
tea
fortunately
all
these
things
of
holly
were
in
splendid
condition
except
for
a
little
cleaning
and
polishing
they
used
to
make
things
so
much
more
solid
do
you
think
so
why
there
are
years
of
wear
left
in
these
carpets
and
the
chairs
and
tables
are
like
rocks
captain
holly
apparently
got
the
very
best
of
everything
when
he
furnished
this
place
and
i
reap
the
benefit
it
so
nice
to
feel
that
one
need
buy
a
chair
or
a
bed
for
ten
years
or
more
if
one
does
want
to
dear
sweet
people
the
hollys
said
white
pleasantly
utterly
at
a
loss
did
people
of
the
nicer
class
speak
of
furniture
as
if
it
were
made
merely
to
be
useful
but
what
a
distinct
period
these
things
belong
to
do
they
she
asked
feeling
her
way
so
so
solid
yes
in
a
way
it
was
an
ugly
period
said
burgoyne
placidly
but
very
comfortable
fortunately
fancy
if
he
had
selected
louis
quinze
chairs
for
example
white
gave
her
a
puzzled
look
and
smiled
come
now
burgoyne
said
she
confess
that
you
are
going
to
give
us
all
a
surprise
some
day
and
change
all
this
one
sees
said
white
elegantly
such
lovely
effects
in
new
york
in
those
upper
fifth
avenue
shops
ah
but
do
you
see
lovely
things
the
other
woman
assented
warmly
of
course
one
could
be
always
changing
she
went
on
but
i
like
associations
with
things
and
changing
takes
so
much
time
some
day
we
may
think
all
this
quite
pretty
she
finished
with
a
contented
glance
at
the
comfortable
ugliness
of
the
oh
do
you
suppose
we
shall
really
white
gave
a
little
incredulous
laugh
she
was
going
pretty
far
and
she
knew
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
entirely
unable
to
believe
that
there
was
a
woman
in
the
world
who
could
afford
to
have
what
was
fashionable
and
expensive
in
household
furnishings
or
apparel
and
who
deliberately
preferred
not
to
have
it
that
her
own
pretty
things
were
no
sooner
established
than
they
began
to
lose
their
charm
for
her
never
occurred
to
white
she
was
a
woman
of
conventional
type
perfectly
satisfied
to
spend
her
whole
life
in
acquiring
things
essentially
invaluable
and
to
use
a
naturally
shrewd
and
quick
intelligence
in
copying
fashions
of
all
sorts
small
and
large
as
fast
as
advanced
merchants
and
magazines
presented
them
to
her
she
was
one
of
the
great
army
of
women
who
help
to
send
the
sale
of
an
immoral
book
well
up
into
the
hundreds
of
thousands
she
liked
to
spend
long
afternoons
with
a
box
of
chocolates
and
a
book
unfit
for
the
touch
of
any
woman
a
book
that
she
would
review
for
the
benefit
of
her
friends
later
with
a
shocked
wonder
that
they
dare
print
such
things
she
liked
to
tell
a
man
story
and
the
other
women
could
not
but
laugh
at
her
for
she
was
undeniably
good
company
and
nobody
ever
questioned
the
taste
of
anything
she
ever
said
or
did
she
was
a
famous
gossip
for
like
all
women
she
found
the
private
affairs
of
other
people
full
of
fascination
and
having
no
legitimate
occupation
she
was
always
at
liberty
to
discuss
them
yet
white
was
not
at
all
an
unusual
woman
and
like
her
associates
she
tacitly
assumed
herself
to
be
the
very
flower
of
american
womanhood
she
quoted
her
distinguished
relatives
on
all
occasions
the
white
family
in
all
its
ramifications
supplied
the
correct
precedent
for
all
the
world
there
was
no
social
emergency
to
which
some
cousin
or
aunt
of
white
had
not
been
more
than
equal
having
no
children
of
her
own
she
still
could
silence
and
shame
many
a
good
mother
with
references
to
cousin
ethel
langstroth
kiddies
or
to
aunt
grace
thurston
wonderful
governess
personally
white
vaguely
felt
that
there
was
something
innately
indecent
about
children
anyway
the
smaller
they
were
the
less
mentionable
she
found
them
the
little
emergencies
of
and
torn
garments
and
spilled
porridge
that
were
constantly
arising
in
the
neighborhood
of
children
made
her
genuinely
sick
and
faint
and
she
had
so
humorous
and
so
assured
an
air
of
saying
disgusting
or
disgraceful
when
the
family
of
some
other
woman
began
to
present
itself
with
reasonable
promptness
that
other
women
found
themselves
laughing
and
saying
disgusting
too
burgoyne
like
white
was
a
born
leader
whether
she
made
any
particular
effort
to
influence
her
neighbors
or
not
they
could
not
but
feel
the
difference
in
her
attitude
toward
all
the
various
tangible
things
that
make
a
woman
life
she
was
essentially
maternal
wanted
to
mother
all
the
little
living
and
growing
things
in
the
world
wanted
to
be
with
children
and
talk
of
them
and
study
them
and
she
was
simple
and
honest
in
her
tastes
and
entirely
without
affectation
in
her
manner
and
she
was
too
great
a
lady
to
be
either
laughed
at
or
ignored
so
santa
paloma
began
to
ask
itself
why
she
did
this
or
that
and
finding
her
ways
all
made
for
economy
and
comfort
and
simplicity
almost
unconsciously
copied
them
chapter
vi
when
apostleman
invited
several
of
her
friends
to
a
formal
dinner
given
especially
for
burgoyne
everyone
realized
that
the
newcomer
was
accepted
and
the
event
was
one
of
several
in
which
the
women
of
santa
paloma
tried
with
more
than
ordinary
eagerness
to
outshine
each
other
apostleman
herself
never
entered
into
competition
with
the
younger
matrons
nor
did
they
expect
it
of
her
she
gave
heavy
rich
dinners
in
her
own
way
in
which
her
servants
were
perfectly
trained
it
was
a
standing
joke
among
her
friends
that
they
always
ate
too
much
at
apostleman
house
there
were
always
seven
or
eight
substantial
courses
and
she
liked
to
have
the
plates
come
back
for
more
lobster
salad
or
roast
turkey
in
this
as
in
all
things
she
was
a
law
unto
herself
but
for
the
other
women
white
set
the
pace
and
difficult
to
keep
they
often
found
it
but
they
never
questioned
it
they
admired
the
richer
woman
perfect
and
struggled
blindly
to
accumulate
the
same
number
and
variety
of
napkins
and
fingerbowls
ramekins
and
glasses
and
candlesticks
and
special
forks
and
special
knives
the
first
of
the
month
with
its
bills
became
a
horror
to
them
and
they
were
continually
promising
their
husbands
in
all
good
faith
that
expenses
should
positively
be
cut
down
but
what
use
were
good
resolves
when
one
might
find
the
very
next
day
that
there
were
no
more
cherries
for
the
grapefruit
that
one
had
not
a
pair
of
presentable
white
gloves
for
the
club
or
that
the
that
the
children
were
planning
was
to
cost
them
five
dollars
apiece
to
serve
grapefruit
without
cherries
to
wear
colored
gloves
or
no
gloves
at
all
to
the
club
and
to
substitute
some
inexpensive
pleasure
for
the
ride
was
a
course
that
never
occurred
to
carew
that
never
occurred
to
any
of
her
friends
carew
might
have
a
very
vague
idea
of
her
daughter
spiritual
needs
she
might
be
an
entire
stranger
to
the
delicately
adjusted
and
exquisitely
susceptible
entity
that
was
the
real
jeanette
but
she
would
have
gone
hungry
rather
than
have
jeanette
unable
to
wear
white
shoes
to
sunday
school
rather
than
tie
jeanette
braids
with
ribbons
that
were
not
stiff
and
new
she
was
so
entirely
absorbed
in
pursuit
of
the
correct
thing
so
anxious
to
read
what
was
being
read
to
own
what
was
right
that
she
never
stopped
to
seriously
consider
her
own
or
her
daughter
place
in
the
universe
she
was
glad
of
course
when
the
children
liked
their
teacher
just
as
she
had
been
glad
years
before
when
they
liked
their
nurse
the
reasons
for
such
likings
or
dislikings
she
never
investigated
she
had
taken
care
of
the
children
herself
during
the
nurse
regular
days
off
but
she
always
regarded
these
occasions
as
so
much
lost
time
carew
kept
her
children
as
she
kept
her
house
and
she
gave
about
as
much
thought
to
the
spiritual
needs
of
the
one
as
the
other
she
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
the
best
things
in
life
are
to
be
had
for
money
and
that
earthly
happiness
or
unhappiness
falls
in
exact
ratio
with
the
possession
or
of
money
she
met
the
growing
demands
of
her
family
as
well
as
she
could
and
practised
all
sorts
of
harassing
private
economies
so
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
family
might
seem
to
be
spending
a
great
deal
more
money
than
was
actually
the
case
carew
was
not
an
analytical
mind
but
sometimes
she
found
herself
genuinely
puzzled
by
the
financial
state
of
affairs
i
do
know
where
the
money
goes
to
she
said
in
a
confidential
moment
to
lloyd
they
had
met
in
the
market
where
carew
was
consulting
a
long
list
of
necessary
groceries
oh
do
speak
of
it
said
lloyd
feelingly
that
so
your
dinner
is
tomorrow
night
is
it
she
added
with
interest
are
you
going
to
have
lizzie
oh
dear
me
yes
for
eight
you
know
sha
you
have
her
for
lloyd
turn
to
entertain
burgoyne
followed
carew
by
only
a
few
days
lizzie
and
her
mother
too
said
the
other
woman
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
maids
in
these
days
she
went
on
they
simply
ca
do
things
as
my
mother
maids
used
to
for
example
now
the
four
of
them
will
be
working
all
day
over
thursday
dinner
and
dear
me
it
a
simple
enough
dinner
well
you
have
to
serve
so
much
with
a
dinner
nowadays
carew
said
in
a
mildly
martyred
tone
crackers
and
everything
else
with
oysters
i
going
to
have
cucumber
sandwiches
with
the
soup
delicious
said
lloyd
olives
salted
nuts
currant
jelly
carew
was
reading
her
list
chutney
saltines
cream
cheese
those
are
for
the
salad
you
know
rolls
sandwich
bread
fancy
cakes
maraschino
cherries
maple
sugar
that
to
go
hot
on
the
ice
i
going
to
serve
it
in
melons
and
just
pink
and
green
wafers
i
think
all
that
before
it
comes
to
the
actual
dinner
at
all
and
it
all
so
fussy
do
say
one
word
said
lloyd
sympathetically
but
it
sounds
she
added
consolingly
and
little
carew
went
contentedly
home
to
a
hot
and
furious
session
in
her
kitchen
hours
of
baking
boiling
and
frying
chopping
and
whipping
and
frosting
creaming
and
seasoning
freezing
and
straining
i
do
mind
the
work
if
only
everything
goes
right
carew
would
say
gallantly
to
herself
and
it
must
be
said
to
her
credit
that
usually
everything
did
go
right
at
her
house
although
even
the
maids
in
the
kitchen
heroically
attacking
pyramids
of
sticky
plates
were
not
so
tired
as
she
was
when
the
dinner
was
well
over
but
there
was
a
certain
stimulus
in
the
mere
thought
of
entertaining
burgoyne
and
there
was
the
exhilarating
consciousness
that
one
of
these
days
she
would
entertain
in
turn
so
the
santa
paloma
housewives
exerted
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
their
endurance
and
one
delightful
dinner
party
followed
another
but
a
dispassionate
onlooker
from
another
planet
might
have
found
it
curious
to
notice
in
contrast
to
this
uniformity
that
no
two
women
dressed
alike
on
these
occasions
and
no
woman
who
could
help
it
wore
the
same
gown
twice
brown
and
carew
to
be
sure
wore
their
little
old
silks
more
than
once
but
each
was
secretly
consoled
by
the
thought
that
a
really
smart
new
gown
awaited
white
dinner
which
was
naturally
the
climax
of
all
the
affairs
only
the
wearers
and
their
knew
what
hours
had
been
spent
upon
these
costumes
what
discouraged
debates
attended
their
making
what
muscular
agonies
their
fitting
only
they
could
have
estimated
and
they
never
did
estimate
the
time
lost
over
pattern
books
the
nervous
strain
of
placing
this
bit
of
spangled
net
or
that
square
inch
of
lace
the
hurried
trips
downtown
for
samples
and
linings
for
fringes
and
embroideries
and
braids
and
ribbons
the
gown
that
she
wore
to
her
own
dinner
white
had
had
fitted
in
the
maison
dernier
mot
in
paris
it
was
an
enchanting
frock
of
embroidered
white
illusion
over
pink
illusion
over
black
illusion
under
a
short
heavy
tunic
of
silver
spangles
and
threads
the
yoke
was
of
wonderful
old
lace
and
there
was
a
girdle
of
heavy
pink
cords
and
silver
clasps
to
match
the
aigrette
that
was
held
by
pink
and
silver
cords
in
white
beautifully
arranged
hair
burgoyne
gowns
or
rather
gown
for
she
wore
exactly
the
same
costume
to
every
dinner
could
hardly
have
been
more
startling
than
santa
paloma
found
it
had
it
gone
to
any
unbecoming
extreme
yet
it
was
the
simplest
of
black
summer
silks
soft
and
full
in
the
skirt
and
with
a
touch
of
lace
at
the
neck
she
arranged
her
hair
in
a
becoming
loose
knot
and
somehow
managed
to
look
noticeably
lovely
and
distinguished
in
the
gay
assemblies
to
brighten
the
black
gown
she
wore
a
rope
of
pearls
looped
twice
about
her
white
throat
and
hanging
far
below
her
waist
pearls
as
adams
remarked
in
discouragement
later
that
just
made
you
feel
what
the
use
she
could
wear
a
kitchen
apron
with
those
pearls
if
she
wanted
to
everyone
would
know
she
could
afford
cloth
of
gold
and
ermine
with
this
erratic
and
inexplicable
simplicity
of
dress
she
combined
the
finish
of
manner
the
poise
the
ready
sympathies
of
a
truly
cultivated
and
intelligent
woman
she
could
talk
not
only
of
her
own
personal
experiences
but
of
the
political
and
literary
and
scientific
movements
of
the
day
certain
proposed
state
legislation
happened
to
be
interesting
the
men
of
santa
paloma
at
this
time
and
she
seemed
to
understand
it
and
spoke
readily
of
it
but
george
said
carew
walking
home
in
the
summer
night
after
the
adams
dinner
you
have
often
said
you
hated
women
to
talk
about
things
they
did
understand
but
she
does
understand
dearie
that
just
the
point
yes
but
you
differed
with
her
george
well
but
that
different
jen
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
i
suppose
she
has
friends
in
washington
who
keep
her
informed
said
carew
a
little
discontentedly
after
a
silence
and
there
was
another
pause
before
she
said
where
do
men
get
their
information
george
papers
dear
and
talking
i
suppose
they
interested
you
know
yes
but
little
carew
burst
out
resentfully
i
never
can
make
head
or
tail
of
the
papers
they
say
resigns
or
blow
to
interests
or
scores
triumph
and
do
know
what
it
about
george
carew
big
laugh
rang
out
in
the
night
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
said
you
great
jen
shortly
after
white
dinner
a
certain
distinguished
old
artist
from
new
york
and
his
son
came
to
stay
a
night
or
two
at
holly
hall
on
their
way
home
from
the
orient
and
burgoyne
took
this
occasion
to
invite
a
score
of
her
new
friends
to
two
small
dinners
planned
for
the
two
nights
of
the
great
karl
von
praag
stay
in
santa
paloma
i
do
see
how
she
going
to
handle
two
dinners
for
ten
people
each
with
just
that
colored
cook
of
hers
and
one
waitress
said
willard
white
late
one
evening
when
white
was
finishing
a
book
and
a
cigar
in
their
handsome
bedroom
and
she
was
at
her
caterers
submitted
white
turning
a
page
i
suppose
so
his
wife
agreed
after
a
thoughtful
silence
she
added
sue
adams
says
that
she
supposes
that
when
a
woman
has
as
much
money
as
that
she
loses
all
interest
in
spending
it
personally
i
do
see
how
she
can
entertain
a
great
big
man
like
von
praag
in
that
house
she
never
seems
to
think
of
it
at
all
she
never
apologizes
for
it
and
she
talks
as
if
nobody
ever
bought
new
things
until
the
old
were
worn
out
her
eyes
went
about
her
own
big
bedroom
as
she
spoke
nothing
here
even
eighteen
years
ago
when
the
whites
were
married
their
home
had
been
furnished
in
a
manner
to
make
the
holly
hall
of
look
out
of
date
white
shuddered
now
at
the
mere
memory
of
what
she
as
a
bride
had
thought
so
beautiful
the
pale
green
carpet
the
green
satin
curtains
the
chairs
and
tables
and
bed
the
easels
the
gilded
frames
seven
or
eight
years
later
she
had
changed
all
this
for
a
heavy
brass
bedstead
and
dark
rugs
on
a
polished
floor
and
maple
chests
and
chairs
and
all
feminine
santa
paloma
talked
of
the
whites
new
things
six
or
seven
years
after
that
again
two
mahogany
beds
replaced
the
brass
one
and
heavy
mahogany
bureaus
with
glass
knobs
had
their
day
with
plain
net
curtains
and
woven
rugs
but
all
these
were
in
the
now
and
in
her
own
bedroom
white
had
a
complete
set
of
circassian
walnut
heavily
carved
and
ornamented
with
cunningly
inset
panels
of
rattan
on
the
beds
were
covers
of
oriental
cottons
and
the
showed
the
same
elementary
designs
in
pinks
and
blues
she
dresses
very
prettily
i
thought
observed
white
apropos
of
his
wife
last
remark
dresses
echoed
his
wife
she
dresses
as
your
mother
might
very
pretty
very
pretty
said
the
man
absently
over
his
book
there
was
a
silence
then
that
just
shows
how
much
men
notice
white
confided
to
her
brush
i
believe
they
like
women
to
look
like
frumps

his
wild
mop
had
been
cut
far
too
close
and
a
large
new
hat
and
new
shoes
were
much
in
evidence
think
he
looks
all
right
said
barry
with
an
anxious
wistfulness
that
went
straight
to
her
heart
he
looks
better
he
i
been
fixing
him
up
and
free
sailor
waists
and
stockings
and
nighties
supplemented
billy
also
anxious
for
her
approval
he
looks
lovely
said
sidney
enthusiastically
even
while
she
was
mentally
raising
the
collar
of
his
waist
and
taking
an
inch
or
two
off
the
trousers
she
lifted
the
child
up
to
sit
on
his
father
desk
and
kissed
the
top
of
his
little
cropped
head
we
may
not
express
ourselves
very
fluently
said
barry
who
was
seated
in
his
own
revolving
chair
and
busily
opening
and
shutting
the
drawers
of
his
desk
but
we
appreciate
the
interest
beautiful
ladies
take
in
our
manners
and
morals
and
the
new
they
buy
us
my
dear
protested
burgoyne
between
laughter
and
tears
ellen
used
his
old
one
up
cleaning
out
their
and
she
put
her
warm
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
do
be
a
goose
barry
as
unselfconsciously
as
a
sister
might
where
are
you
two
boys
going
billy
she
asked
going
back
to
her
own
desk
billy
said
he
going
over
to
the
kindergarten
i
got
some
work
i
ought
to
finish
here
barry
supplemented
i
take
you
across
the
street
infant
i
be
right
back
sidney
but
barry
why
are
you
working
now
asked
the
lady
a
few
minutes
later
when
he
took
his
place
at
his
desk
oh
do
you
worry
he
answered
smiling
i
love
it
the
thought
of
old
rogers
face
when
he
opens
his
paper
every
morning
does
me
good
i
writing
this
appeal
for
the
new
reservoir
now
and
i
got
to
play
up
the
flower
festival
i
not
interested
in
the
flower
festival
said
burgoyne
and
the
minute
it
over
i
going
to
start
a
crusade
for
a
girls
clubhouse
in
old
paloma
conditions
over
there
for
the
girls
are
something
hideous
but
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
on
with
the
festival
for
the
present
it
a
great
occasion
i
suppose
oh
tremendous
the
governor
coming
and
thousands
of
visitors
always
pour
into
town
we
have
nearly
a
hundred
carriages
in
the
parade
simply
covered
with
flowers
you
know
it
lovely
you
wait
until
things
get
fairly
started
that
be
fourth
of
july
sidney
said
thoughtfully
turning
back
to
her
exchanges
i
begin
my
clubhouse
crusade
on
the
fifth
she
added
firmly
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
in
the
office
except
for
the
rustling
of
paper
and
the
scratch
of
pens
from
the
sunny
world
came
a
pleasant
blending
of
many
noises
passing
wagons
the
low
talk
of
chickens
the
slamming
of
gates
and
now
and
then
the
not
unmusical
note
of
a
footsteps
and
laughing
voices
went
by
and
died
into
silence
the
clock
from
town
hall
square
struck
eleven
slowly
this
is
darned
pleasant
said
barry
presently
over
his
work
is
it
said
the
editor
of
the
women
page
and
again
there
was
silence
after
a
while
barry
said
finished
with
a
great
breath
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
wheeled
about
to
find
the
lady
quietly
watching
him
barry
are
you
working
too
hard
said
she
quite
unembarrassed
am
i
lord
not
i
wish
the
days
were
twice
as
long
i
barry
rumpled
his
thick
hair
with
a
gesture
that
was
familiar
to
sidney
now
i
guess
work
agrees
with
me
by
george
i
hate
to
eat
and
i
hate
to
sleep
i
want
to
be
down
here
all
the
time
or
else
rustling
up
subscriptions
and
and
i
thought
you
were
lazy
said
sidney
finding
herself
for
the
first
time
in
their
friendship
curiously
inclined
to
keep
the
conversation
personal
this
warm
june
morning
it
was
a
thing
extremely
difficult
to
do
with
barry
you
certainly
gave
me
that
impression
she
said
yes
but
that
was
two
months
ago
said
barry
off
guard
a
second
later
he
changed
the
topic
abruptly
by
asking
did
your
roses
come
all
of
them
answered
sidney
pleasantly
and
vaguely
conscious
of
mischief
in
the
air
but
led
on
by
some
inexplicable
whim
she
pursued
do
you
mean
that
it
makes
such
a
difference
to
you
rogers
being
gone
barry
trimmed
the
four
sides
of
a
clipping
with
four
clips
of
his
shears
exactly
said
he
briefly
he
banged
a
drawer
shut
closed
a
book
and
laid
it
aside
and
stuck
the
brush
into
his
getting
enough
of
dinner
parties
he
asked
then
cheerfully
too
much
said
sidney
wondering
why
she
felt
like
a
reprimanded
child
and
that
reminds
me
i
am
giving
two
dinners
for
the
von
praags
you
know
i
ca
manage
everybody
at
once
i
hate
more
than
ten
people
at
a
dinner
and
you
are
asked
to
the
first
i
do
go
much
to
dinners
barry
said
i
know
you
do
but
i
want
you
to
come
to
this
one
said
sidney
you
love
old
von
praag
and
richard
the
son
is
a
dear
i
really
want
you
he
an
artist
too
is
he
said
barry
without
enthusiasm
who
richard
she
asked
something
in
his
manner
putting
her
a
little
at
a
loss
yes
and
he
very
clever
and
so
nice
he
like
a
brother
to
me
barry
did
not
answer
but
after
a
moment
he
said
scowling
a
little
and
not
looking
up
a
fellow
like
that
has
pretty
smooth
sailing
rich
the
son
of
a
big
man
traveling
all
he
wants
to
studio
in
new
york
clubs
oh
richard
has
his
troubles
sidney
said
his
wife
is
very
delicate
and
they
lost
their
little
girl
are
you
angry
with
me
about
anything
barry
she
broke
off
puzzled
and
distressed
for
this
unresponsive
almost
sullen
manner
was
unlike
anything
she
had
ever
seen
in
him
but
a
moment
later
he
turned
toward
her
with
his
familiar
sunny
smile
why
did
you
say
so
before
he
said
sheepishly
say
she
echoed
bewilderedly
then
with
a
sudden
rush
of
enlightenment
why
barry
you
not
jealous
a
second
later
she
would
have
given
much
to
have
the
words
unsaid
they
faced
each
other
in
silence
the
color
mounting
steadily
in
face
i
did
mean
of
me
she
stammered
uncomfortably
i
meant
of
everything
i
thought
but
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
say
it
sounded
i
did
think
i
do
know
why
you
should
have
thought
it
since
i
was
fool
enough
to
show
it
said
barry
after
a
moment
coming
over
to
her
desk
and
facing
her
squarely
sidney
stood
up
opposite
him
her
heart
beating
wildly
and
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
jealous
he
went
on
steadily
at
the
idea
that
some
old
friend
might
come
in
here
and
take
you
away
from
santa
paloma
you
asked
me
if
it
was
old
going
that
made
a
difference
to
me
i
know
interrupted
sidney
please
but
you
know
better
than
that
barry
went
on
his
voice
rising
a
little
you
know
what
you
have
done
for
me
if
ever
i
try
to
speak
of
it
you
say
as
you
said
about
the
kid
just
now
dear
boy
i
like
to
do
it
but
i
going
to
say
what
i
mean
now
once
and
for
all
you
loaned
me
money
and
it
was
through
your
lending
it
that
i
got
credit
to
borrow
more
you
gave
me
a
chance
to
be
my
own
master
you
showed
you
had
faith
in
me
you
reminded
me
of
the
ambition
i
had
as
a
kid
before
hetty
and
all
that
trouble
had
crushed
it
out
of
me
you
came
down
here
to
the
office
and
talked
and
planned
and
took
it
for
granted
that
i
was
going
to
pull
myself
together
and
stop
idling
and
kicking
and
fooling
away
my
time
and
all
through
these
six
weeks
of
rough
sailing
you
let
me
go
up
there
to
the
hall
and
tell
you
everything
and
then
you
wonder
if
i
could
ever
be
jealous
his
tone
which
had
risen
almost
to
violence
fell
suddenly
he
went
back
to
his
desk
and
began
to
straighten
the
papers
there
not
seeing
what
he
did
i
never
can
say
anything
more
to
you
sidney
i
said
too
much
now
he
said
a
little
huskily
but
i
glad
to
have
you
know
how
i
feel
sidney
stood
quite
still
her
breath
coming
and
going
quickly
she
was
fundamentally
too
honest
a
woman
to
meet
the
situation
with
one
of
the
hundred
insincerities
that
suggested
themselves
to
her
she
knew
she
was
to
blame
and
she
longed
to
undo
the
mischief
and
put
their
friendship
back
where
it
had
been
only
an
hour
ago
but
the
right
words
did
not
suggest
themselves
and
she
could
only
stand
silently
watching
him
barry
had
opened
a
book
and
holding
it
in
both
hands
was
apparently
absorbed
in
its
contents
neither
had
spoken
or
moved
and
sidney
was
meditating
a
sudden
wordless
departure
when
ellen
burgoyne
burst
noisily
into
the
room
ellen
was
a
square
splendid
child
always
conversationally
inclined
and
never
at
a
loss
for
a
subject
you
look
as
if
you
wanted
to
cry
mother
said
she
perhaps
you
did
hear
the
whistle
school
out
we
been
waiting
ever
so
long
mother
i
know
you
said
you
hoped
heaven
would
not
send
any
more
dogs
our
way
for
a
long
while
but
jo
and
jeanette
and
i
found
one
by
the
school
fence
mother
you
will
say
it
has
the
most
pathetic
face
you
ever
saw
when
you
see
it
its
ear
was
bloody
and
it
licked
jo
hand
so
gently
and
it
such
a
dog
jo
has
it
wrapped
up
in
her
coat
mother
may
we
have
it
please
please
barry
wheeled
about
with
his
hearty
laugh
and
burgoyne
laughing
too
stopped
the
eager
little
mouth
with
a
kiss
it
sounds
as
if
we
must
certainly
have
him
baby
said
she
chapter
viii
the
new
mistress
of
the
hall
in
her
vigorous
young
interest
in
all
things
included
naturally
a
keen
enjoyment
of
the
village
love
affairs
she
liked
to
hear
the
histories
of
the
old
families
all
about
she
wanted
to
know
the
occupants
of
every
shabby
old
surrey
that
drew
up
at
the
while
the
mail
was
being
sorted
but
if
the
conversation
turned
to
mere
idle
talk
and
speculation
she
was
conspicuously
silent
and
upon
an
occasion
when
adams
casually
referred
to
a
favorite
little
piece
of
scandal
burgoyne
gave
the
conversation
a
sudden
twist
that
as
white
who
was
present
said
later
made
you
afraid
to
call
your
soul
your
own
do
you
tell
me
that
that
pretty
little
thorne
girl
is
actually
meeting
this
young
man
whoever
he
is
while
her
mother
thinks
she
is
taking
a
music
lesson
demanded
burgoyne
suddenly
entering
into
the
conversation
there
nothing
against
him
i
suppose
she
could
see
him
at
home
oh
no
he
a
nice
enough
little
fellow
white
said
but
a
silly
little
thing
and
i
imagine
her
people
are
very
severe
with
her
she
never
goes
to
dances
or
seems
to
have
any
fun
i
wonder
if
we
could
go
see
the
mother
and
hint
that
there
is
beginning
to
be
a
little
talk
about
katherine
mused
burgoyne
do
you
think
so
mrs
adams
oh
my
goodness
adams
said
nervously
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
would
for
the
world
i
never
dreamed
one
would
hate
to
start
trouble
adams
is
very
fond
of
the
thornes
but
we
ought
to
save
her
if
we
can
we
married
women
who
know
how
mischievous
that
sort
of
thing
is
burgoyne
urged
why
probably
they
not
met
but
once
or
twice
white
said
annoyed
but
with
a
comfortable
air
of
closing
the
subject
and
no
more
was
said
at
the
time
but
both
she
and
adams
were
a
little
uneasy
two
or
three
days
later
when
returning
from
a
motor
trip
they
saw
burgoyne
standing
at
the
thornes
gate
in
laughing
conversation
with
pretty
little
katherine
and
her
angular
tall
mother
and
there
is
nothing
in
that
story
at
all
said
burgoyne
later
to
carew
i
suppose
you
walked
up
and
said
you
are
miss
thorne
you
are
clandestinely
meeting
joe
turner
down
by
the
old
mill
every
week
laughed
carew
i
managed
it
very
nicely
burgoyne
said
i
admired
their
yellow
rose
one
day
as
i
passed
the
gate
thorne
was
standing
there
and
i
asked
if
it
was
a
banksia
then
the
little
girl
came
out
of
the
house
and
she
happened
to
know
who
i
am
astonishingly
bright
child
said
carew
well
and
then
we
talked
roses
and
the
father
came
home
a
nice
old
man
and
i
asked
him
if
he
lend
me
miss
thorne
now
and
then
to
play
duets
and
he
agreed
so
the
child
been
up
to
the
hall
once
or
twice
and
she
a
nice
little
thing
she
does
care
tuppence
for
the
turner
boy
but
he
musical
and
she
quite
and
now
and
then
they
meet
her
father
wo
let
anyone
see
her
at
the
house
she
wants
to
study
abroad
but
they
ca
afford
it
i
imagine
so
written
to
see
if
i
can
interest
a
friend
of
mine
in
berlin
but
why
do
you
smile
she
broke
off
to
ask
innocently
at
the
thought
of
your
friend
in
berlin
said
carew
audaciously
for
she
was
not
at
all
awed
by
burgoyne
now
indeed
she
and
brown
were
growing
genuinely
fond
of
their
new
neighbor
and
the
occupants
of
the
hall
supplied
them
with
constant
amusement
and
interest
great
lady
and
great
heiress
sidney
burgoyne
might
be
but
she
lived
a
life
far
simpler
than
their
own
and
loved
to
have
them
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
talk
even
if
she
were
cutting
out
cookies
with
joanna
and
ellen
leaning
on
the
table
or
feeding
the
chickens
whose
individual
careers
interested
her
so
deeply
she
walked
with
the
little
girls
to
school
every
morning
and
met
them
near
the
school
at
one
in
the
meantime
she
made
a
visit
to
the
mail
office
and
perhaps
spent
an
hour
or
two
there
or
in
the
markets
but
at
least
three
times
a
week
she
wandered
over
to
old
paloma
and
spent
the
forenoon
in
the
dingy
streets
across
the
river
what
she
did
there
perhaps
no
one
but
doctor
brown
who
came
to
have
a
real
affection
and
respect
for
her
fully
appreciated
burgoyne
would
tell
him
when
they
met
in
some
hour
of
life
or
death
that
she
was
making
friends
it
was
quite
true
she
was
the
type
of
woman
who
can
not
pass
a
small
child
in
the
street
she
must
stop
and
ask
questions
decide
disputes
and
give
advice
and
through
the
children
she
won
the
big
brothers
and
sisters
and
fathers
and
mothers
of
old
paloma
even
a
prejudice
against
the
women
of
her
class
and
their
method
of
dealing
with
the
less
fortunate
could
not
prevail
against
her
disarming
friendly
manner
her
simple
gown
and
hat
her
eagerness
to
get
the
new
baby
into
her
arms
all
these
told
in
her
favor
and
she
became
very
popular
in
the
shabby
little
settlement
across
the
bridge
she
would
sit
at
a
and
show
old
goodspeed
how
to
turn
a
certain
hem
she
would
prescribe
and
whey
for
the
barnes
baby
she
would
explain
to
ryan
the
french
manner
of
cooking
tough
meat
it
is
true
but
on
the
other
hand
she
let
pale
little
discouraged
weber
of
the
bakery
show
her
how
to
make
a
german
potato
pie
and
when
ryan
mother
old
lynch
knitted
her
a
shawl
with
clean
thin
old
hands
the
tears
came
into
her
bright
eyes
as
she
accepted
the
gift
so
it
was
no
more
than
a
neighborly
after
all
burgoyne
would
fall
into
step
beside
a
factory
girl
walking
home
at
sunset
how
was
it
today
nellie
did
you
speak
to
the
foreman
about
an
opening
for
your
sister
the
rich
interested
voice
would
ask
or
perhaps
some
factory
lad
would
find
her
facing
him
in
a
lane
tell
me
joe
what
all
this
talk
of
trouble
between
you
and
the
lacy
boys
at
the
rink
i
a
widow
too
she
reminded
poor
little
peevy
one
day
i
understand
do
let
me
send
you
the
port
wine
i
used
to
take
after
ellen
was
born
she
begged
one
little
sickly
mother
and
when
she
loaned
george
manning
four
hundred
dollars
to
finish
his
new
house
and
get
his
wife
and
babies
up
from
san
francisco
the
transaction
was
made
palatable
to
george
by
her
encouraging
everyone
borrows
money
for
building
i
assure
you
i
know
my
father
did
repeatedly
when
more
subtle
means
were
required
she
was
still
equal
to
the
occasion
it
was
while
viola
peet
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
burned
wrist
that
burgoyne
made
a
final
and
effective
attempt
to
move
poor
little
peet
out
of
the
bedroom
where
she
had
lain
complaining
ever
since
the
accident
that
had
crippled
her
and
killed
her
husband
five
years
before
burgoyne
put
it
as
a
surprise
for
viola
and
peet
whose
one
surviving
spark
of
interest
in
life
centred
in
her
three
children
finally
permitted
carpenters
to
come
and
build
a
porch
outside
her
and
was
actually
transferred
one
warm
june
afternoon
to
the
wide
delicious
that
burgoyne
had
hung
there
her
eyes
dulled
with
staring
at
a
chocolate
and
a
closet
door
for
five
years
roved
almost
angrily
over
the
stretch
of
village
street
visible
from
the
porch
the
perspective
of
roofs
and
feathery
elm
and
locust
trees
is
a
bit
more
than
i
do
for
you
if
i
was
rich
and
you
poor
said
peet
rebelliously
oh
i
know
that
said
burgoyne
busily
punching
pillows
an
as
you
say
viola
deserves
all
i
do
for
her
pursued
the
invalid
but
remember
every
cent
of
this
you
git
back
every
cent
just
as
soon
as
lyman
is
old
enough
to
take
a
job
agreed
burgoyne
there
how
that
that
the
way
colonel
burgoyne
liked
to
be
fixed
you
to
make
a
note
of
just
what
it
costs
persisted
peet
this
wrapper
and
the
pillers
and
all
oh
let
the
wrapper
be
my
present
to
you
mrs
peet
no
said
peet
firmly
and
she
told
the
neighbors
later
in
the
delightfully
exciting
afternoon
and
evening
that
followed
her
installation
on
the
porch
that
she
was
an
object
of
charity
and
she
and
burgoyne
both
knew
it
burgoyne
would
not
stay
to
see
viola
face
when
she
came
home
from
the
hospital
to
find
her
mother
watching
the
summer
stars
prick
through
the
warm
darkness
but
viola
came
up
to
the
hall
that
same
evening
and
tried
to
thank
burgoyne
and
laughed
and
cried
at
once
and
had
to
be
consoled
with
cookies
and
milk
until
the
smiles
had
the
upper
hand
and
she
could
go
home
with
occasional
reminiscent
sobs
still
shaking
her
bony
little
chest
what
are
you
trying
to
do
over
there
asked
brown
coming
in
with
his
wife
for
a
rubber
of
bridge
as
viola
departed
whereever
i
go
i
come
across
your
trail
are
we
nursing
a
socialist
in
our
bosom
i
do
think
i
that
said
sidney
laughing
and
pushing
the
into
comfortable
relation
let
sit
out
here
until
valentine
comes
no
i
not
a
socialist
but
i
ca
help
feeling
that
there
some
solution
for
a
wretched
problem
like
that
over
there
a
wave
of
the
hand
indicated
old
paloma
and
perhaps
dabbling
aimlessly
about
in
all
sorts
of
places
one
of
us
may
hit
upon
it
but
i
thought
the
modern
theory
was
against
dabbling
said
brown
a
little
timidly
for
she
held
a
theory
that
she
was
not
smart
i
thought
everything
was
being
done
by
institutions
and
by
laws
by
legislation
nothing
will
ever
be
done
by
legislation
to
my
thinking
at
least
burgoyne
said
a
few
years
ago
we
legislated
some
thousands
of
new
babies
into
magnificent
institutions
nurses
mixed
their
bottles
doctors
inspected
them
nurses
turned
them
and
washed
them
and
watched
them
do
you
know
what
percentage
survived
does
work
very
well
said
the
doctor
shaking
a
thoughtful
head
over
his
pipe
just
one
hundred
per
cent
did
survive
said
burgoyne
now
they
take
a
foundling
or
an
otherwise
unfortunate
baby
and
give
it
to
a
real
live
mother
she
nurses
it
if
she
can
she
keeps
near
to
it
and
cuddles
it
and
loves
it
and
so
it
lives
in
all
the
asylums
it
the
same
way
groups
are
getting
smaller
and
smaller
a
dozen
girls
with
a
matron
in
a
cottage
and
hundreds
of
girls
out
with
good
responsible
women
instead
of
enormous
refectories
and
dormitories
and
schoolrooms
and
the
ideal
solution
will
be
when
every
individual
woman
in
the
world
extends
her
mothering
to
include
every
young
thing
she
comes
in
contact
with
one
doll
for
her
own
child
and
another
doll
for
the
ashman
little
girl
one
dimity
for
her
own
debutante
and
another
just
as
dainty
for
the
who
brings
home
the
laundry
every
week
yes
but
that
puttering
here
and
there
asserted
brown
would
laws
for
a
working
wage
do
all
that
and
more
too
in
the
first
place
a
working
wage
does
solve
it
burgoyne
answered
vigorously
because
in
fully
half
the
mismanaged
and
dirty
homes
the
working
people
have
a
working
wage
have
an
amount
of
money
that
would
amaze
you
who
buys
the
willow
plumes
and
the
phonographs
and
the
enlarged
pictures
and
the
hair
combs
and
the
white
shoes
that
are
sold
by
the
million
every
year
the
poor
people
girls
in
shops
and
women
whose
babies
are
always
dirty
and
always
broken
out
with
skin
trouble
and
whose
homes
are
hot
and
dirty
and
miserable
and
mismanaged
well
make
some
laws
to
educate
then
if
it
education
they
all
need
suggested
the
doctor
who
had
been
auditing
every
clause
of
the
last
remark
with
a
thoughtful
nod
no
wages
are
the
question
burgoyne
reiterated
why
i
knew
a
little
swedish
woman
once
who
raised
three
children
on
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
she
could
ejaculated
brown
oh
but
she
did
she
paid
one
dollar
a
week
for
rent
too
one
son
is
a
civil
engineer
now
and
the
daughter
is
a
nurse
the
youngest
is
studying
medicine
but
what
did
they
eat
do
you
suppose
oh
i
do
know
potatoes
i
suppose
and
oatmeal
and
baked
cabbage
and
soup
i
know
she
got
a
quart
of
buttermilk
every
day
for
three
cents
they
were
beautiful
children
they
went
to
free
schools
and
lectures
and
galleries
and
park
concerts
and
free
dispensaries
when
they
needed
them
laws
could
do
no
more
for
her
she
knew
her
business
well
education
would
solve
it
then
concluded
brown
i
do
know
burgoyne
answered
reflectively
book
education
wo
certainly
but
example
might
i
believe
example
would
you
mean
for
people
of
a
better
class
to
go
and
live
among
them
suggested
the
doctor
no
but
i
mean
for
people
of
a
better
class
to
show
them
that
what
they
are
striving
for
is
vital
after
all
i
mean
for
us
to
so
order
our
lives
that
they
will
begin
to
value
cleanliness
and
simplicity
and
the
comforts
they
can
afford
you
know
mary
brown
said
burgoyne
turning
suddenly
to
the
doctor
wife
with
her
gay
characteristic
vehemence
it
all
our
fault
all
the
misery
and
suffering
and
sin
of
it
everywhere
our
fault
you
and
me
cried
brown
aghast
no
all
the
fault
of
women
i
mean
burgoyne
laughed
too
as
brown
settled
back
in
her
chair
with
a
relieved
sigh
we
women
she
went
on
vigorously
have
mismanaged
every
separate
work
that
was
ever
put
into
our
hands
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
live
we
cumber
here
said
the
doctor
smiling
in
lazy
comfort
over
his
pipe
heresy
i
refuse
to
listen
to
it
my
wife
is
a
woman
my
mother
unless
i
am
misinformed
was
another
do
mind
him
said
brown
but
go
on
what
have
we
all
done
we
manage
our
houses
and
dress
our
children
and
feed
our
husbands
it
seems
to
me
well
there
the
big
business
of
motherhood
began
burgoyne
the
holiest
and
highest
thing
god
ever
let
a
mortal
do
we
evade
it
and
ignore
it
to
such
an
extent
that
the
nation
and
other
nations
grows
actually
alarmed
and
men
begin
to
frame
laws
to
coax
us
back
to
the
bearing
of
children
then
if
we
have
them
we
turn
the
entire
responsibility
over
to
other
people
a
raw
little
foreigner
of
some
sort
answers
the
first
questions
our
boys
and
girls
ask
until
they
are
old
enough
to
be
put
under
some
nice
inexperienced
young
girl
just
out
of
normal
school
who
has
fifty
or
sixty
of
them
to
manage
and
of
whose
ideas
upon
the
big
questions
of
life
we
know
absolutely
nothing
we
say
lightheartedly
that
always
go
through
a
trying
age
and
that
we
suppose
boys
to
come
in
contact
with
things
and
we
let
it
go
at
that
we
there
has
always
been
vice
and
always
will
be
but
we
never
stop
to
think
that
we
ourselves
are
setting
the
poor
girls
of
the
other
world
such
an
example
in
the
clothes
we
wear
and
the
pleasures
we
take
that
they
will
sell
even
themselves
for
pretty
gowns
and
theatre
suppers
we
regret
even
while
we
patronize
the
stores
that
support
them
and
we
bemoan
although
i
suppose
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
would
be
to
find
out
where
the
cotton
goes
that
is
worked
by
babies
and
refuse
to
buy
those
brands
of
cotton
and
make
our
merchants
tell
us
where
they
do
get
their
supply
we
have
managed
our
household
problem
so
badly
that
we
simply
ca
get
help
you
can
not
do
your
own
work
with
children
said
brown
firmly
of
course
you
ca
but
why
is
it
that
our
nice
young
american
girls
wo
come
into
our
homes
why
do
we
have
to
depend
upon
the
most
ignorant
and
untrained
of
our
foreign
people
our
girls
pour
into
the
factories
although
our
husbands
do
have
any
trouble
in
getting
their
brothers
for
office
positions
there
is
always
a
line
of
boys
waiting
for
a
possible
job
at
five
dollars
a
week
because
they
can
sleep
at
home
submitted
the
doctor
you
know
that
other
things
being
equal
young
people
would
much
rather
not
sleep
at
home
said
burgoyne
it
the
migrating
age
they
love
the
novelty
of
being
away
at
night
well
when
a
boy
comes
into
my
office
the
doctor
reasoned
slowly
he
knows
that
he
has
certain
unimportant
things
to
do
but
he
sees
me
taking
all
the
real
responsibility
he
knows
that
i
work
harder
than
he
does
exactly
said
burgoyne
men
do
their
own
work
with
help
we
do
do
ours
not
only
that
but
every
improvement
that
comes
to
ours
comes
from
men
they
invent
our
conveniences
they
design
our
stoves
and
arrange
our
sinks
not
because
they
know
anything
about
it
but
because
we
not
interested
one
would
think
you
had
done
your
own
work
for
twenty
years
said
brown
i
never
did
it
burgoyne
answered
smiling
but
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
i
sometimes
envy
those
busy
women
who
have
small
houses
new
babies
money
cares
it
must
be
glorious
to
rise
to
fresh
emergencies
every
hour
of
your
life
a
person
like
myself
is
handicapped
i
demonstrate
that
i
believe
what
i
say
everyone
thinks
me
merely
a
little
affected
about
it
if
i
were
such
a
woman
i
glory
in
clipping
my
life
of
everything
but
the
things
i
needed
and
living
like
one
of
my
own
children
as
simply
as
a
lot
of
peasants
and
no
one
would
ever
be
any
the
wiser
said
brown
i
do
know
quiet
little
isolated
lives
have
a
funny
way
of
getting
out
into
the
light
there
was
that
little
peasant
girl
at
domremy
for
instance
there
was
that
gentle
saint
who
preached
poverty
to
the
birds
there
was
eugenie
guerin
and
the
cure
of
ars
and
the
few
obscure
little
english
weavers
and
there
was
the
president
who
split
i
thought
we
come
to
him
chuckled
the
doctor
well
burgoyne
smiled
a
little
confused
at
having
betrayed
well
and
there
was
one
more
the
greatest
of
all
who
did
found
any
asylums
or
lead
any
crusade
she
paused
surely
said
the
doctor
quietly
surely
i
suppose
that
curing
the
lame
here
and
the
blind
there
and
giving
the
people
their
fill
of
wine
one
day
and
of
bread
and
fishes
the
next
might
be
called
in
these
days
but
the
love
that
went
with
those
things
is
warming
the
world
yet
well
but
what
can
we
do
demanded
brown
after
a
short
silence
that
for
us
to
find
out
said
burgoyne
cheerfully
a
correct
diagnosis
is
half
a
cure
ended
the
doctor
hopefully
chapter
ix
barry
was
the
last
guest
to
reach
holly
hall
on
the
evening
of
burgoyne
first
and
came
in
to
find
the
great
painter
who
was
her
guest
the
centre
of
a
laughing
and
talking
group
in
the
long
apostleman
with
an
open
book
of
reproductions
from
whistler
on
her
broad
brocade
lap
had
the
armchair
next
to
the
guest
of
honor
and
barry
quick
look
for
his
hostess
discovered
her
on
a
low
hassock
at
the
painter
knee
looking
very
young
and
fresh
in
her
white
frock
with
a
lamarque
rose
at
her
belt
and
another
in
her
dark
hair
she
greeted
him
very
gravely
almost
timidly
and
in
the
new
that
had
suddenly
come
to
them
both
it
was
with
difficulty
that
even
the
commonplace
words
of
greeting
were
accomplished
and
it
was
with
evident
relief
that
she
turned
from
him
to
ask
her
guests
to
come
into
the
warm
daylight
was
still
pouring
into
the
at
seven
and
in
the
pleasant
too
there
was
no
other
light
the
windows
here
were
wide
open
and
garden
scents
drifted
in
from
the
recently
watered
the
long
table
simply
set
was
ornamented
only
by
low
bowls
of
the
lovely
san
rafael
roses
guided
and
stimulated
by
the
hostess
the
conversation
ran
in
a
gay
unbroken
stream
for
the
painter
liked
to
talk
and
santa
paloma
enjoyed
him
but
under
it
all
the
women
guests
were
aware
of
an
almost
resentful
amazement
at
the
simplicity
of
the
dinner
when
after
nine
the
ladies
went
into
the
and
settled
about
a
snapping
wood
fire
lloyd
could
not
resist
whispering
to
apostleman
for
a
company
dinner
adams
was
entirely
absorbed
in
deciding
just
what
position
she
would
take
when
white
alluded
to
the
affair
the
next
day
but
white
had
come
primed
for
special
business
this
evening
and
she
took
immediate
advantage
of
the
absence
of
the
men
to
speak
to
burgoyne
as
president
of
our
little
club
said
she
when
they
were
all
seated
i
am
authorized
to
ask
you
if
i
may
put
your
name
up
for
membership
burgoyne
we
are
all
members
here
and
in
this
quiet
place
our
meetings
are
a
real
pleasure
and
i
hope
an
education
as
well
oh
really
burgoyne
began
but
the
other
went
on
serenely
i
brought
one
of
our
yearly
programs
we
have
just
got
them
out
and
i
going
to
leave
it
with
you
i
think
white
left
it
here
on
the
table
yes
here
it
is
you
see
she
opened
a
dainty
little
book
and
flattened
it
with
a
white
jeweled
hand
our
work
is
all
laid
out
up
to
the
president
breakfast
in
march
i
go
out
then
and
a
week
later
we
inaugurate
the
new
president

me

know
it
will
interest
you

said
the
hostess
we
wanted

suggestions

that

of
the
ladies
interested

the
french
class
once
a
week
german
spanish

the

carroll

and
professor
noyesmith
of
berkeley
will
read
a
paper
on
city
beautiful
keep
that
i
butchered
it
running
through
it
so
fast
well
just
now
burgoyne
began
a
little
hesitatingly
rather
busy
i
am
at
the
mail
office
while
the
girls
are
in
school
you
know
and
we
have
laid
out
an
enormous
lot
of
gardening
for
afternoons
they
never
tire
of
gardening
if
i
with
them
but
of
course
no
children
will
do
that
sort
of
thing
alone
and
it
doing
them
both
so
much
good
that
i
do
want
to
stop
it
then
they
study
german
and
italian
with
me
and
on
saturday
have
a
cooking
lesson
you
see
my
time
is
pretty
full
but
a
good
governess
would
take
every
bit
of
that
off
your
hands
me
dear
said
apostleman
oh
but
i
love
to
do
it
protested
burgoyne
with
her
childish
look
you
ca
really
buy
for
them
what
you
can
do
yourself
do
you
think
so
and
now
the
other
children
are
beginning
to
come
in
and
it
such
fun
but
that
is
all
i
have
editorial
work
to
do
besides
the
mail
you
know
i
manage
the
to
mothers
column
in
a
little
eastern
magazine
i
daresay
you
never
seen
it
it
is
quite
unpretentious
but
it
has
a
large
circulation
and
these
mothers
write
me
some
of
them
or
mothers
of
even
or
lonely
women
on
some
isolated
ranch
you
no
idea
how
interesting
it
is
of
course
they
do
know
who
i
am
but
we
become
good
friends
just
the
same
i
have
the
best
reference
books
about
babies
and
sickness
and
i
give
them
the
best
advice
i
can
sometimes
it
a
that
is
wanted
or
a
crib
or
some
dear
old
mother
to
get
into
a
home
and
they
are
so
about
it
and
so
afraid
they
are
paying
fair
i
love
that
work
but
of
course
it
takes
time
then
i
been
hunting
up
a
for
the
girls
i
ca
teach
them
that
i
meant
to
speak
to
you
of
that
white
said
there
a
monsieur
posti
emil
posti
he
studied
with
leschetizky
you
know
who
comes
up
from
san
francisco
every
other
week
and
we
all
take
from
him
in
between
times
oh
but
i
engaged
a
nice
little
miss
davids
from
old
paloma
said
burgoyne
from
old
paloma
echoed
three
women
together
and
apostleman
added
heavily
never
heard
of
her
i
got
a
good
little
swedish
over
there
the
hostess
explained
and
she
told
me
of
this
girl
she
a
sweet
girl
no
mother
and
a
little
sister
to
bring
up
she
was
quite
pleased
but
good
heavens
what
does
she
know
what
her
method
demanded
white
in
puzzled
disapproval
she
has
a
pretty
touch
burgoyne
said
mildly
and
bristling
with
ambition
and
ideas
she
not
a
genius
perhaps
but
then
neither
is
either
of
the
girls
i
just
want
them
to
play
for
their
own
pleasure
read
accompaniments
something
of
that
sort
you
know
how
popular
the
girl
who
can
play
college
songs
always
is
at
a
well
really
white
began
almost
annoyed
but
she
broke
her
sentence
off
abruptly
and
apostleman
filled
the
pause
whatever
made
ye
go
over
there
for
a
she
demanded
we
never
think
of
going
there
there
a
very
good
woman
here
in
the
bank
building
madame
sorrel
supplemented
adams
she
fearfully
independent
lloyd
contributed
but
she
good
she
made
your
pink
did
she
sue
wayne
said
she
did
adams
turned
pink
herself
the
others
laughed
suddenly
oh
you
naughty
girl
white
said
did
you
tell
wayne
you
got
that
frock
in
santa
paloma
what
wayne
does
know
wo
hurt
him
said
his
wife
sh
here
they
come
and
the
conversation
terminated
abruptly
with
much
laughter
burgoyne
dispersed
shortly
after
ten
so
much
earlier
than
was
the
custom
in
santa
paloma
that
none
of
the
ordered
were
in
waiting
the
guests
walked
home
together
absorbed
in
an
animated
conversation
for
the
gentlemen
who
were
delighted
to
be
getting
home
early
delighted
with
a
dinner
that
as
wayne
adams
remarked
really
stood
for
something
to
eat
not
just
things
passed
to
you
or
put
down
in
dabs
before
you
and
delighted
with
the
pleasant
informality
of
sitting
down
in
daylight
were
enthusiastic
in
their
praise
of
burgoyne
the
ladies
differed
with
them
she
knows
how
to
do
things
said
parker
lloyd
old
von
praag
himself
said
that
she
was
a
famous
i
do
know
what
you
say
wayne
said
adams
patiently
if
asked
people
to
sit
down
to
the
dinner
we
had
of
course
we
have
eight
millions
but
i
would
be
ashamed
to
serve
a
cocktail
a
soup
i
frankly
admit
it
was
delicious
steaks
plain
lettuce
salad
and
fruit
i
do
count
coffee
and
cheese
no
wines
no
entrees
i
think
it
was
decidedly
queer
i
wish
some
of
you
others
would
try
it
said
willard
white
unexpectedly
i
never
get
dinners
like
that
except
at
the
club
down
in
town
the
cocktail
was
a
rare
sherry
the
steaks
were
broiled
to
a
turn
and
the
salad
dressing
was
a
wonder
she
had
her
cheese
just
ripe
enough
and
samovar
coffee
to
wind
up
with
what
more
do
you
want
i
serve
wine
myself
but
champagne
keeps
you
thirsty
all
night
and
other
wines
put
me
to
sleep
i
do
miss
wine
i
call
it
a
dinner
do
you
parker
parker
lloyd
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
felt
discretion
his
part
well
he
said
innocently
selecting
the
one
argument
most
distasteful
to
the
ladies
it
was
a
man
dinner
will
it
was
just
what
a
man
likes
served
the
way
he
likes
it
but
if
the
girls
like
flummery
and
fuss
i
do
see
why
they
should
have
it
really
said
white
with
a
laugh
that
showed
a
trace
of
something
not
hilarious
really
you
are
all
too
absurd
we
are
a
long
way
from
the
authorities
here
but
i
think
we
will
find
out
pretty
soon
that
simple
dinners
have
become
the
fad
in
washington
or
paris
and
that
your
marvelous
burgoyne
is
simply
following
the
fashion
like
all
the
rest
of
us
chapter
x
barry
had
murmured
something
about
rush
of
work
at
the
office
when
he
came
in
a
few
minutes
late
for
burgoyne
dinner
but
as
the
evening
wore
on
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
depart
sidney
was
delighted
to
see
him
really
in
his
element
with
the
von
praags
father
and
son
the
awakened
expression
that
was
so
becoming
to
him
on
his
face
and
his
curiously
complex
arguments
stirring
the
old
man
over
and
over
again
to
laughter
she
had
been
vexed
at
herself
for
feeling
a
little
shyness
when
he
first
came
in
the
unfamiliar
evening
dress
and
the
gravity
of
his
handsome
face
had
made
him
seem
almost
a
stranger
but
this
wore
off
and
after
the
other
guests
had
gone
these
four
still
sat
laughing
and
talking
like
the
best
of
old
friends
together
when
the
von
praags
had
gone
upstairs
she
walked
with
him
to
the
porch
and
they
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
for
a
moment
the
rich
scent
of
the
climbing
lamarque
and
banksia
roses
heavy
about
them
and
the
dark
starry
arch
of
the
sky
above
sidney
a
little
tired
but
pleased
with
her
dinner
and
her
guests
and
ready
for
a
breath
of
the
sweet
summer
night
before
going
upstairs
was
confused
by
having
her
heart
suddenly
begin
to
thump
again
she
looked
at
barry
his
figure
lost
in
the
shadow
only
his
face
dimly
visible
in
the
starlight
and
some
feeling
new
young
terrifying
and
yet
infinitely
delicious
rushed
over
her
she
might
have
been
a
girl
of
seventeen
instead
of
a
sober
woman
fifteen
years
older
with
wifehood
and
motherhood
and
widowhood
all
behind
her
a
wonderful
night
said
barry
looking
down
at
the
dark
mass
of
that
almost
hid
the
town
and
at
the
rising
circle
of
shadows
that
was
the
hills
and
a
good
place
to
be
santa
paloma
sidney
added
contentedly
it
my
captured
dream
my
own
home
and
garden
with
her
head
resting
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
porch
her
eyes
dreamily
moving
from
the
hills
to
the
sky
and
over
the
quiet
woods
she
went
on
thoughtfully
you
know
i
never
had
a
home
barry
and
when
i
visited
here
i
began
to
realize
what
i
was
missing
how
i
longed
for
santa
paloma
the
creek
and
the
woods
and
my
little
sunny
room
after
i
went
away
but
even
when
i
was
eighteen
and
we
took
a
house
in
washington
what
could
i
do
i
out
you
know
i
loved
gowns
and
parties
then
as
i
hope
the
girls
will
some
day
but
i
knew
all
the
while
it
was
living
she
paused
but
barry
did
not
speak
and
then
before
i
was
twenty
i
was
married
sidney
went
on
presently
and
we
started
off
for
petersburg
and
after
that
for
years
and
years
i
posed
for
dressmakers
i
went
the
round
of
jewelers
and
milliners
and
manicures
i
wrote
notes
and
paid
calls
i
let
one
strange
woman
come
in
every
day
and
wash
my
hands
for
me
and
another
wash
my
hair
and
a
third
dress
me
i
let
men
who
were
in
the
business
simply
to
make
money
and
who
knew
how
to
do
it
tell
me
that
my
furs
must
be
recut
or
changed
and
my
jewels
reset
and
my
wardrobe
restocked
and
my
furniture
carried
away
and
replaced
and
in
the
cities
we
lived
in
horrifying
to
see
how
women
slave
and
toil
and
worry
to
keep
up
half
the
women
i
knew
were
sick
over
debts
and
the
necessity
for
more
debts
i
felt
like
saying
with
carlyle
must
excuse
me
i
going
back
to
santa
paloma
to
wear
my
things
as
long
as
they
are
whole
and
comfortable
and
do
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
spare
time
you
missed
your
playtime
barry
said
now
you
make
the
most
of
it
oh
no
she
answered
giving
him
a
glimpse
of
serious
eyes
in
the
playtime
does
come
back
but
at
least
i
know
what
i
want
to
do
and
it
will
be
more
fun
than
any
play
one
of
the
wisest
men
i
ever
knew
set
me
thinking
of
these
things
he
a
sculptor
a
great
sculptor
and
he
lives
in
an
olive
garden
in
italy
and
eats
what
his
peasants
eat
and
befriends
them
and
stands
for
their
babies
in
baptism
and
sits
with
them
when
they
dying
my
father
and
i
visited
him
about
two
years
ago
and
one
day
when
he
and
i
were
taking
a
tramp
i
suddenly
burst
out
that
i
envied
him
i
wanted
to
live
in
an
olive
garden
too
and
wear
faded
blue
clothes
and
eat
grapes
and
tramp
about
the
hills
he
said
very
simply
that
he
had
worked
for
twenty
years
to
do
it
see
i
a
rich
man
he
said
it
seems
that
one
must
be
rich
in
this
world
before
one
dare
be
poor
from
choice
i
could
do
this
if
people
did
know
that
i
could
have
an
apartment
in
paris
and
servants
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
it
would
hurt
my
daughters
and
distress
my
friends
there
are
hundreds
and
thousands
of
unhappy
people
in
the
world
who
ca
afford
to
be
poor
and
if
ever
you
get
a
chance
you
try
it
you
never
be
rich
again
so
i
wrote
him
about
a
month
ago
that
i
had
found
my
olive
garden
finished
sidney
contentedly
and
was
enjoying
it
captain
burgoyne
was
older
than
you
sid
barry
questioned
he
have
loved
this
sort
of
life
twenty
years
older
yes
but
he
would
have
lived
here
for
one
day
she
answered
vivaciously
he
was
a
diplomat
a
courtier
to
his
he
was
born
to
the
atmosphere
of
hothouse
flowers
and
salons
and
delightful
little
plots
and
gossip
he
loved
politics
and
power
and
women
in
full
dress
and
men
with
orders
of
course
i
was
very
new
to
it
all
but
he
liked
to
spoil
me
draw
me
out
if
it
had
been
for
his
accident
i
never
would
have
grown
up
at
all
i
dare
say
as
it
was
i
was
more
like
his
mother
we
went
to
washington
for
the
season
new
york
for
the
opera
england
for
autumn
visits
paris
for
the
spring
i
loved
to
make
him
happy
barry
and
he
was
happy
except
when
we
were
going
going
going
he
was
exceptionally
popular
he
had
exceptional
friends
and
he
could
go
anywhere
without
me
my
babies
were
with
his
mother
she
paused
turning
a
white
rose
between
her
fingers
and
afterwards
she
said
presently
there
was
father
and
father
never
would
spend
two
nights
in
the
same
place
if
he
could
help
it
i
was
drawn
back
here
as
you
were
said
barry
thoughtfully
i
liked
new
york
i
could
have
made
good
there
if
i
had
a
chance
it
made
me
sick
to
give
it
up
then
but
lately
i
been
feeling
differently
a
newspaper
a
pretty
influential
thing
wherever
it
is
i
been
thinking
about
that
clubhouse
plan
of
yours
i
wish
to
the
lord
that
we
could
do
something
for
those
poor
kids
over
there
right
those
girls
have
rotten
homes
the
whole
family
gathers
in
the
parlor
right
after
dinner
pa
takes
his
shoes
off
and
props
his
socks
up
before
the
stove
ma
begins
to
hear
a
kid
his
spelling
and
other
kids
start
the
graphophone
and
aggie
is
expected
to
ask
her
young
man
to
walk
right
in
so
after
that
she
meets
him
in
the
street
and
the
girls
begin
to
talk
about
aggie
oh
barry
i
so
glad
you
interested
standing
a
step
above
him
sidney
ardent
face
was
very
close
to
his
own
of
course
we
can
do
it
she
said
we
he
echoed
almost
bitterly
you
do
it
you
the
one
he
broke
off
with
a
short
embarrassed
laugh
i
was
going
to
cut
that
sort
of
thing
out
he
said
gruffly
but
all
roads
lead
to
rome
it
seems
i
ca
talk
to
you
five
minutes
without
and
i
got
to
go
i
said
i
look
in
at
the
office
you
seem
to
be
afraid
to
be
friendly
lately
barry
said
burgoyne
in
a
hurt
voice
flinging
away
the
rose
she
had
been
holding
but
do
you
think
our
friendship
means
something
to
me
too
i
like
you
to
talk
as
if
i
did
all
the
giving
and
you
all
the
taking
i
do
know
how
the
girls
and
i
would
get
along
without
your
advice
and
help
here
at
the
hall
i
think
her
voice
broke
into
a
troubled
laugh
i
think
you
forget
that
the
quality
of
friendship
is
not
strained
sidney
he
said
with
sudden
resolution
turning
to
face
her
bravely
i
ca
be
just
friends
with
you
you
so
much
the
finest
so
much
the
best
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
began
again
you
have
a
hundred
men
friends
you
ca
realize
what
you
mean
to
me
you
but
you
know
what
you
are
and
i
the
editor
of
a
mortgaged
country
paper
a
man
who
has
made
a
mess
of
things
who
ca
take
care
of
his
kid
or
himself
on
his
job
without
help
barry
she
began
breathlessly
but
he
interrupted
her
listen
to
me
he
said
huskily
taking
both
her
warm
hands
in
his
i
want
to
tell
you
something
say
that
i
was
weak
enough
to
forget
all
that
your
money
and
my
poverty
your
life
and
my
life
everything
that
puts
you
as
far
above
me
as
the
moon
and
stars
say
that
i
could
do
that
although
i
hope
it
not
true
even
then
even
then
i
not
free
sidney
there
is
hetty
you
know
there
is
billy
mother
there
was
a
silence
sidney
slowly
freed
her
hands
laid
one
upon
her
heart
as
unconsciously
as
a
hurt
child
and
the
other
upon
his
shoulder
her
troubled
eyes
searched
his
face
barry
she
said
with
a
little
effort
have
i
been
mistaken
in
thinking
billy
mother
was
dead
everyone
thinks
so
he
answered
with
a
quick
rush
of
words
that
showed
how
great
the
relief
of
speech
was
even
up
in
hetty
home
town
plumas
they
think
so
i
wrote
home
that
hetty
had
left
me
and
they
drew
their
own
conclusions
it
was
natural
enough
she
was
never
strong
she
was
always
restless
and
unhappy
wanted
to
go
on
the
stage
she
did
go
on
the
stage
you
know
her
mother
advised
it
and
she
just
left
me
we
were
in
new
york
then
bill
was
a
little
shaver
i
was
having
a
hard
time
with
a
new
job
it
was
an
awful
time
after
a
few
months
i
brought
bill
back
here
he
was
very
well
and
then
i
found
that
everyone
thought
hetty
was
dead
then
her
mother
wrote
me
and
said
that
hetty
had
taken
a
and
begged
me
to
let
people
go
on
thinking
she
was
dead
and
more
for
the
kid
sake
than
hetty
i
let
things
stand
but
hetty
in
california
now
she
and
her
mother
live
in
san
francisco
she
is
still
studying
singing
i
believe
she
gets
the
rent
from
two
flats
i
have
there
but
she
never
writes
and
that
he
finished
grimly
is
the
last
chapter
of
my
history
sidney
still
stood
close
to
him
earnest
fragrant
lovely
in
her
white
gown
and
even
above
the
troubled
tumult
of
his
thoughts
barry
had
time
to
think
how
honest
how
unaffected
she
was
to
stand
so
making
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
confusion
in
her
own
mind
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
sound
but
the
vague
stir
of
the
night
about
them
the
faint
breath
of
some
wandering
breeze
the
rustling
flight
of
some
small
animal
in
the
dark
the
village
sounds
thank
you
barry
sidney
said
at
length
i
sorry
i
am
glad
you
told
me
he
said
almost
inaudibly
he
ran
down
the
steps
and
plunged
into
the
dark
avenue
without
a
backward
look
sidney
turned
slowly
and
slowly
entered
the
dimly
lighted
hall
and
shut
the
door
chapter
xi
come
down
here
we
down
by
the
river
called
burgoyne
from
the
shade
of
the
river
bank
where
she
and
lloyd
were
busy
with
their
sewing
the
american
history
section
is
entertaining
the
club
you
look
studious
laughed
brown
coming
across
the
grass
to
put
the
brown
baby
upon
his
own
sturdy
legs
from
her
tired
arms
and
sink
into
a
deep
lawn
chair
the
june
afternoon
was
warm
but
it
was
delightfully
cool
by
the
water
is
that
the
club
she
asked
waving
toward
the
group
of
children
who
were
wading
and
splashing
in
the
shallows
of
the
loitering
river
that
the
american
history
club
responded
burgoyne
as
she
flung
her
sewing
aside
and
snatched
the
baby
paul
said
she
kissing
his
warm
moist
neck
do
you
truly
love
me
a
little
bit
boy
ge
down
said
paul
struggling
violently
yes
you
shall
darling
but
listen
do
you
want
to
hear
the
oh
paul
sit
still
just
one
minute
awn
ge
down
said
paul
distinctly
every
fibre
of
his
small
being
headed
as
it
were
for
the
pebbly
shingle
where
it
was
daily
his
delight
to
dig
but
say
first
sweetheart
say
i
love
you
besought
the
mistress
of
the
hall
deck
shouted
paul
obediently
eyes
on
the
river
and
a
sweet
kiss
further
stipulated
burgoyne
and
grabbed
it
from
his
small
red
unresponsive
mouth
before
she
let
him
toddle
away
yes
she
resumed
going
on
with
the
tucking
of
a
small
skirt
joanna
and
jeanette
and
the
adams
boy
have
to
write
an
essay
this
week
about
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
so
i
read
them
holmes
poem
and
they
acted
it
all
out
you
never
saw
anything
so
delicious
lloyd
came
up
just
in
time
to
see
mabel
limping
about
as
the
old
corporal
the
cherry
tree
was
the
steeple
of
course
and
both
your
sons
you
be
ashamed
to
hear
were
redcoats
next
week
they
expect
to
do
paul
revere
and
i
daresay
we
have
the
entire
war
before
we
through
you
are
both
cordially
invited
i
come
said
the
doctor
wife
smiling
i
love
this
garden
and
to
take
care
of
the
boys
and
have
a
good
time
myself
is
more
than
i
ever
thought
i
do
in
this
life
i
live
on
this
bank
said
burgoyne
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
her
big
chair
to
stare
idly
up
through
the
to
the
blue
sky
i
going
to
teach
the
children
all
their
history
and
poetry
and
myths
out
here
it
makes
it
so
real
to
them
to
act
it
jo
and
ellen
and
i
read
barbara
frietchie
out
here
a
few
weeks
ago
and
wanted
it
every
day
or
two
since
we
wo
leave
anything
for
the
schools
to
do
said
little
brown
all
the
better
burgoyne
said
cheerfully
well
excuse
me
lloyd
holding
the
linen
cuff
she
was
embroidering
at
arm
length
and
studying
it
between
lids
i
am
only
too
glad
to
turn
mabel
over
to
somebody
else
part
of
the
time
you
do
know
what
she
is
when
she
begins
to
ask
questions
i
do
know
anything
more
tiring
than
being
with
children
day
in
and
day
out
said
brown
it
gets
frightfully
on
your
nerves
oh
i
like
about
twelve
said
burgoyne
oh
burgoyne
you
would
yes
i
would
granted
a
moderately
secure
income
and
a
rather
roomy
country
home
although
added
burgoyne
temperately
i
do
honestly
think
twelve
children
is
too
big
a
family
however
one
may
be
greedy
in
wishes
would
you
want
a
child
of
yours
to
go
without
proper
advantages
said
lloyd
a
little
severely
would
you
want
more
than
one
or
two
if
you
honestly
felt
you
could
give
them
all
that
other
children
have
would
you
be
perfectly
willing
to
have
your
children
feel
at
a
disadvantage
with
all
the
children
of
your
friends
i
would
she
answered
herself
positively
i
want
to
do
the
best
by
mabel
i
want
her
to
have
everything
as
she
grows
up
that
a
girl
ought
to
have
that
why
all
this
nonsense
about
the
size
of
the
american
family
makes
me
so
tired
what
the
use
of
bringing
a
lot
of
children
into
the
world
that
are
going
to
suffer
all
sorts
of
privations
when
they
get
here
privations
would
hurt
them
said
burgoyne
sturdily
if
it
was
only
a
question
of
patched
boots
and
clothes
and
plain
food
they
could
even
have
everything
in
the
world
that
worth
while
how
do
you
mean
said
lloyd
promptly
defensive
i
gather
them
about
me
mused
sidney
burgoyne
dreamily
her
eyes
on
the
sky
a
whimsical
smile
playing
about
her
mouth
i
gather
all
seven
together
oh
you
come
down
to
seven
chuckled
brown
well
seven
a
good
biblical
number
burgoyne
said
serenely
and
i
say
all
music
is
yours
all
art
is
yours
all
literature
is
yours
all
history
and
all
philosophy
is
waiting
to
prove
to
you
that
in
starting
poor
healthy
and
born
of
intelligent
and
devoted
parents
you
have
a
long
in
the
race
of
life
all
life
is
ahead
of
you
friendships
work
play
tramps
through
the
green
country
in
the
spring
fires
in
winter
nights
under
the
summer
stars
choose
what
you
like
and
work
for
it
your
father
and
i
can
keep
you
warm
and
fed
through
your
childhoods
and
after
that
nothing
can
stop
you
if
you
are
willing
to
work
and
wait
and
then
suppose
your
son
asks
you
why
he
ca
go
camping
with
the
other
boys
in
summer
school
and
your
daughter
wants
to
join
the
cotillion
asked
lloyd
why
it
would
hurt
them
to
hear
me
say
no
said
burgoyne
in
surprise
i
never
can
understand
why
parents
who
practise
every
imaginable
themselves
are
always
afraid
the
first
renunciation
will
kill
their
child
sooner
or
later
they
are
going
to
learn
what
life
is
i
know
a
little
girl
whose
parents
are
and
who
is
going
to
be
told
some
day
soon
that
her
two
older
sisters
are
living
abroad
as
she
thinks
but
shut
up
for
life
within
a
few
miles
of
her
what
worse
blow
could
life
give
to
the
poorest
girl
horrors
murmured
brown
and
those
are
common
cases
burgoyne
said
eagerly
i
knew
of
so
many
pretty
little
girls
at
european
whose
mothers
are
spending
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
get
out
of
their
blood
what
no
earthly
power
can
do
away
with
sons
of
rich
fathers
whose
valets
themselves
would
change
places
with
them
and
then
the
fine
clean
industrious
or
upper
classes
really
for
the
blood
in
their
veins
is
the
finest
in
the
world
are
afraid
to
bring
children
into
the
world
because
of
dancing
cotillions
and
well
of
course
i
have
only
four
said
brown
but
i
been
married
only
seven
years
burgoyne
laughed
came
to
a
full
stop
and
reddened
a
little
as
she
went
back
busily
to
her
sewing
why
do
you
let
me
run
on
at
such
a
rate
you
know
my
hobbies
now
she
reproached
them
i
am
not
quite
sane
on
the
subject
of
what
ought
to
be
done
and
is
in
that
good
old
institution
called
woman
sphere
that
sounds
vaguely
familiar
said
lloyd
woman
sphere
yes
we
hate
the
sound
of
it
said
burgoyne
just
as
a
man
who
has
left
his
family
hates
to
talk
of
home
ties
and
just
as
a
deserter
hates
the
conversation
to
come
around
to
the
army
but
it
true
our
business
is
children
and
kitchens
and
husbands
and
meals
and
we
detest
it
all
i
like
my
husband
a
little
said
brown
in
a
meek
little
voice
they
all
laughed
then
said
lloyd
gazing
sentimentally
toward
the
river
bank
where
her
small
daughter
twisted
curls
were
tossing
madly
in
a
game
of
tag
i
shall
henceforth
regard
mabel
as
a
possible
joan
of
arc
one
of
those
boys
may
be
a
lincoln
or
a
thomas
edison
or
a
mark
twain
sidney
burgoyne
added
and
then
we
feel
just
a
little
ashamed
for
having
turned
him
complacently
over
to
a
nurse
or
a
boarding
school
of
course
it
leaves
us
free
to
go
to
the
club
and
hear
a
paper
on
the
childhood
of
napoleon
carefully
compiled
years
after
his
death
why
men
take
heavy
chances
in
their
work
they
follow
up
the
slightest
opening
but
we
women
throw
away
opportunities
to
be
great
every
day
of
our
lives
scientists
and
theorists
are
spending
years
of
their
lives
pondering
over
every
separate
phase
of
the
development
of
children
but
we
who
have
the
actual
material
in
our
hands
turn
it
over
to
nursemaids
yes
but
lots
of
children
disappoint
their
parents
bitterly
said
brown
and
lots
of
good
mothers
have
bad
children
i
never
knew
a
good
mother
to
have
a
bad
child
began
burgoyne
well
i
have
thousands
lloyd
said
promptly
oh
no
not
a
bad
child
her
hostess
said
quickly
a
disappointing
child
perhaps
or
a
child
you
mean
but
no
good
mother
and
that
does
mean
merely
a
good
woman
or
a
woman
could
possibly
have
a
really
bad
child
their
fruits
you
know
and
then
of
course
we
have
a
perfect
system
of
nursery
training
yet
we
expect
angels
we
judge
by
little
inessential
things
we
exacting
about
unimportant
trifles
we
do
want
our
sons
to
marry
little
dolls
although
the
dolls
may
make
them
very
good
wives
we
do
want
them
to
make
a
success
of
real
estate
if
the
tradition
of
the
house
is
for
the
bar
or
the
practice
of
medicine
and
we
lose
heart
at
the
first
suspicion
of
bad
company
or
of
drinking
although
the
best
men
in
the
world
had
those
temptations
to
fight
but
anyway
i
would
rather
try
at
that
and
fail
than
do
anything
else
in
the
world
my
failures
at
least
might
save
some
other
woman
children
and
it
just
that
much
more
done
for
the
world
than
guarding
the
valuable
life
of
a
pomeranian
or
going
to
new
york
for
new
furs
they
all
laughed
for
willard
white
latest
announcement
of
her
plans
had
awakened
some
comment
among
them
mother
am
i
interrupting
you
said
a
patient
voice
at
this
point
ellen
burgoyne
rosy
dishevelled
panting
stood
some
ten
feet
away
waiting
patiently
a
chance
to
enter
the
conversation
no
my
darling
her
mother
held
out
a
welcoming
hand
oh
i
see
she
added
glancing
at
her
watch
it
four
yes
you
can
go
up
for
the
gingerbread
now
you
must
carry
the
milk
you
know
ellen
mother
said
ellen
flashing
into
radiance
at
the
slightest
encouragement
have
you
told
them
about
our
flower
festibul
plans
oh
not
yet
burgoyne
heaved
a
great
sigh
i
afraid
committed
myself
to
an
entry
for
the
parade
she
told
the
others
ruefully
oh
do
tell
me
you
going
to
compete
exclaimed
brown
well
we
rather
afraid
we
are
burgoyne
voice
if
fearful
was
hopeful
too
for
ellen
face
was
a
study
why
is
it
such
a
terrible
effort
oh
yes
it
an
appalling
amount
of
struggle
and
fuss
there
all
sorts
of
red
tape
and
the
flowers
are
so
messy
answered
the
wife
warningly
and
this
year
will
be
worse
than
ever
the
club
of
apple
creek
is
going
to
enter
a
carriage
and
you
know
our
club
is
to
have
the
white
motor
it
will
be
perfectly
exquisite
it
to
be
all
pink
carnations
and
white
nephew
a
berkeley
boy
and
some
of
his
friends
all
in
white
flannels
are
going
to
run
it
doctor
says
there
be
a
hundred
entries
this
year
well
i
afraid
i
in
for
it
said
burgoyne
with
a
sigh
i
have
the
least
idea
in
the
world
what
i
going
to
do
it
is
as
if
we
even
had
a
surrey
but
i
really
was
involved
before
i
had
time
to
think
you
know
i
been
trying
with
some
of
my
spare
time
her
eyes
twinkled
to
get
hold
of
these
little
factory
and
cannery
girls
over
in
old
paloma
you
told
me
said
brown
but
i
do
see
how
that
well
you
see
their
ringleader
has
been
particularly
ungracious
to
me
a
fine
superb
big
creature
she
is
named
alice
carter
this
alice
came
up
to
the
children
and
me
in
the
street
the
other
day
and
told
me
in
the
gruffest
manner
that
she
was
interested
in
a
little
crippled
girl
over
there
and
had
promised
to
take
her
to
see
the
flower
festival
but
it
seems
the
child
mother
was
afraid
to
trust
her
to
alice
in
the
crowd
and
heat
quite
simply
she
asked
me
if
i
could
manage
it
i
was
tremendously
touched
and
we
went
to
see
the
child
she
a
poor
brave
little
scrap
twelve
years
old
did
she
say
baby
going
on
thirteen
said
ellen
rapidly
and
her
father
is
dead
and
her
mother
works
and
she
takes
care
of
such
a
fat
baby
and
she
is
very
with
him
is
she
mother
and
she
cried
when
mother
gave
her
books
and
she
ca
eat
her
lunch
because
her
back
aches
but
she
gave
the
baby
his
lunch
and
mother
asked
her
if
she
would
let
a
doctor
fix
her
back
and
she
said
no
did
she
mother
she
just
twisted
and
twisted
her
hands
and
said
ca
and
mother
said
if
you
will
be
a
brave
girl
about
the
doctor
i
will
make
you
a
pink
dress
and
a
wreath
of
roses
and
you
shall
ride
with
the
others
in
the
flower
festibul
and
she
just
said
she
mother
and
she
said
she
thought
god
sent
you
did
she
mother
she
did
burgoyne
smiled
through
wet
lashes
brown
wiped
her
own
eyes
against
the
baby
fluffy
mop
she
a
most
pathetic
little
creature
this
mary
scott
went
on
the
other
woman
when
ellen
had
dashed
away
and
i
afraid
she
not
the
only
one
there
my
miss
davids
little
sister
if
i
took
her
in
miss
davids
would
be
free
for
the
day
and
there
a
little
whose
mother
runs
the
bakery
and
i
told
mary
we
manage
the
baby
too
and
that
if
she
knew
any
other
children
who
positively
could
come
any
other
way
she
must
let
me
know
of
course
the
school
children
are
cared
for
they
will
have
seats
right
near
the
grand
stand
and
sing
and
so
on
but
i
am
really
terrified
about
it
you
have
to
help
me
out
i
do
anything
brown
promised
i
do
anything
i
can
said
lloyd
modestly
i
loathe
and
abominate
children
unless
they
decently
dressed
and
smell
of
soap
but
i
run
a
machine
if
some
one
see
that
they
do
swarm
over
me
i
put
a
barbed
wire
fence
around
you
promised
burgoyne
gaily
carew
coming
up
as
she
expressed
it
to
gather
up
some
children
was
decidedly
optimistic
about
the
plan
nobody
ever
uses
hydrangeas
because
you
ca
make
artificial
ones
to
fill
in
with
she
said
so
you
can
get
barrels
of
them
burgoyne
was
enthusiastic
over
hydrangeas
but
it
not
the
fancy
touches
that
scare
me
she
confessed
it
the
awful
practical
side
what
does
barry
think
carew
presently
asked
innocently
burgoyne
suddenly
rosy
face
was
not
unobserved
by
any
of
the
others
i
have
seen
him
for
several
days
not
since
the
night
of
my
dinner
she
admitted
i
been
lazy
sending
my
work
down
to
the
office
but
i
will
see
him
right
away
he
the
one
really
to
have
ideas
brown
assured
her
chapter
xii
so
barry
was
invited
up
to
the
hall
to
dinner
and
found
himself
so
instantly
swept
into
the
plan
that
he
had
no
time
to
be
dinner
was
served
on
the
side
porch
and
the
sunlight
filtered
across
the
white
cloth
and
turned
the
garden
into
a
place
of
enchantment
when
billy
and
the
small
girls
had
seized
two
cookies
and
two
peaches
apiece
and
retired
to
the
lawn
to
enjoy
them
he
and
sidney
sat
talking
on
in
the
pleasant
dusk
you
asked
eight
so
far
he
said
as
she
was
departing
for
the
office
an
hour
or
so
after
dinner
was
finished
but
do
you
think
that
all
oh
it
positively
must
be
sidney
said
virtuously
but
there
was
a
wicked
gleam
in
her
eye
that
prepared
him
for
her
sudden
descent
upon
the
office
two
days
later
with
the
startling
news
that
now
she
had
positively
stopped
but
fourteen
children
had
been
asked
barry
rather
to
her
surprise
remained
calm
well
i
got
an
idea
he
said
presently
that
will
make
that
all
right
fourteen
children
or
twenty
it
wo
make
any
difference
only
it
may
not
appeal
to
you
oh
it
will
and
you
are
an
angel
said
the
lady
fervently
i
got
a
friend
up
the
country
here
in
a
barry
explained
joe
painter
he
hauls
logs
down
from
the
forest
to
the
river
with
a
team
of
eight
oxen
now
if
he
lend
them
and
you
got
a
from
old
paloma
you
would
have
any
trouble
at
all
oh
but
barry
she
gasped
her
face
radiant
would
he
lend
them
i
think
he
would
he
have
to
come
too
you
know
and
drive
them
i
ride
up
and
see
anyway
oxen
mused
burgoyne
how
perfectly
glorious
the
children
will
go
wild
with
joy
and
you
see
my
indian
boys
your
what
i
did
mention
them
said
sidney
serenely
because
they
walk
alongside
and
wo
count
in
the
load
but
you
see
some
of
those
nice
little
who
do
go
to
school
heard
the
girls
talking
about
it
and
one
of
them
asked
me
so
wistfully
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
i
immediately
thought
of
indian
costumes
but
how
the
deuce
will
you
get
the
costumes
made
said
barry
drawing
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
and
beginning
some
calculations
with
an
anxious
eye
why
it
just
for
the
girls
brown
and
i
have
our
machines
up
in
the
barn
and
carew
and
adams
will
come
up
and
help
there
not
much
to
that
barry
if
you
will
really
get
us
this
this
nothing
else
will
worry
me
at
all
you
have
to
put
the
beasts
up
in
your
barn
oh
surely
ask
him
what
they
eat
oh
barry
we
must
have
them
think
how
picturesque
they
be
i
been
thinking
my
entry
would
be
a
disgrace
to
the
parade
but
i
do
believe
it
will
be
so
bad
barry
when
will
we
know
about
it
you
can
count
on
it
i
guess
joe
wo
refuse
barry
said
with
his
lazy
smile
oh
you
an
angel
i
going
shopping
this
instant
barry
there
will
be
room
now
for
my
ellen
and
billy
and
dicky
carew
wo
there
it
seems
their
hearts
are
bursting
with
the
desire
bunting
murmured
sidney
beginning
a
list
pink
blue
and
cream
bolts
of
it
twine
beads
leather
feathers
some
big
white
hats
extra
milk
hold
on
what
for
why
they
have
to
have
something
to
eat
afterward
she
reproached
him
we
going
to
have
a
picnic
up
at
the
hall
then
those
that
can
will
join
their
people
for
the
fireworks
and
the
others
will
be
taken
home
to
old
paloma
the
little
scott
girl
will
stay
with
ellen
and
jo
overnight
mammy
currey
will
look
after
them
and
they
watch
the
fireworks
from
my
porch
i
written
to
ask
doctor
young
he
the
best
in
san
francisco
to
come
up
from
the
city
next
day
to
see
what
he
thinks
can
be
done
for
mary
scott
you
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
your
money
do
you
sidney
said
barry
watching
her
amusedly
as
she
tucked
the
list
into
her
purse
and
arose
with
a
great
air
of
business
more
than
any
one
woman
deserves
she
answered
soberly
walter
said
anne
pratt
to
her
brother
one
evening
about
this
time
as
she
decorously
filled
his
plate
from
the
silver
tureen
have
you
heard
that
burgoyne
has
gathered
up
about
twenty
children
in
old
paloma
cripples
and
orphans
and
i
do
know
what
all
and
is
getting
up
a
wagon
for
the
flower
festival
i
was
up
at
the
hall
and
they
working
like
beavers
carew
said
something
about
it
said
walter
pratt
seems
a
good
idea
those
poor
little
kids
over
there
do
have
much
fun
you
never
said
so
before
walter
his
sister
returned
almost
resentfully
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
said
walter
literally
it
true
if
we
did
anything
for
any
children
it
ought
to
be
lizzie
said
miss
pratt
uncomfortably
after
a
pause
i
wish
to
the
lord
we
could
do
something
for
lizzie
kids
her
brother
observed
suddenly
i
suppose
it
would
kill
you
to
have
up
here
kill
me
miss
anne
echoed
with
painful
eagerness
and
with
a
sudden
tremble
of
her
thin
long
hand
i
do
know
why
it
should
there
never
were
better
behaved
children
born
i
do
like
lizzie
husband
and
never
shall
she
rushed
on
but
seeing
those
children
up
at
the
hall
made
me
think
of
betty
and
hope
and
davy
cooped
up
down
there
in
town
they
love
the
flower
festival
and
i
could
take
them
up
to
the
hall
and
nanny
would
be
wild
with
joy
to
have
children
here
she
bake
cookies
and
gingerbread
a
flush
had
come
into
her
faded
cool
cheek
would
they
be
in
your
way
you
really
would
mind
you
wo
change
your
mind
about
it
walt
she
said
timidly
change
my
mind
why
i
love
to
have
them
running
round
here
he
answered
warmly
write
lizzie
and
tell
her
i
got
to
go
down
tuesday
and
i
bring
up
i
tell
her
that
just
the
things
they
have
will
be
quite
good
enough
said
miss
pratt
the
burgoyne
children
just
wear
i
get
them
anything
else
they
need
it
wo
interfere
with
your
club
work
anne
not
in
the
least
she
was
sure
of
that
and
anyway
she
went
on
decidedly
i
not
going
to
the
club
so
much
this
summer
mary
brown
and
i
went
yesterday
and
there
was
well
i
suppose
it
was
a
good
paper
on
mind
of
the
child
by
miss
sarah
rich
but
it
seemed
so
flat
and
mary
brown
said
coming
away
think
doctor
and
i
will
still
come
to
the
monthly
receptions
but
i
believe
i
wo
listen
to
any
more
papers
like
that
they
all
very
well
for
people
who
have
no
children
well
by
tuesday
night
you
have
three
said
walter
with
what
was
for
him
great
gaiety
of
manner
walter
his
sister
suggested
nervously
you
be
awfully
affectionate
with
lizzie
wo
you
be
sure
to
tell
her
that
we
want
them
and
tell
her
that
they
be
playing
up
at
the
hall
all
summer
as
we
used
to
you
know
i
been
thinking
walter
went
on
the
poor
lady
with
her
nose
suddenly
growing
red
and
her
eyes
watering
that
i
not
been
a
very
good
sister
to
lizzie
she
the
youngest
and
mother
mother
was
here
to
advise
her
about
her
marriage
and
and
now
i
do
write
her
and
she
wrote
me
that
betty
had
a
cough
and
davy
was
so
noisy
indoors
in
wet
weather
and
i
just
go
to
the
club
to
hear
papers
upon
and
mind
of
the
child
and
miss
anne
beginning
to
cry
outright
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
well
anne
well
anne
her
brother
said
huskily
we
make
it
up
now
where
are
you
going
to
put
them
he
presently
added
with
an
inspiration
miss
pratt
straightened
up
blew
her
nose
wiped
her
eyes
and
rang
for
the
maid
betty
and
hope
in
the
big
front
room
she
began
happily
another
brief
conversation
this
time
between
george
carew
and
his
wife
was
indicative
of
a
certain
change
of
that
was
affecting
the
women
of
santa
paloma
in
these
days
carew
coming
home
one
evening
found
a
very
demure
and
charming
figure
seated
on
the
porch
carew
gown
was
simplicity
itself
a
thin
dotted
dark
blue
silk
with
a
deep
childish
lace
collar
and
cuffs
you
look
terribly
sweet
jen
said
carew
you
look
out
of
sight
and
when
he
came
downstairs
again
and
they
were
at
dinner
he
returned
to
the
subject
with
jen
i
have
seen
you
look
so
sweet
for
a
long
time
what
is
that
a
new
dress
is
that
for
the
reception
on
the
fourth
jen
did
you
have
a
dress
like
that
when
we
were
first
married
sorrel
made
this
and
it
only
cost
sixty
dollars
said
carew
well
get
her
to
make
you
another
her
husband
said
approvingly
at
which
carew
laughed
a
little
shakily
and
came
around
the
table
and
put
her
arms
about
him
and
said
oh
george
you
dear
old
bat
miss
pomeroy
made
this
upstairs
here
in
three
days
and
the
silk
cost
nine
dollars
i
did
have
a
dress
like
this
in
my
trousseau
my
first
silk
and
i
thought
it
was
wonderful
and
i
think

darling

remember
it
and
i
am
going
to
wear
this
on
the
fourth

nice
enough

the
prettiest

carew
positively
chapter
xiii
the
earliest
daylight
of
july
fourth
found
santa
paloma
already
astir
dew
was
heavy
on
the
ropes
of
flowers
and
greens
and
the
flags
and
bunting
that
made
brilliant
all
the
line
of
the
day
march
and
long
scarfs
of
fog
lingered
on
the
hills
but
for
all
that
and
despite
the
delicious
fragrant
chill
of
the
morning
air
nobody
doubted
that
the
day
would
be
hot
and
cloudless
and
the
evening
perfect
for
fireworks
began
to
whir
busily
in
the
sweet
shaded
gardens
long
before
the
sunlight
reached
them
windows
and
doors
were
flung
open
to
the
air
women
sweeping
and
sidewalks
with
gay
energy
called
greetings
up
and
down
the
street
to
one
another
chairs
were
dragged
limp
flags
began
to
stir
in
the
sunny
air
other
flags
squeakily
mounted
their
poles
at
every
window
bunting
showed
the
schoolhouse
was
in
red
white
and
blue
the
clubhouse
was
festooned
with
evergreens
and
japanese
lanterns
and
the
mail
office
the
grand
stand
opposite
the
shops
and
the
bank
all
fluttered
with
gay
colors
children
shouted
and
scampered
everywhere
gathered
in
fascinated
groups
about
the
and
candy
and
popcorn
booths
that
sprang
up
at
every
corner
met
arriving
cousins
and
aunts
at
the
train
ran
on
errands
occasionally
a
whole
package
of
exploding
firecrackers
smote
the
warm
still
air
by
ten
every
window
on
the
line
of
march
every
dooryard
and
porch
had
its
group
of
watchers
wagons
and
from
the
surrounding
villages
and
ranches
blocked
the
side
streets
it
was
very
warm
and
fans
and
lemonade
had
a
lively
sale
from
the
two
available
windows
of
the
mail
office
three
persons
as
eager
as
the
most
eager
child
watched
the
gathering
crowds
and
waited
for
the
flower
parade
they
were
apostleman
stately
in
black
lace
and
regally
fanning
sidney
burgoyne
looking
her
very
prettiest
in
crisp
white
with
a
scarlet
scarf
over
her
arm
and
barry
valentine
who
looked
unusually
festive
himself
in
white
flannels
all
three
were
in
wild
spirits
hark
here
they
come
said
sidney
at
last
drawing
her
head
in
from
a
long
inspection
of
the
street
she
had
been
waving
and
calling
greetings
in
every
direction
for
a
pleasant
now
eleven
had
boomed
from
the
clock
and
a
general
restlessness
and
wiltedness
began
to
affect
the
waiting
crowds
barry
immediately
dangled
almost
his
entire
length
across
the
window
sill
and
screwed
his
person
about
for
a
look
dey
come
miss
sho
yo
bawn
he
announced
joyfully
there
the
band
here
they
came
sure
enough
under
the
flags
and
garlands
through
the
noonday
heat
only
vague
brassy
notes
and
the
general
craning
of
necks
indicated
their
approach
now
but
in
another
five
minutes
the
uniformed
band
was
actually
in
view
and
the
national
guard
after
it
tremendously
popular
and
the
native
sons
with
another
band
and
the
veterans
thin
old
men
in
half
a
dozen
carriages
and
more
open
carriages
one
held
the
governor
and
his
wife
the
former
bowing
and
smiling
right
and
left
and
saluted
by
the
rising
school
children
when
he
seated
himself
in
the
judges
stand
with
the
shrill
thrilling
notes
of
the
national
anthem
and
then
another
band
and
at
last
the
carriages
and
motors
a
long
wonderful
brilliant
line
of
them
children
in
pretty
girls
in
a
setting
of
scarlet
carnations
more
pretty
girls
in
bobbing
and
nodding
daisies
every
one
more
charming
than
the
last
there
were
white
horses
as
dazzling
as
soap
and
powder
could
make
them
horses
whose
black
flanks
glistened
as
dark
as
coal
and
there
was
a
tandem
of
horses
that
tossed
rosettes
of
pink
shirley
poppies
in
their
ears
the
whites
covered
with
pink
carnations
and
filled
with
lads
flying
the
colors
of
the
women
club
and
the
nation
flag
won
a
special
round
of
applause
burgoyne
and
barry
loyally
clapped
for
the
pratt
from
which
joanna
burgoyne
and
lizzie
pratt
children
were
beaming
upon
the
world
but
what
are
they
halting
for
and
what
are
they
clapping
sidney
presently
demanded
when
a
break
in
the
line
and
a
sudden
outburst
of
cheering
and
applause
interrupted
the
parade
barry
again
hung
at
a
dangerous
angle
from
the
window
presently
he
sat
back
his
face
one
broad
smile
it
us
he
remarked
simply
wait
until
you
see
us
we
the
cream
of
the
whole
show
too
excited
to
speak
sidney
knelt
breathless
at
the
sill
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
the
cause
of
the
excitement
must
appear
she
was
perhaps
the
only
one
of
all
the
watchers
who
did
not
applaud
as
the
eight
powerful
oxen
came
slowly
down
the
sunshiny
street
guided
by
the
tall
lean
driver
who
walked
beside
them
and
dragging
the
great
wagon
and
its
freight
of
rapturous
children
only
an
old
after
all
only
a
team
of
shabby
oxen
such
as
a
thousand
in
california
might
supply
only
a
score
or
more
of
the
untrained
children
of
the
very
poor
but
what
an
enchantment
of
love
and
hope
and
had
been
flung
over
them
all
the
body
of
the
wagon
was
entirely
hidden
by
exquisite
hydrangeas
the
wheels
were
moving
disks
of
the
pale
pink
and
blue
blossoms
the
oxen
their
horns
gilded
their
polished
hoofs
twinkling
as
they
moved
wore
yokes
that
seemed
solidly
made
of
the
flowers
and
great
ropes
of
blossoms
hid
the
swinging
chains
over
each
animal
a
brilliant
cover
had
been
flung
and
at
the
head
of
each
a
young
indian
boy
magnificent
in
wampum
and
fringed
leather
feathers
and
beads
walked
sedately
the
children
were
grouped
on
the
wagon
in
a
nest
of
hydrangea
blooms
the
pink
and
cream
and
blue
of
their
gowns
blending
with
the
flowers
all
about
them
the
sunlight
shining
full
in
their
happy
eyes
over
their
shoulders
were
garlands
of
poppies
roses
daisies
carnations
lilies
or
other
blossoms
their
hands
were
full
of
flowers
but
it
was
the
radiance
of
their
faces
that
shone
brightest
after
all
it
was
the
little
consumptive
ecstatic
smile
as
she
sat
resting
against
an
invisible
support
it
was
the
joy
in
mary
scott
thin
eager
face
framed
now
in
her
loosened
dark
hair
and
with
the
shadow
like
her
crutch
laid
aside
for
a
while
that
somehow
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
that
watched
santa
paloma
cheered
and
applauded
these
forgotten
children
of
hers
and
the
children
laughed
and
waved
their
hands
in
return
youth
and
happiness
and
incarnate
the
vision
went
on
its
way
down
the
bright
street
and
other
carriages
followed
it
and
were
praised
as
those
that
had
gone
before
had
been
but
no
entry
in
any
flower
parade
that
santa
paloma
had
ever
known
was
as
much
discussed
as
this
one
indeed
it
began
a
new
era
but
that
was
later
on
when
burgoyne
plain
white
frock
appeared
among
the
elaborate
gowns
worn
at
the
club
luncheon
that
afternoon
she
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
congratulations
she
went
away
very
early
to
superintend
the
children
luncheon
at
the
hall
and
then
white
had
a
chance
to
tell
the
distinguished
guests
who
she
was
and
that
she
could
well
afford
to
play
lady
bountiful
to
the
santa
paloma
children
one
would
imagine
it
she
seems
absolutely
simple
and
unspoiled
said
mrs
governor
she
is
said
lloyd
unexpectedly
i
told
her
how
scared
most
of
us
had
been
at
the
mere
idea
of
her
coming
here
parker
lloyd
told
her
husband
later
and
how
friendly
she
is
and
that
she
always
wears
little
wash
dresses
and
that
the
other
girls
are
beginning
to
wear
checked
aprons
and
things
because
her
girls
do
of
course
i
said
it
sort
of
laughingly
you
know
but
i
do
think
clara
white
liked
it
one
bit
and
i
do
care
clara
is
rather
mad
at
me
anyway
she
went
on
musingly
because
yesterday
she
telephoned
that
she
was
going
to
send
that
armenian
peddler
over
here
with
some
madeira
lunch
cloths
they
were
beauties
and
only
dollars
you
pay
fifty
for
them
at
raphael
weil
they
smuggled
i
suppose
but
i
simply
said
i
afford
it
and
let
it
go
at
that
she
laughed
quite
cattily
parker
and
said
that
rather
funny
but
i
do
care
whether
clara
white
thinks
i
copying
burgoyne
or
not
i
might
as
well
copy
her
as
somebody
else
burgoyne
and
barry
valentine
went
on
the
evening
of
the
great
day
to
see
the
fireworks
and
the
crowds
and
to
hear
the
announcements
of
santa
paloma
was
in
holiday
mood
and
the
two
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
hour
like
irresponsible
children
it
was
a
warm
wonderful
summer
night
the
sky
was
close
and
thickly
spangled
with
stars
main
street
bobbed
with
japanese
lanterns
rang
with
happy
voices
and
laughter
the
jostling
pushing
currents
of
men
in
summer
suits
and
joyous
girls
in
thin
gowns
were
all
sidney
found
friends
on
all
sides
and
laughed
and
called
her
greetings
as
gaily
as
anyone
barry
had
a
rare
opportunity
to
watch
her
unobserved
as
she
went
her
happy
way
the
earnest
happy
brightness
in
her
eyes
when
some
shabby
little
woman
from
old
paloma
laid
a
timid
hand
on
her
arm
her
adoring
interest
in
the
fat
babies
that
slumbered
heavily
on
paternal
shoulders
her
ready
use
of
names
is
this
fun
agnes
you
have
lost
harry
have
you
mrs
do
you
and
your
friend
want
to
come
and
have
some
with
us
josie
but
we
must
waste
too
much
time
here
barry
she
would
say
now
and
then
for
at
eight
a
grand
concert
program
and
distribution
of
prizes
was
scheduled
to
take
place
at
the
town
hall
and
sidney
was
anxious
not
to
miss
an
instant
of
it
do
worry
i
get
you
there
barry
would
answer
reassuringly
amused
at
her
eagerness
and
true
to
his
word
he
stopped
her
at
the
wide
doorway
of
the
concert
hall
fully
five
minutes
before
the
hour
and
they
found
themselves
joining
the
slow
stream
of
men
and
women
and
children
that
was
pouring
up
the
wide
dingy
stairway
everyone
was
trying
in
all
good
humor
to
press
ahead
of
everyone
else
inspired
with
the
sudden
agonizing
conviction
that
in
the
next
two
minutes
every
desirable
seat
would
certainly
be
gone
even
sidney
familiar
as
she
was
with
every
grand
opera
house
in
the
world
felt
the
infection
and
asked
rather
nervously
if
any
of
the
seats
were
reserved
do
worry
we
get
seats
said
the
imperturbable
barry
and
several
children
in
their
neighborhood
laughed
out
in
sudden
exquisite
relief
seats
indeed
there
were
although
the
front
rows
were
filling
fast
and
all
the
were
taken
by
squirming
restless
small
children
burgoyne
sat
down
and
studied
the
hall
with
delighted
eyes
it
was
ordinarily
only
a
shabby
enormous
room
filled
with
rows
of
chairs
and
with
an
elevated
stage
at
the
far
end
but
like
all
santa
paloma
it
was
in
holiday
trim
all
the
windows
wide
open
to
the
summer
darkness
were
framed
in
bunting
and
drooping
flowers
and
on
the
stage
were
potted
palms
and
crossed
flags
great
masses
of
bamboo
and
california
ferns
were
tied
with
red
white
and
blue
streamers
between
the
windows
and
beside
these
decorations
which
were
new
for
the
occasion
were
purple
and
yellow
banners
left
from
the
night
of
the
native
sons
grand
ball
and
reception
a
month
ago
and
arched
above
the
stage
the
single
word
welcome
in
letters
two
feet
high
which
dated
back
to
the
ladies
of
saint
rose
parish
annual
fair
and
entertainment
in
may
if
the
combined
effect
of
these
was
not
wholly
artistic
at
least
it
was
very
gay
and
the
murmur
of
voices
and
laughter
all
over
the
hall
was
gay
too
and
gay
almost
to
intoxication
it
was
to
hear
the
musicians
tentatively
and
subduedly
trying
their
instruments
up
by
the
piano
with
their
sleek
heads
close
together
presently
every
chair
in
the
house
had
its
occupant
and
the
younger
element
began
a
spasmodic
sort
of
clapping
as
a
delicate
hint
to
the
agitated
managers
who
were
behind
the
scenes
running
blindly
about
with
worn
scraps
of
scribbled
paper
in
their
hands
desperately
attempting
to
call
the
roll
of
their
performers
when
joe
the
janitor
came
out
onto
the
stage
he
was
royally
applauded
although
he
did
no
more
than
move
a
tin
stand
on
which
there
were
numbered
cards
from
one
side
of
the
stage
to
the
other
and
change
the
number
in
view
from
to
fathers
and
mothers
perspiring
clean
and
smiled
upon
youthful
impatience
and
impertinence
as
they
sat
fanning
and
discussing
the
newcomers
or
leaned
forward
or
backward
for
hilarious
scraps
of
conversation
with
their
neighbors
lovers
as
always
oblivious
of
time
sat
entirely
indifferent
to
the
rise
or
fall
of
the
curtain
the
girls
with
demurely
dropped
lashes
the
men
deep
in
low
monotones
their
faces
close
to
the
lovely
faces
so
near
their
arms
flung
in
all
across
the
backs
of
the
chairs
and
any
motherly
heart
might
have
been
stirred
with
an
aching
sort
of
tenderness
as
sidney
burgoyne
was
at
the
sight
of
so
much
awkward
budding
manliness
so
many
shining
pompadours
and
carefully
polished
shoes
and
outrageous
cravats
so
many
silky
filleted
little
heads
and
innocent
young
bosoms
by
all
sorts
of
dainty
little
conspiracies
of
lace
and
lawn
youth
enchanting
important
had
coolly
taken
possession
of
the
hall
as
it
does
of
everything
for
its
own
happy
plans
and
something
of
the
gossamer
beauty
of
it
seemed
to
be
clouding
older
and
wiser
eyes
sidney
found
her
eyes
resting
upon
barry
big
shapely
hand
as
he
leaned
forward
deep
in
conversation
with
brown
in
the
chair
ahead
and
she
was
conscious
that
she
wanted
to
sit
back
and
shut
her
eyes
and
draw
a
deep
breath
of
sheer
irrational
happiness
because
this
was
barry
next
to
her
and
that
he
liked
to
be
there
presently
the
hall
thrilled
to
see
two
and
obviously
embarrassed
men
come
out
to
seat
themselves
in
the
of
chairs
that
lined
the
stage
and
a
moment
later
applause
broke
out
for
the
mayor
and
his
wife
and
the
members
of
the
flower
parade
committee
of
arrangements
and
for
the
nondescript
persons
who
invariably
fill
in
such
a
group
and
for
the
kindly
smiling
governor
and
the
ladies
of
his
party
and
for
the
willard
whites
who
with
the
easiest
manners
in
the
world
were
in
actual
conversation
with
the
great
people
as
they
came
upon
the
stage
at
the
sight
of
them
carew
still
vigorously
clapping
leaned
over
to
say
to
burgoyne
look
at
clara
white
and
we
were
wondering
why
they
did
come
in
would
she
make
you
tired
you
might
kiss
her
hand
when
you
go
up
to
get
your
prize
burgoyne
suggested
barry
and
a
general
giggle
went
the
rounds
if
i
get
a
prize
said
sidney
in
alarm
you
got
to
go
up
i
could
we
see
barry
began
his
voice
drowned
by
the
opening
crash
of
the
band
there
followed
what
the
three
papers
of
santa
paloma
were
unanimous
the
next
day
in
describing
as
the
most
brilliant
and
enjoyable
concert
ever
given
in
santa
paloma
it
was
received
with
immense
enthusiasm
entirely
unaffected
by
the
fact
that
everyone
present
had
heard
miss
emelie
jeanne
foster
sing
twickenham
ferry
before
with
dawn
as
an
encore
and
was
familiar
also
with
the
selections
of
the
stringed
instrument
club
and
had
listened
to
young
doctor
perry
impassioned
tenor
many
times
as
for
george
with
his
irresistible
laughing
song
and
the
song
about
the
train
that
went
to
morro
he
was
more
popular
every
time
he
appeared
and
was
greeted
now
by
mad
applause
and
shouts
of
there
george
and
hello
george
and
the
home
boys
quartette
from
emville
was
quite
new
and
various
solo
singers
and
a
lady
elocutionist
from
san
francisco
were
heard
for
the
first
time
the
latter
who
was
on
the
program
merely
for
a
recitation
selected
was
so
successful
with
pauline
pavlovna
and
seein
things
at
night
that
it
was
nearly
ten
before
the
governor
was
introduced
however
he
was
at
last
duly
presented
to
the
applauding
hundreds
and
came
forward
to
the
footlights
to
address
them
and
made
everyone
laugh
and
feel
friendly
by
saying
immediately
that
he
knew
they
had
come
out
that
evening
to
hear
an
old
man
make
a
long
speech
he
said
he
did
believe
in
speechmaking
much
he
believed
in
doing
things
there
were
always
a
lot
of
people
to
stand
around
and
make
speeches
like
himself
and
there
was
more
laughter
he
said
that
he
knew
the
business
of
the
evening
was
the
giving
out
of
these
prizes
here
he
did
know
what
was
in
these
boxes
he
indicated
the
daintily
wrapped
and
tied
packages
that
stood
on
the
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
but
he
thought
every
lady
in
the
hall
would
know
before
she
went
home
and
perhaps
some
one
of
them
would
tell
him
and
there
was
more
laughter
he
said
he
hoped
that
there
was
something
mighty
nice
in
the
largest
box
because
he
understood
that
it
was
to
go
to
a
he
did
know
whether
the
good
people
in
the
hall
believed
in
fairies
or
not
but
he
knew
that
some
of
the
children
in
old
paloma
did
and
he
had
seen
and
heard
enough
that
day
to
make
him
believe
in
too
he
heard
of
a
fairy
years
ago
who
made
a
out
of
a
pumpkin
but
he
did
think
that
was
any
harder
than
to
make
a
out
of
a
and
put
twenty
cinderellas
into
it
instead
of
one
he
said
it
gave
him
great
pride
and
pleasure
to
announce
that
the
first
prize
for
beautiful
contest
had
been
unanimously
awarded
to
sidney
burgoyne
watching
him
with
fascinated
eyes
her
breath
coming
fast
and
unevenly
her
color
brightening
and
fading
heard
only
so
much
and
then
with
a
desperate
impulse
to
get
away
half
rose
to
her
feet
but
she
was
too
late
long
before
the
governor
reached
her
name
a
sudden
outburst
of
laughter
and
clapping
shook
the
hall
there
was
a
friendly
stir
and
murmur
about
her
a
hundred
voices
came
to
her
ears
it
burgoyne
of
course
she
got
it
she
got
the
first
prize
go
on
up
burgoyne

it

that
great
she
got
it
go
up
and
get
it
you
got
first
prize
i
guess
you
have
to
go
up
for
it
barry
urged
her
he
did
say
so
sidney
protested
nervously
but
she
let
herself
be
into
the
aisle
and
somehow
reached
the
three
little
steps
that
led
up
to
the
platform
and
found
herself
facing
his
excellency
in
an
uproar
of
applause
the
governor
said
a
few
smiling
words
as
he
put
a
large
box
into
her
hands
sidney
knew
this
because
she
saw
his
lips
move
but
the
house
had
gone
quite
mad
by
this
time
and
not
a
word
was
audible
everyone
in
the
hall
knew
that
a
tall
was
in
the
box
for
it
had
been
on
exhibition
in
the
window
of
postag
jewelry
store
for
three
weeks
it
was
of
silver
and
lined
with
gold
both
metals
shining
with
an
unearthly
and
flawless
radiance
and
there
was
awarded
as
a
first
prize
in
the
twelfth
floral
parade
of
santa
paloma
california
cut
beautifully
into
one
side
and
a
scroll
all
ready
on
the
other
side
to
be
engraved
with
the
lucky
winner
name
she
had
been
joking
for
two
or
three
weeks
about
the
possibility
of
this
very
occurrence
had
been
it
all
day
but
now
suddenly
all
the
joke
seemed
gone
out
of
it
and
she
was
only
curiously
stirred
and
shaken
she
looked
confusedly
down
at
the
sea
of
faces
below
her
smiles
were
everywhere
the
eyes
that
were
upon
her
were
full
of
all
affection
and
pride
she
had
done
so
little
after
all
she
said
to
herself
with
sudden
humility
almost
with
shame
and
it
was
so
poignantly
sweet
to
realize
that
they
loved
her
that
she
was
one
of
themselves
they
were
glad
she
had
won
she
who
had
been
a
stranger
to
all
of
them
only
a
few
months
ago
her
eyes
full
of
sudden
tears
her
lip
shaking
she
could
only
bow
and
bow
again
and
then
just
as
her
smile
threatened
to
become
entirely
eclipsed
she
managed
a
husky
thank
you
all
so
much
and
descended
the
steps
rapidly
to
slip
into
her
chair
between
barry
and
george
carew
you
know
you
ought
to
make
a
long
tedious
speech
like
that
on
an
occasion
like
this
sid
barry
said
when
she
had
somewhat
recovered
her
equilibrium
and
the
silver
loving
cup
was
unwrapped
and
was
being
passed
admiringly
from
hand
to
hand
do
she
said
warningly
or
you
have
me
weeping
on
your
shoulder
instead
of
which
she
was
her
gayest
self
and
accepted
endless
congratulations
with
joyous
composure
as
the
audience
streamed
out
into
the
reviving
festivity
of
main
street
the
tide
was
turning
in
one
direction
now
for
there
were
to
be
fireworks
and
a
stupendous
band
concert
immediately
following
the
concert
in
a
vacant
lot
not
far
away
and
presently
they
all
found
themselves
seated
on
the
fragrant
grass
under
the
stars
george
carew
at
sidney
feet
solemnly
wrapped
sections
of
molasses
popcorn
in
oiled
paper
and
passed
them
to
the
ladies
barry
coat
made
a
comfortable
seat
for
burgoyne
and
little
brown
barry
himself
was
just
behind
and
carew
and
her
big
son
beside
them
all
about
in
the
darkness
were
other
groups
mothers
and
fathers
and
alert
chattering
children
alice
carter
the
big
radiant
now
and
with
a
hoarse
inarticulate
adoring
young
plumber
in
tow
went
by
them
and
stooped
to
whisper
something
to
burgoyne
i
wish
you
would
come
alice
the
lady
answered
eagerly
as
they
went
on
then
the
rockets
began
to
hiss
up
toward
the
stars
each
falling
shower
of
light
greeted
with
a
long
rapturous
sputtered
nearer
the
ground
red
lights
made
eerie
great
spots
of
illumination
here
and
there
against
which
dark
little
figures
moved
i
do
know
that
i
ever
had
a
happier
day
in
my
life
said
sidney
burgoyne
chapter
xiv
more
happy
days
followed
for
santa
paloma
after
the
fourth
of
july
felt
only
friendliness
for
the
new
owner
of
the
hall
and
burgoyne
informal
teas
on
the
river
bank
began
to
prove
a
powerful
attraction
even
rivaling
the
club
in
feminine
favor
sometimes
the
hostess
enlisted
all
their
sympathies
for
a
newly
arrived
old
paloma
baby
and
they
tore
lengths
of
flannel
and
busily
stitched
at
tiny
garments
under
the
shade
of
the
willow
and
pepper
trees
sometimes
she
had
in
her
care
one
or
more
older
babies
whose
busy
mother
was
taking
a
day
rest
or
whose
father
was
perhaps
ill
needing
all
the
care
always
there
was
something
to
read
and
discuss
an
editorial
in
some
eastern
magazine
that
made
them
all
indignant
or
enthusiastic
or
a
short
story
worth
reading
aloud
and
almost
always
the
children
were
within
call
digging
great
holes
in
the
pebbly
shallows
of
the
river
only
to
fill
them
up
again
toiling
over
bridges
and
dams
climbing
out
to
the
perilous
length
of
the
branches
that
hung
above
the
water
little
mary
scott
released
from
the
fear
of
an
and
facing
all
unconsciously
a
far
longer
journey
than
the
dreaded
one
to
a
san
francisco
hospital
had
her
own
cushioned
chair
near
the
bank
where
she
could
hear
and
see
and
laugh
at
everything
that
went
on
and
revel
in
consolation
and
bandages
when
the
inevitable
accidents
made
them
necessary
mary
had
no
cares
now
no
responsibility
more
serious
than
to
be
sure
her
feet
did
get
cold
and
to
tell
burgoyne
the
minute
her
head
ached
there
was
to
be
nothing
but
rest
and
comfort
and
laughter
for
her
in
life
now
i
do
know
why
we
should
pity
her
little
brown
said
thoughtfully
one
day
as
they
watched
her
with
the
other
children
we
ca
ever
hope
to
feel
that
any
of
our
children
are
as
safe
as
she
is
burgoyne
method
of
entertaining
the
children
was
simple
she
always
made
them
work
as
hard
as
possible
one
day
they
begged
her
to
let
them
build
a
truly
dam
that
would
really
stop
the
lobos
in
its
placid
course
she
consulted
gravely
with
george
carew
should
they
attempt
it
george
after
serious
consideration
thought
they
should
as
a
result
twenty
children
panted
and
toiled
through
a
warm
saturday
afternoon
george
and
the
adams
boys
shouting
directions
as
they
handled
planks
and
stones
everybody
wet
happy
and
excited
not
the
least
glorious
moment
was
when
the
dam
was
broken
at
five
just
before
refreshments
were
served
we
do
that
better
next
saturday
said
george
but
a
week
later
they
wanted
to
clean
the
barn
and
organize
a
club
burgoyne
was
sure
they
could
all
that
space
she
said
and
those
bins
and
the
little
rooms
and
all
very
well
then
they
could
try
later
they
longed
for
a
picnic
supper
in
the
woods
with
an
open
fire
and
potatoes
and
singing
their
hostess
was
dubious
entreated
them
to
consider
the
work
involved
dragging
stones
for
the
fire
and
carrying
potatoes
and
bacon
and
jam
and
all
the
rest
of
it
up
there
this
was
at
two
and
at
six
she
was
formally
asked
to
come
up
and
inspect
the
cleared
camping
ground
and
the
fireplace
with
its
broilers
and
the
mammoth
stack
of
fuel
prepared
i
knew
you
do
it
said
the
lady
delightedly
now
we
really
have
a
fine
supper
and
a
memorable
supper
they
had
and
indian
stories
and
singing
and
they
went
home
well
after
dusk
to
end
the
day
perfectly
they
like
this
sort
of
thing
much
better
than
white
dresses
and
a
professional
entertainer
and
dancing
and
too
much
said
burgoyne
to
adams
of
course
they
do
said
adams
who
had
her
own
reasons
for
turning
rather
red
and
speaking
somewhat
faintly
and
it
much
less
work
and
much
less
expense
she
added
now
it
is
when
they
can
be
said
burgoyne
but
in
winter
they
do
make
awful
work
indoors
however
there
is
tramping
for
dry
weather
and
i
mean
to
have
a
stove
set
up
in
the
old
and
turn
them
all
loose
in
there
when
it
wet
theatricals
and
pasting
things
and
singing
and
now
and
then
is
all
fun
and
one
knows
that
they
safe
and
piling
up
happy
memories
of
their
home
you
make
a
sort
of
profession
of
motherhood
said
white
dryly
it
is
my
profession
said
the
hostess
with
her
happy
laugh
but
her
happiness
had
a
sudden
check
in
sidney
found
herself
no
more
immune
from
heartache
than
any
other
woman
no
more
philosophical
over
a
hurt
it
was
she
told
herself
only
a
trifle
after
all
she
was
absurd
to
let
it
cloud
the
bright
day
for
her
and
keep
her
restless
and
wakeful
at
night
it
was
nothing
only
only
it
was
the
first
time
that
barry
had
failed
her
he
was
gone
gone
without
a
word
of
explanation
to
anyone
leaving
his
work
at
the
mail
unfinished
leaving
even
billy
his
usual
confidant
quite
in
the
dark
sidney
had
noticed
for
days
a
certain
moodiness
and
unresponsiveness
about
him
had
tried
rather
timidly
to
win
him
from
it
had
got
up
uneasily
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
night
just
past
to
look
across
the
garden
to
his
house
and
wonder
why
barry
light
burned
on
and
on
she
had
meant
to
send
for
him
in
the
morning
but
billy
artlessly
appearing
when
the
waffles
came
on
at
breakfast
remarked
that
dad
was
gone
to
san
francisco
to
the
city
billy
sidney
asked
did
he
say
why
he
did
even
say
goodbye
billy
replied
cheerfully
he
just
left
a
note
for
hayashi
it
said
he
did
know
how
long
he
would
be
gone
sidney
tried
with
small
success
to
deceive
herself
into
thinking
that
it
was
the
mere
mysteriousness
of
this
that
cut
her
she
presently
went
down
to
see
carew
and
was
fretted
because
that
lady
would
for
some
time
discuss
nothing
but
the
successful
treatment
of
insects
on
the
barry
seems
to
have
disappeared
said
sidney
finally
in
a
casual
tone
carew
straightened
up
forgot
hellebore
and
tobacco
juice
for
the
moment
did
i
tell
you
what
silva
told
me
she
asked
silva
echoed
sidney
at
a
loss
the
milkman
he
told
me
that
when
he
came
up
at
five
this
morning
barry
came
out
of
the
gate
and
that
he
looked
awfully
he
said
he
was
pale
and
that
his
eyes
looked
badly
and
that
he
hardly
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
doing
and
oh
my
dear
i
afraid
that
drinking
again
i
sure
of
it
it
two
years
now
since
he
has
done
this
i
think
it
too
bad
but
you
know
he
used
to
go
down
to
town
every
little
while
for
a
regular
time
with
those
newspaper
men
he
does
like
santa
paloma
you
know
he
gets
very
bored
here
he
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
sidney
did
not
answer
because
she
could
not
resentment
and
loyalty
shame
and
heartache
kept
her
lips
dumb
she
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
alone
in
the
sweet
early
darkness
for
an
hour
then
she
went
indoors
and
tried
to
amuse
herself
at
the
piano
suddenly
her
face
twisted
she
laid
her
arm
along
the
rack
and
her
face
on
her
arm
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
then
she
straightened
up
resolutely
piled
the
music
closed
the
piano
and
went
upstairs
but
perhaps
i
not
old
enough
yet
for
an
olive
garden
she
told
the
stars
from
her
window
an
hour
later
chapter
xv
another
day
went
by
and
still
there
was
no
news
from
barry
the
early
autumn
weather
was
exquisite
and
sidney
with
the
additional
work
for
the
mail
that
the
editor
absence
left
for
her
found
herself
very
busy
but
life
seemed
suddenly
to
taste
flat
and
uninteresting
to
her
the
sunlight
was
glaring
the
afternoons
dusty
and
windy
and
under
all
the
day
duties
and
pleasures
the
meeting
of
neighbors
the
children
confidences
her
busy
coming
and
going
up
and
down
the
village
streets
ran
a
sick
undercurrent
of
disappointment
and
heartache
she
went
to
the
twice
in
that
first
long
day
for
the
arriving
mail
and
miss
potter
pleased
at
these
glimpses
of
the
lady
from
the
hall
chatted
blithely
as
she
pushed
italian
letters
london
letters
letters
from
washington
and
new
york
through
the
little
wicket
but
there
was
not
a
line
from
barry
on
the
second
day
sidney
began
to
think
of
sending
him
a
note
it
might
be
chanced
to
the
bohemian
club
but
no
she
would
do
that
if
he
did
not
care
enough
to
write
her
she
certainly
would
write
him
she
began
to
realize
how
different
santa
paloma
was
without
his
big
figure
his
laughter
his
joyous
comment
upon
people
and
things
she
had
taken
his
comradeship
for
granted
taken
it
as
just
one
more
element
of
the
old
childish
days
regained
never
thought
of
its
rude
interruption
or
ending
now
she
felt
ashamed
and
sore
she
had
been
playing
with
fire
she
told
herself
severely
she
had
perhaps
hurt
him
she
had
certainly
given
herself
needless
heartache
no
romantic
girl
of
seventeen
ever
suffered
a
more
unreasoning
pang
than
did
sidney
when
she
came
upon
shabby
office
coat
hanging
behind
his
desk
or
found
in
her
own
desk
one
of
the
careless
notes
he
so
frequently
used
to
leave
there
at
night
for
her
to
find
in
the
morning
however
in
the
curious
way
that
things
utterly
unrelated
sometimes
play
upon
each
other
in
this
life
these
days
of
bewilderment
and
chagrin
bore
certain
good
fruit
sidney
had
for
some
weeks
been
planning
an
attack
upon
the
sympathies
of
the
santa
paloma
club
but
had
shrunk
from
beginning
it
because
life
was
running
very
smoothly
and
happily
and
she
was
growing
too
genuinely
fond
of
her
new
neighbors
to
risk
jeopardizing
their
affection
for
her
by
a
move
she
suspected
would
be
unpopular
but
now
she
was
unhappy
and
with
the
curious
stoicism
that
is
born
of
unhappiness
she
plunged
straight
into
the
matter
on
the
third
day
after
barry
disappearance
she
appeared
at
the
regular
meeting
of
the
club
as
carew
guest
i
hope
this
means
that
you
are
coming
to
your
senses
ye
bad
girl
said
apostleman
drawing
her
to
the
next
chair
with
a
fat
imperative
hand
perhaps
it
does
sidney
answered
with
a
rather
nervous
smile
she
sat
attentive
and
appreciative
through
the
reading
of
a
paper
entitled
some
glimpses
of
the
real
burns
and
seemed
immensely
to
enjoy
the
four
songs
burns
poems
set
to
music
and
the
clever
recitation
of
several
selections
from
burns
that
followed
then
the
chairman
announced
that
burgoyne
whom
i
sure
we
all
know
although
she
is
one
of
us
yet
laughter
has
asked
permission
to
address
the
club
at
the
conclusion
of
the
regular
program
there
was
a
little
applause
and
sidney
very
rosy
walked
rapidly
forward
to
stand
just
below
the
platform
she
was
nervous
obviously
and
spoke
hurriedly
and
in
a
rather
unnatural
voice
your
chairman
and
president
she
began
with
a
little
inclination
toward
each
have
given
me
permission
to
speak
to
you
today
for
five
minutes
because
i
want
to
ask
the
santa
paloma
women
club
a
favor
a
great
favor
in
fact
i
wo
say
how
much
i
hope
the
club
will
decide
to
grant
it
but
just
tell
you
what
it
is
it
has
to
do
with
the
factory
girls
across
the
river
i
become
interested
in
some
of
them
partly
i
suppose
because
some
friends
of
mine
are
working
for
just
such
girls
only
under
infinitely
harder
circumstances
in
some
of
the
eastern
cities
i
feel
we
all
feel
i
know
that
the
atmosphere
of
old
paloma
is
a
dangerous
one
for
girls
every
year
certain
ones
among
them
wrong
as
the
expression
is
and
when
a
girl
once
does
that
she
is
apt
to
go
very
wrong
indeed
before
she
stops
she
does
care
what
she
does
in
fact
and
her
own
people
only
make
it
harder
practically
drive
her
away
or
even
if
she
marries
decently
and
tries
to
live
down
all
the
past
it
comes
up
between
her
and
her
neighbors
between
her
and
her
children
perhaps
and
embitters
her
whole
life
and
so
finally
she
goes
to
join
that
terrible
army
of
women
that
we
others
try
to
pretend
we
never
see
or
hear
of
at
all
these
girls
work
hard
all
day
and
their
homes
are
the
right
sort
of
homes
with
hot
dirty
rooms
full
of
quarreling
and
crowding
and
so
they
slip
out
at
night
and
meet
their
friends
in
the
dancehalls
and
the
shows
and
we
we
ca
blame
them
her
voice
had
grown
less
diffident
and
rang
with
sudden
longing
and
appeal
they
want
only
what
we
all
wanted
a
few
years
ago
she
said
they
want
good
times
lights
and
music
and
pretty
gowns
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
long
hot
afternoons
dances
theatricals
harmless
meetings
of
all
sorts
if
we
could
give
them
safe
clean
fun
not
patronizingly
and
not
too
obviously
instructive
they
be
willing
to
wait
for
it
they
talk
about
it
instead
of
more
dangerous
things
they
give
up
dangerous
things
for
it
they
are
very
nice
girls
some
of
them
and
their
friends
are
very
nice
fellows
for
the
most
part
and
they
are
they
are
so
very
young
however
about
the
club
i
am
wondering
if
it
could
be
borrowed
for
a
temporary
for
them
if
we
form
a
sort
of
club
among
them
i
say
temporary
because
i
hope
we
will
build
them
a
clubhouse
of
their
own
some
day
but
meantime
there
is
only
the
grand
opera
house
which
all
the
traveling
theatrical
companies
rent
hansen
hall
which
is
over
a
saloon
so
that
wo
do
and
the
concert
hall
which
costs
dollars
a
night
we
would
of
course
see
that
the
club
was
cleaned
after
every
meeting
and
pay
for
the
lights
i
i
think
about
all
finished
sidney
feeling
that
she
had
put
her
case
rather
ineloquently
and
coming
to
a
full
stop
she
sat
down
her
eyes
nowhere
her
cheeks
very
red
there
was
the
silence
of
utter
surprise
in
the
room
after
a
pause
white
raised
a
gloved
hand
permission
from
the
chair
was
given
white
to
speak
your
idea
would
be
to
give
the
old
paloma
girls
a
dance
here
mrs
burgoyne
regular
dances
yes
said
sidney
standing
up
to
let
them
use
the
clubhouse
say
two
nights
a
week
reading
and
singing
and
sewing
one
night
perhaps
and
a
dance
another
or
we
could
get
good
films
or
have
a
concert
or
play
and
ask
the
mothers
and
fathers
now
and
then
charades
and
morris
dances
something
like
that
dancing
and
oh
dear
dear
said
white
with
a
whimsical
smile
and
a
shake
of
her
head
and
there
was
laughter
all
those
things
take
costuming
and
that
takes
money
said
the
chairman
after
a
silence
rather
hesitatingly
money
is
the
problem
burgoyne
rejoined
eagerly
you
find
that
they
spend
a
good
deal
now
even
for
the
wretched
pleasures
they
have
there
was
another
silence
then
white
again
gained
permission
to
speak
and
rose
to
do
so
i
think
perhaps
burgoyne
being
a
newcomer
here
does
quite
understand
our
feeling
toward
our
little
club
she
said
very
pleasantly
we
built
it
she
went
on
with
a
slight
touch
of
emotion
as
a
little
refuge
from
everything
jarring
and
unpleasant
we
meant
it
to
stand
for
something
a
little
better
and
finer
than
the
things
of
everyday
life
can
possibly
be
perhaps
we
felt
that
there
are
already
too
many
dances
and
too
many
shows
in
the
world
perhaps
we
felt
that
if
we
could
forget
those
things
for
a
little
while
i
do
mean
said
white
smilingly
reasonable
that
the
reform
of
wayward
girls
is
a
splendid
and
ennobling
thing
i
believe
heartily
in
the
work
institutions
and
schools
are
doing
along
those
lines
but
and
with
a
pretty
little
gesture
of
helplessness
she
flung
out
her
hands
but
we
ca
have
a
hull
house
in
every
little
town
you
know
and
i
afraid
we
should
find
very
many
jane
addamses
if
we
did
good
girls
do
need
this
sort
of
thing
and
bad
girls
well
unfortunately
the
world
has
always
had
bad
girls
and
always
will
have
we
would
merely
turn
our
lovely
clubhouse
over
to
a
lot
of
little
romping
hoydens
but
began
burgoyne
eagerly
just
one
moment
said
the
president
sweetly
and
burgoyne
sat
down
with
blazing
cheeks
i
only
want
to
say
that
i
think
this
is
outside
the
purpose
for
which
the
club
was
formed
added
white
if
the
club
would
care
to
vote
on
this
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
the
wisest
way
of
settling
the
matter
but
perhaps
we
could
hear
from
a
few
more
members
first
there
was
a
little
rustle
of
applause
at
this
and
sidney
felt
her
heart
give
a
sick
plunge
and
raged
within
herself
because
her
own
act
had
placed
her
at
so
great
a
disadvantage
in
another
moment
however
general
attention
was
directed
to
a
tall
plainly
dressed
gentle
woman
who
rose
and
said
rather
shyly
since
you
suggested
our
discussing
this
a
little
president
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
like
this
idea
very
much
myself
i
often
felt
that
we
were
doing
very
much
good
just
uplifting
ourselves
as
it
were
and
i
hope
burgoyne
will
let
me
help
her
in
any
way
i
can
whether
the
club
votes
for
or
against
this
plan
i
i
have
four
girls
and
boys
of
my
own
at
home
as
you
know
and
i
find
that
even
with
plenty
of
music
and
all
the
library
books
and
company
they
want
it
hard
enough
to
keep
those
children
happy
at
night
and
ladies
there
must
be
plenty
of
mothers
over
there
in
old
paloma
who
worry
about
it
as
we
do
and
yet
have
no
way
of
helping
themselves
it
seems
to
me
we
could
put
our
clubhouse
to
better
use
or
our
time
either
for
that
matter
i
would
vote
decidedly
to
such
a
plan
often
felt
that
we
well
that
we
rather
wasted
some
of
our
time
here
she
ended
mildly
thank
you
moore
said
white
politely
i
hope
it
is
part
of
your
idea
to
let
our
own
children
have
a
part
in
the
entertainments
you
propose
briskly
added
another
woman
a
clergyman
wife
rising
immediately
i
think
doctor
babcock
would
thoroughly
approve
of
the
plan
and
i
am
sure
i
do
every
little
while
she
went
on
smilingly
my
husband
asks
me
what
good
the
club
is
doing
and
i
never
can
answer
men
clubs
do
so
much
good
said
some
loud
cheerful
voice
at
the
back
of
the
hall
and
there
was
laughter
a
great
many
of
them
do
good
and
have
side
issues
like
this
one
that
are
all
for
good
the
clergyman
wife
responded
quickly
and
personally
i
would
thank
god
to
be
able
to
save
even
ten
to
save
even
one
of
those
old
paloma
girls
from
a
life
of
shame
and
suffering
i
wish
we
had
begun
before
burgoyne
may
propose
to
build
them
their
own
clubhouse
entirely
herself
but
if
not
i
hope
we
can
all
help
in
that
too
when
the
time
comes
thank
you
babcock
said
the
president
coldly
what
do
you
think
miss
pratt
oh
carew
and
brown
and
i
all
feel
as
burgoyne
does
admitted
anne
pratt
innocently
a
little
fluttered
it
was
white
turn
to
color
i
did
know
that
the
matter
had
been
discussed
she
said
stiffly
only
generally
not
in
reference
to
the
club
burgoyne
supplied
quickly
i
myself
will
propose
an
affirmative
vote
said
rich
old
voice
apostleman
was
entirely
indifferent
to
parliamentary
law
and
was
never
in
order
how
d
do
it
the
ayes
rise
is
that
it
she
pulled
herself
magnificently
erect
by
the
in
front
of
her
and
with
clapping
and
laughter
the
entire
club
rose
to
its
feet
this
is
entirely
out
of
order
said
white
very
rosy
everyone
sat
down
suddenly
and
the
chairman
gave
two
emphatic
raps
of
her
gavel
the
president
then
asked
permission
to
speak
and
moved
with
great
dignity
that
the
matter
be
laid
before
the
board
of
directors
at
the
next
meeting
and
if
approved
submitted
in
due
order
to
the
vote
of
the
club
the
motion
was
briskly
seconded
and
a
few
minutes
later
sidney
found
herself
freed
from
the
babel
of
voices
and
walking
home
with
nervous
rapidity
well
that
over
she
said
once
or
twice
aloud
thank
heaven
it
over
is
your
head
better
mother
said
joanna
who
had
been
hanging
on
the
hall
gate
waiting
for
her
mother
and
who
put
an
affectionate
arm
about
her
as
they
walked
up
the
path
you
look
better
jo
said
burgoyne
seriously
there
one
sure
cure
for
the
blues
in
this
world
i
recommend
it
to
you
for
it
safer
than
cocaine
and
just
as
sure
go
and
do
something
you
do
want
to
for
somebody
else
chapter
xvi
it
was
no
pleasant
prospect
of
a
reunion
at
the
club
or
an
evening
with
his
old
friends
that
had
taken
barry
valentine
so
suddenly
to
san
francisco
but
a
letter
from
his
wife
or
rather
from
his
mother
for
hetty
herself
never
wrote
which
had
stirred
a
vague
distrust
and
discomfort
in
his
mind
scott
his
was
a
worldly
shrewd
little
person
but
and
as
easily
moved
or
stirred
as
a
child
this
was
one
of
her
characteristic
letters
disconnected
and
scrawled
upon
scented
lavender
paper
she
wrote
that
she
and
hetty
were
sick
of
san
francisco
and
they
wanted
barry
permission
to
sell
the
mission
street
flats
that
afforded
them
a
living
and
go
away
once
and
for
all
het
her
mother
wrote
had
had
a
fine
offer
for
the
houses
barry
signature
only
was
needed
to
close
the
deal
all
this
might
be
true
it
sounded
reasonable
enough
but
somehow
barry
fancied
that
it
was
not
true
or
at
least
that
it
was
only
partly
so
what
did
hetty
want
the
money
for
he
wondered
why
should
her
mother
reiterate
so
many
times
that
if
barry
for
any
possible
reason
disapproved
he
was
not
to
give
the
matter
another
thought
they
most
especially
wanted
only
his
simple
yes
or
no
why
this
consideration
hetty
had
always
been
persistent
enough
about
the
things
she
wanted
before
i
know
you
would
consent
if
you
could
see
how
our
hearts
are
set
on
this
wrote
scott
but
if
you
say
that
ends
it
sure
i
sell
barry
said
putting
the
letter
in
his
pocket
but
it
came
persistently
between
him
and
his
work
what
mischief
was
hetty
in
he
wondered
had
some
shark
got
hold
of
her
it
was
extremely
likely
he
could
not
shake
the
thought
of
her
from
his
mind
her
voice
her
pretty
sullen
little
face
rose
again
and
haunted
him
what
a
child
she
had
been
and
what
a
boy
he
was
and
how
mistaken
the
whole
bitter
experience
walking
home
late
at
night
the
memory
of
old
days
rode
him
like
a
hateful
nightmare
he
saw
the
little
untidy
flat
they
had
had
in
new
york
the
white
winter
outside
and
a
deeper
chill
within
little
billy
coughing
and
restless
hetty
practising
her
scales
and
he
barry
trying
to
write
at
one
end
of
the
table
he
remembered
how
disappointment
and
restless
ambition
had
blotted
out
her
fresh
babyish
beauty
how
thin
and
sharp
her
voice
had
grown
as
the
months
went
on
barry
tried
to
read
but
the
book
became
mere
printed
words
he
went
softly
into
billy
room
and
sat
down
by
the
tumbled
bed
and
the
small
warm
sleeper
billy
even
asleep
snuggled
his
hand
appreciatively
into
his
father
and
brought
its
little
fellow
to
lie
there
too
and
pushed
his
head
up
against
barry
arm
and
there
the
father
sat
motionless
while
the
clock
outside
in
the
hall
struck
two
and
three
and
four
this
was
hetty
baby
and
where
was
hetty
alone
with
her
little
fretful
mother
moving
from
to
pretty
no
longer
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
of
an
operatic
career
no
longer
pinched
as
they
must
be
pinched
in
money
matters
the
thought
came
to
him
suddenly
that
he
must
see
her
and
though
he
fought
it
as
unwelcome
and
distasteful
it
grew
rapidly
into
a
conviction
he
must
see
her
again
must
have
a
long
talk
with
her
must
ascertain
that
nothing
he
could
do
for
the
woman
who
had
been
his
wife
was
left
undone
he
was
no
longer
the
exacting
unsuccessful
boy
she
had
left
so
unceremoniously
he
was
a
man
now
standing
on
his
own
feet
and
with
a
recognized
position
in
the
community
the
little
fretful
baby
was
a
young
person
who
attended
kindergarten
and
sunday
school
a
new
era
of
respectability
and
prosperity
had
set
in
hetty
his
newly
awakened
sense
of
justice
and
his
newly
aroused
ambition
told
him
must
somehow
share
it
not
that
there
could
ever
be
a
complete
reconciliation
between
them
but
there
could
be
there
could
be
a
readjustment
and
a
friendlier
understanding
the
thought
of
sidney
came
suddenly
upon
his
idle
musings
with
a
shock
that
made
his
heart
sick
gracious
beautiful
and
fresh
although
she
was
older
than
hetty
how
far
she
was
removed
from
this
sordid
story
of
his
this
darker
side
of
his
life
perhaps
months
from
now
his
troubled
thoughts
ran
on
he
would
tell
her
of
his
visit
to
hetty
for
he
had
determined
to
visit
her
just
at
dawn
he
left
the
house
and
went
out
of
his
own
gate
his
face
was
pale
his
eyes
deeply
ringed
and
his
head
ached
furiously
but
it
was
with
a
sort
of
content
that
he
took
his
seat
in
the
early
train
for
san
francisco
he
sank
into
a
reverie
head
propped
on
hand
that
lasted
until
his
journey
was
almost
over
but
once
in
the
city
his
old
dread
of
seeing
his
wife
came
over
him
again
and
it
was
only
after
a
leisurely
luncheon
at
the
club
that
barry
took
a
turk
street
car
to
the
dingy
region
where
hetty
lived
the
row
of
dirty
houses
on
either
side
of
the
street
and
the
dust
and
papers
blowing
about
in
the
hot
afternoon
wind
somehow
reminded
him
forcibly
of
old
days
and
ways
with
a
sinking
heart
he
went
up
one
of
the
flights
of
wooden
steps
and
asked
at
the
door
for
valentine
a
japanese
boy
in
his
ushered
him
into
a
front
room
this
was
evidently
the
parlor
hot
sunlight
streamed
through
the
bay
windows
there
was
an
upright
piano
against
the
closed
folding
doors
and
a
graphophone
on
a
dusty
cherry
table
wind
whined
at
the
one
or
two
big
flies
buzzed
against
the
glass
after
a
while
smiley
the
widow
who
conducted
this
little
who
was
a
cousin
of
hetty
and
whom
barry
had
known
years
ago
came
in
she
was
a
tall
angular
blonde
cheerlessly
resigned
to
a
cheerless
existence
with
her
came
a
freckled
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
with
his
finger
still
marking
a
place
in
the
book
he
had
been
reading
aloud
hetty
and
her
mother
were
out
it
appeared
smiley
did
think
they
would
be
back
to
dinner
in
fact
she
reiterated
nervously
she
was
sure
they
would
she
was
extremely
and
maddeningly
no
she
did
know
why
they
wanted
to
sell
the
mission
street
flats
she
had
warned
them
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
bother
barry
about
it
no
she
did
know
when
he
could
see
them
tomorrow
she
guessed
almost
any
time
barry
went
away
full
of
uneasy
suspicions
and
more
than
ever
convinced
that
something
was
wrong
he
went
back
again
the
next
morning
but
nobody
but
the
japanese
boy
appeared
to
be
at
home
but
a
visit
in
the
late
afternoon
was
more
successful
for
he
found
smiley
and
the
tall
son
again
hetty
is
here
is
she
he
burst
out
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
meaningless
conversation
smiley
turned
pale
and
tried
to
laugh
where
else
would
she
be
she
demanded
and
she
went
back
to
her
interrupted
dissertation
upon
the
unpleasantness
of
several
specified
boarders
then
under
her
roof
it
is
funny
barry
mused
what
did
she
say
when
she
went
out
why
smiley
began
uncomfortably
but
my
gracious
i
wish
you
would
ask
aunt
ide
barry
she
interrupted
herself
uncomfortably
she
tell
you
she
the
one
to
ask
aunt
ide
was
scott
tell
me
what
he
persisted
you
tell
me
lulu
that
a
dear
auntie
tell
you
she
repeated
adding
suddenly
to
the
boy
russy
was
aunt
ide
in
her
room
when
you
went
up
you
run
up
and
see
nome
said
russell
positively
but
nevertheless
he
went
nice

lulu
said
barry
in
his
idle
way
but
he
looks
thin
he
the
finest
little
feller
god
ever
sent
a
woman
the
mother
answered
with
sudden
passionate
pride
color
leaped
to
her
sallow
cheeks
but
this
house
is
no
place
for
him
to
be
cooped
up
reading
all
day
she
went
on
in
a
worried
tone
after
a
moment
and
i
ca
let
him
run
with
the
boys
around
here
it
a
regular
gang
i
do
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
him
is
as
if
he
had
a
father
he
would
like
to
come
up
to
me
and
get
broken
on
the
mail
barry
queried
in
his
interested
way

get
lots
of
fresh
air
and
he
could
sleep
at
my
house
i
keep
an
eye
on
him
if

so
go
on
the
newspaper

crazy
with
joy
his
mother
said
tears
came
into
her
faded
eyes
barry
you
real
to
offer
it
she
said
gratefully
of
all
things
in
the
world
that

one
russ

but
wo

in
your
way

and
send
him
along
if
he
does
like
it
i
guess
his
mother
let
him
come
home
like
it
she
echoed
then
in
a
lower
tone
she
added
you
do
know
what
a
load
you
taking
off
my
mind
barry
she
paused
colored
again
and
to
his
surprise
continued
rapidly
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
door
barry
i
never
did
a
thing
like
this
before
in
my
life
and
i
ca
do
it
now
you
know
how
much
i
owe
aunt
ide
she
took
me
in
and
did
for
me
just
as
she
did
for
het
when
i
was
a
baby
she
made
my
wedding
dress
and
she
came
right
to
me
when
gus
died
but
i
ca
let
you
go
back
to
santa
paloma
not
knowing
not
knowing
what
barry
said
close
upon
the
mystery
at
last
you
know
what
aunt
ide
is
smiley
said
pleadingly
there
not
a
mite
of
harm
in
her
but
she
just
you
know
she
been
signing
hetty
checks
for
a
long
time
barry
go
on
barry
said
as
she
paused
distressedly
and
she
just
went
on
smiley
continued
simply
went
on
what
barry
demanded
after
het
went
barry
the
woman
interrupted
herself
i
ought
be
the
one
to
tell
you
but
do
you
see
do
you
see
het
dead
barry
heard
his
own
voice
say
heavily
the
cheap
little
room
seemed
to
be
closing
in
about
him
he
gripped
the
back
of
the
chair
by
which
he
was
standing
smiley
began
to
cry
quietly
they
stood
so
for
a
long
time
after
a
while
he
sat
down
and
she
told
him
about
it
with
that
faithfulness
to
inessential
detail
that
marks
her
class
barry
listened
like
a
man
in
a
dream
smiley
begged
him
to
stay
to
dinner
to
see
aunt
ide
but
he
refused
and
in
the
gritty
dusk
he
found
himself
walking
down
the
street
alone
in
silence
at
last
he
took
a
car
to
the
ocean
beach
and
far
into
the
night
sat
on
the
rocks
watching
the
dark
play
of
the
rolling
pacific
and
listening
to
the
steady
rush
and
fall
of
the
water
the
next
day
he
saw
his
wife
mother
and
at
the
sight
of
her
frightened
fat
little
face
and
the
sound
of
the
high
voice
he
knew
so
well
the
last
shred
of
his
anger
and
disgust
vanished
and
he
could
only
pity
her
he
remembered
how
welcome
she
had
made
him
to
the
little
cottage
in
plumas
those
long
years
ago
how
she
had
laughed
at
his
youthful
appreciation
of
her
sunday
fried
chicken
and
cherry
pie
and
the
honest
tears
she
had
shed
when
he
went
with
the
dimpled
hetty
beside
him
to
tell
her
her
daughter
was
won
she
was
grandmother
after
all
and
she
had
at
least
seen
that
hetty
was
protected
all
through
her
misguided
little
career
from
the
breath
of
scandal
and
that
hetty
last
days
were
made
comfortable
and
serene
he
assured
her
gruffly
that
it
was
all
right
and
she
presently
brightened
and
told
him
through
tears
that
he
was
a
king
when
it
was
finally
arranged
that
she
should
go
on
drawing
the
rents
of
the
mission
street
property
for
the
rest
of
her
life
she
and
smiley
persuaded
him
to
dine
with
them
and
he
thought
it
quite
characteristic
of
aunt
ide
to
make
a
little
occasion
of
it
and
take
them
to
a
certain
favored
little
french
restaurant
for
the
meal
but
smiley
was
tremulous
with
gratitude
and
relief
russell
face
was
radiant
his
adoring
eyes
all
for
barry
and
barry
always
willing
to
accept
a
situation
gracefully
really
enjoyed
his
dinner
he
stayed
in
san
francisco
another
day
and
went
to
hetty
grave
high
up
in
the
piedmont
hills
and
took
a
long
lonely
tramp
above
the
college
town
afterward
early
the
next
morning
he
started
for
home
fresh
from
a
bath
and
a
good
breakfast
and
feeling
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
free
and
that
it
was
good
to
be
free
free
to
work
and
to
plan
his
life
and
free
his
innermost
consciousness
exulted
to
realize
to
go
to
her
some
day
the
lady
of
his
heart
desire
and
take
her
with
all
the
fragrance
and
beauty
that
were
part
of
her
into
his
arms
and
oh
the
happy
years
ahead
he
seemed
to
feel
the
sweetness
of
spring
winds
blowing
across
them
and
the
glow
of
winter
fires
making
them
bright
what
of
her
fabulous
wealth
after
all
if
he
could
support
her
as
she
chose
to
live
a
simple
country
in
a
little
country
town
barry
stared
out
at
the
morning
fields
and
hills
where
fog
and
sunshine
were
holding
their
daily
battle
and
his
heart
sang
within
him
fog
held
the
field
at
santa
paloma
when
he
reached
it
the
station
building
dripped
somberly
main
street
was
but
a
line
of
vague
shapes
in
the
mist
no
grown
person
was
in
sight
but
barry
was
not
ten
feet
from
the
train
before
a
screaming
horde
of
small
boys
was
upon
him
with
shouted
news
in
which
he
recognized
the
one
word
over
and
over
fire
it
took
him
a
few
minutes
to
get
the
sense
of
what
they
said
he
stared
at
them
dully
but
when
he
first
repeated
it
to
himself
aloud
it
seemed
already
old
news
he
felt
as
if
he
had
known
it
for
a
very
long
time
the
mail
office
caught
fire
yesterday
and
the
whole
thing
is
burned
to
the
ground
caught
fire
yesterday
and
the
whole
thing
is
burned
to
the
ground
yes
of
course
barry
said
he
was
not
conscious
of
starting
for
the
scene
he
was
simply
there
a
fringe
of
idle
watchers
obscured
in
the
fog
stood
about
the
sunken
ruins
of
what
had
been
the
mail
building
barry
joined
them
he
did
not
answer
when
a
dozen
sympathetic
murmurs
addressed
him
because
he
was
not
conscious
of
hearing
a
single
voice
he
stood
silently
looking
down
at
the
twisted
great
knots
of
metal
that
had
been
the
new
presses
the
great
wave
of
soaked
and
newspapers
that
had
been
the
last
issue
of
the
mail
the
fire
had
been
hours
ago
but
the
ruins
were
still
smoking
lengths
of
charred
woodwork
giving
forth
a
sickening
odor
dripped
water
still
here
and
there
brave
little
spurts
of
flame
still
sucked
noisily
a
twisted
typewriter
stood
erect
in
steaming
ashes
a
with
a
red
fringed
napkin
in
it
had
somehow
escaped
with
only
a
wetting
barry
noticed
that
the
walls
of
the
german
bakery
next
door
were
badly
singed
that
one
was
cracked
across
and
that
the
frosted
inside
stood
in
a
pool
of
dirty
water
he
was
presently
aware
that
someone
was
telling
him
that
nobody
was
to
blame
details
were
volunteered
and
he
listened
quietly
like
a
dispassionate
onlooker
hits
you
pretty
hard
barry
sympathetic
voices
said
ruins
me
he
answered
briefly
and
it
dawned
upon
him
sickly
and
certainly
that
it
was
true
he
was
ruined
now
all
his
hopes
had
been
rooted
here
in
what
was
now
this
mass
of
wet
ashes
steaming
up
into
the
fog
here
had
been
his
chance
for
a
livelihood
and
a
name
his
chance
to
stand
before
the
community
for
what
was
good
and
strong
and
helpful
he
had
been
proud
because
his
editorials
were
beginning
to
be
quoted
here
and
there
he
had
been
keenly
ambitious
for
sidney
plans
her
hopes
for
old
paloma
how
vain
it
all
was
now
and
how
preposterous
it
seemed
that
only
an
hour
ago
he
had
let
his
thoughts
of
the
future
include
her
always
so
far
above
him
and
now
so
infinitely
removed
she
would
be
sympathetic
he
knew
she
would
be
all
kindness
and
generosity
and
perhaps
six
months
ago
he
would
have
accepted
more
generosity
from
her
but
barry
had
found
himself
now
and
he
knew
that
she
had
done
for
him
all
he
would
let
her
do
he
smiled
suddenly
and
grimly
as
he
remembered
another
bridge
just
burned
behind
him
if
he
had
not
promised
hetty
mother
that
her
income
should
go
on
uninterruptedly
he
might
have
pulled
something
out
of
this
wreckage
after
all
for
a
moment
he
speculated
he
could
sell
the
mission
street
property
now
he
might
even
revive
the
mail
after
a
while
but
no
what
was
promised
was
promised
after
all
and
poor
little
scott
must
be
left
to
what
peace
and
pleasure
the
certainty
of
an
income
gave
her
and
he
must
begin
again
somehow
somewhere
burdened
with
a
debt
burdened
with
a
heartache
burdened
with
his
heart
turned
with
sudden
warmth
to
the
thought
of
billy
billy
at
least
staunch
little
partner
of
so
many
dark
days
and
bright
should
not
be
counted
a
burden
even
as
he
thought
of
his
son
a
small
warm
hand
slid
into
his
with
a
reassuring
pressure
and
lie
looked
down
to
see
the
little
figure
beside
him
moment
after
moment
went
by
timid
shafts
of
gold
sunshine
were
beginning
to
conquer
the
mist
now
and
still
father
and
son
stood
silent
hand
in
hand
chapter
xvii
the
mischief
was
done
no
use
to
stand
there
by
the
smoking
ruins
of
what
had
been
his
one
real
hope
for
himself
and
his
life
after
a
while
barry
roused
himself
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
at
the
moment
no
more
to
be
said
he
and
billy
walked
up
river
street
to
their
own
gate
but
when
they
reached
it
barry
obeying
an
irresistible
impulse
merely
left
his
coat
and
there
and
went
on
through
the
hall
gateway
and
up
to
the
house
the
sun
was
coming
out
bravely
now
and
already
he
felt
its
warmth
in
the
garden
everywhere
the
fog
was
rising
was
fading
against
the
green
of
the
trees
he
followed
a
delicious
odor
of
wood
smoke
and
the
sound
of
voices
to
the
barnyard
and
here
found
the
lady
of
the
house
with
her
inevitable
accompaniment
of
interested
children
sidney
was
managing
an
immense
brush
fire
with
a
long
pole
her
gingham
skirt
pinned
back
trimly
over
a
striped
petticoat
her
cheeks
flushed
her
hair
riotous
under
a
gipsy
hat
at
barry
first
word
she
dropped
her
pole
her
whole
face
grew
radiant
and
she
came
toward
him
holding
out
both
her
hands
barry
she
said
eagerly
her
eyes
trying
to
read
his
face
how
glad
i
am
you
come
we
did
know
how
to
reach
you
you
heard
of
course
you
seen
the
poor
old
mail
yes
i
just
from
there
he
said
soberly
can
we
talk
as
long
as
you
like
she
answered
briskly
and
after
some
directions
to
the
children
she
led
him
to
the
little
garden
seat
below
the
side
porch
and
they
sat
down
barry
you
look
tired
she
said
then
do
you
know
i
do
know
where
you
been
all
these
days
or
what
you
went
for
was
it
to
san
francisco
san
francisco
yes
he
assented
i
did
dream
i
be
there
so
long
he
rubbed
his
forehead
with
a
weary
hand
i
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
he
said
i
had
a
letter
from
my
wife
mother
that
worried
me
and
i
started
off
at
i
got
worrying
but
of
course
i
should
have
written
you
do
bother
about
that
now
if
it
distresses
you
she
said
quickly
and
sympathetically
any
time
will
do
for
that
i
i
knew
it
was
something
serious
she
went
on
relief
in
her
voice
or
you
have
simply
disappeared
that
way
i
i
said
so
barry
are
you
hungry
he
tried
to
laugh
at
the
maternal
attitude
that
was
never
long
absent
in
her
but
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
instead
after
all
the
strain
and
sleeplessness
and
despondency
it
was
too
poignantly
sweet
to
find
her
so
simply
cheering
and
trustful
in
her
gipsy
dress
with
the
brightening
sunlight
and
the
sweet
old
garden
about
her
barry
could
have
dropped
on
his
knees
to
bury
his
face
in
her
skirts
and
feel
the
motherly
hands
on
his
hair
but
instead
he
admitted
honestly
to
hunger
and
fatigue
sidney
vanished
at
once
and
presently
came
back
followed
by
her
black
cook
both
carrying
a
breakfast
that
barry
was
to
enjoy
at
once
under
the
rose
vines
sidney
poured
his
coffee
and
sat
contentedly
nibbling
toast
while
he
fell
upon
the
cold
chicken
and
blackberries
now
said
her
heartening
voice
we
talk
what
is
to
be
done
first
about
the
mail
no
insurance
you
know
he
began
at
once
we
never
did
carry
any
in
the
old
days
and
i
suppose
that
why
i
did
so
that
makes
it
a
dead
loss
worse
than
that
for
i
was
clear
yet
you
know
the
safe
they
carried
out
so
the
books
are
all
right
i
suppose
although
they
say
we
had
better
not
open
it
for
a
few
days
then
i
can
settle
everything
up
as
far
as
possible
and
after
that
well
i
been
thinking
that
perhaps
barker
of
the
san
francisco
telegram
might
give
me
a
start
of
some
sort
he
rumpled
his
hair
with
a
desperate
gesture
the
come
on
me
like
such
a
thunderbolt
that
i
really
have
thought
it
out
he
ended
apologetically
the
thing
come
on
you
like
such
a
thunderbolt
she
echoed
cheerfully
that
you
are
taking
it
like
yourself
at
all
the
question
is
if
we
work
like
trojans
from
now
on
can
we
get
an
issue
of
the
mail
out
tomorrow
get
an
issue
out
tomorrow
he
repeated
staring
at
her
certainly
i
would
have
done
what
i
could
about
it
said
sidney
briskly
but
not
knowing
where
you
were
or
when
you
were
coming
back
my
hands
were
absolutely
tied
now
barry
listen
she
broke
off
not
reassured
by
his
expression
and
do
jump
at
the
conclusion
that
it
impossible
what
would
it
mean
to
get
an
issue
of
the
mail
out
tomorrow
why
great
scott
sid
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
there
not
a
stick
left
standing
i
do
realize
i
was
there
until
the
fire
was
out
she
said
calmly
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
talked
of
the
fire
then
she
said
abruptly
would
ferguson
let
you
use
the
old
star
press
for
a
few
weeks
do
you
think
i
do
see
why
he
should
barry
said
perversely
i
do
see
why
he
should
i
tell
you
something
you
do
know
night
before
last
barry
while
i
was
down
in
the
office
old
ferguson
himself
came
in
and
poked
about
and
asked
various
questions
finally
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
the
chances
were
of
your
wanting
to
buy
out
the
star
what
do
you
think
at
that
he
sick
of
it
is
he
barry
said
with
kindling
eyes
well
seen
that
coming
have
we
i
will
be
darned
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
that
would
have
been
a
big
thing
for
the
mail
he
said
but
it
all
up
now
not
necessarily
the
lady
undauntedly
rejoined
i
been
thinking
barry
she
went
on
if
you
reordered
the
presses
they
give
you
plenty
of
time
to
pay
for
them
would
they
might
even
take
something
off
the
price
under
the
circumstances
i
suppose
they
might
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
but
that
just
one
one
item
i
know
but
it
the
main
item
then
you
could
rent
the
office
and
loft
over
the
old
station
could
you
and
move
the
old
star
press
in
there
this
afternoon
this
afternoon
said
barry
calmly
well
we
do
gain
anything
by
waiting
you
can
write
a
manly
and
affecting
editorial
her
always
irrepressible
laughter
broke
out
full
of
allusions
to
the
phoenix
you
know
and
my
regular
saturday
column
is
all
done
and
miss
porter
can
send
in
something
and
any
amount
of
stuff
about
the
folsom
lawsuit
and
young
mason
and
company
ought
to
take
at
least
a
page
to
advertise
their
premium
day
i
come
down
as
soon
as
you
moved
barry
reached
for
his
hat
the
thing
ca
be
done
he
announced
firmly
but
by
george
sid
you
would
give
a
field
mouse
courage
and
what
a
grandstand
play
if
we
could
put
it
through
there
not
a
second
to
be
lost
though
but
look
here
and
with
sudden
gravity
he
took
both
her
hands
it
take
some
more
money
you
know
i
have
some
more
money
she
answered
serenely
well
i
get
some
he
declared
emphatically
it
wo
be
so
much
either
once
we
get
started
and
so
old
ferguson
wanted
to
sell
did
he
he
did
and
we
buy
the
star
yet
they
were
on
the
path
now
telephone
me
when
you
can
she
said
and
do
lose
a
minute
now
good
luck
and
barry
great
stride
had
taken
him
down
river
street
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
mind
awhirl
with
plans
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
told
her
the
news
of
hetty
after
all
chapter
xviii
on
that
same
afternoon
several
of
the
most
influential
members
of
the
santa
paloma
woman
club
met
informally
at
carew
house
some
of
the
directors
were
there
miss
pratt
lloyd
and
adams
and
of
course
white
who
had
indeed
been
instrumental
in
arranging
the
meeting
they
had
met
to
discuss
burgoyne
plan
of
using
the
clubhouse
as
a
meeting
place
for
the
old
paloma
factory
girls
all
these
ladies
were
quite
aware
that
their
verdict
however
unofficial
would
influence
the
rest
of
the
club
and
that
what
this
group
of
a
dozen
or
fifteen
decided
upon
would
practically
settle
the
matter
willard
white
hitherto
serenely
supreme
in
this
little
world
was
curiously
upset
about
the
whole
thing
openly
opposed
to
burgoyne
suggestion
and
surprised
that
her
mere
wish
in
the
matter
was
not
sufficient
to
carry
a
negative
vote
her
contention
was
that
the
clubhouse
had
been
built
for
very
different
purposes
than
those
burgoyne
proposed
and
that
charity
to
the
old
paloma
girls
had
no
part
in
the
club
original
reasons
for
being
she
meant
in
the
course
of
the
argument
to
hint
that
while
so
many
of
the
actual
necessities
of
decent
living
were
lacking
in
the
factory
settlement
homes
mere
dancing
and
did
not
appeal
to
her
as
reasonable
or
right
and
although
uneasily
aware
that
she
supported
the
unpopular
argument
still
she
was
confident
of
an
eventual
triumph
but
despite
the
usual
laughter
and
the
pleasantries
and
compliments
there
was
an
air
of
deadly
earnestness
about
the
gathered
today
that
bespoke
a
deeper
interest
than
was
common
in
the
matter
up
for
discussion
the
president
color
rose
and
deepened
steadily
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
one
voice
after
another
declared
for
the
new
plan
and
her
arguments
became
a
little
less
impersonal
and
a
little
more
sharp
this
was
especially
noticeable
when
as
was
inevitable
the
name
of
burgoyne
was
introduced
i
personally
feel
said
white
finally
that
perhaps
we
santa
paloma
women
are
just
a
little
bit
undignified
when
we
allow
a
perfect
stranger
to
come
in
among
us
and
influence
our
lives
so
materially
just
because
she
happens
to
be
a
are
we
so
swayed
by
mere
money
i
hope
not
i
hope
we
all
live
our
lives
as
suits
us
best
not
to
please
or
shall
i
say
flatter
and
perhaps
win
favor
with
a
rich
woman
we
some
of
us
that
is
her
smile
was
all
lenience
have
suddenly
decided
we
can
dress
more
simply
have
suddenly
decided
to
put
our
girls
into
gingham
rompers
and
instead
of
giving
them
little
dancing
parties
let
them
play
about
like
boys
we
wonder
why
we
need
spend
our
money
on
imported
hats
and
nice
dinners
and
underwear
and
oriental
rugs
although
we
thought
these
things
very
well
worth
having
a
few
months
ago
and
why
just
because
we
are
easily
led
i
afraid
and
not
quite
conscious
enough
of
our
own
dignity
there
had
been
a
decided
heightening
of
color
among
the
listening
women
during
this
little
speech
and
as
the
president
finished
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
rested
upon
her
with
a
slightly
resentful
steadiness
there
was
a
short
silence
in
which
several
women
were
gathering
their
thoughts
for
speech
but
brown
always
popular
in
santa
paloma
from
the
days
of
her
short
braids
and
short
dresses
and
quite
the
youngest
among
them
was
the
first
to
speak
i
daresay
that
is
quite
true
white
said
brown
with
dignity
except
that
i
do
think
burgoyne
money
influences
me
or
any
of
us
i
admit
that
she
herself
quite
apart
from
her
great
fortune
has
influenced
me
tremendously
in
lots
of
ways
but
i
think
she
ever
tried
to
do
it
or
realizes
that
she
has
and
as
far
as
copying
goes
do
we
women
always
copy
somebody
anyway
are
we
always
imitating
the
san
francisco
women
and
do
they
copy
new
york
and
does
new
york
copy
london
or
paris
we
read
what
feathers
are
in
and
how
skirts
are
cut
and
how
coffee
and
salads
are
served
and
we
all
do
it
or
try
to
and
when
burgoyne
came
to
the
hall
and
never
took
one
particle
of
interest
in
that
sort
of
thing
i
just
thought
it
over
and
wondered
why
i
should
attempt
to
impress
a
woman
who
could
buy
this
whole
town
and
not
miss
the
money
laughter
interrupted
her
and
some
sympathetic
clapping
but
she
presently
went
on
seriously
i
took
all
the
boys
white
socks
one
day
and
dyed
them
dark
brown
and
i
dyed
all
their
white
suits
dark
blue
i
gotten
myself
some
galatea
dresses
that
nothing
tears
or
spoils
and
that
come
home
fresh
and
sweet
from
the
wash
every
week
and
as
a
result
i
actually
have
some
time
to
spare
for
the
first
time
since
i
was
married
we
are
going
to
try
some
educational
experiments
on
the
children
this
winter
and
if
that
leaves
any
leisure
i
am
heart
and
soul
for
this
new
plan
doctor
brown
feels
as
i
do
of
course
he
a
doctor
said
the
loyal
little
wife
and
he
knows
and
he
says
that
all
those
old
paloma
girls
want
is
a
little
mothering
and
that
when
there
are
mothers
enough
to
go
round
there
wo
be
any
charity
or
legislation
needed
in
this
world
i
think
you
said
it
all
for
all
of
us
mary
carew
said
when
some
affectionate
applause
had
subsided
i
think
things
were
probably
different
a
few
generations
ago
she
went
on
but
nowadays
when
fashions
are
so
arbitrary
and
change
so
fast
really
and
honestly
some
of
us
whose
incomes
are
limited
will
have
to
stop
somewhere
why
the
very
children
expect
and
and
caterers
suppers
in
these
days
and
one
would
mind
if
it
left
time
for
home
life
and
reading
and
family
intercourse
but
it
does
we
do
know
what
our
children
are
studying
what
thinking
about
or
what
life
means
to
them
at
all
because
we
are
too
busy
answering
the
telephone
and
planning
clothes
and
writing
formal
notes
and
going
to
places
we
feel
we
ought
to
be
seen
in
i
having
more
fun
than
i
had
in
years
helping
our
children
plan
some
abridged
plays
from
shakespeare
with
the
burgoyne
girls
for
this
winter
and
i
perfectly
astonished
even
though
i
their
mother
at
their
enjoyment
of
it
and
at
my
own
carew
himself
who
never
takes
much
interest
in
that
sort
of
thing
asked
me
why
they
could
give
them
for
the
old
paloma
girls
club
if
they
get
a
club
room
i
did
know
he
even
knew
anything
about
our
club
plans
i
said
are
you
willing
to
have
jeannette
get
interested
in
that
crowd
and
he
said
thing
in
the
world
for
her
and
i
do
know
finished
carew
thoughtfully
but
what
he
right
i
all
for
it
said
breezy
lloyd
i
do
imagine
i
be
any
good
at
actually
talking
to
them
but
i
would
go
to
the
dances
and
introduce
people
and
trot
partners
up
to
the
wallflowers
there
was
more
laughter
and
then
adams
said
briskly
well
let
take
an
informal
vote
i
do
think
that
necessary
sue
said
white
generously
i
think
i
am
the
only
one
of
us
who
believes
in
preserving
the
tradition
of
the
dear
old
club
and
i
must
bow
to
the
majority
of
course
perhaps
it
will
be
a
little
hard
to
see
strangers
there
our
pretty
floors
ruined
and
our
pretty
walls
spotted
but
an
eloquent
shrug
and
a
gesture
of
her
pretty
hands
finished
the
sentence
with
the
words
is
that
the
law
and
upon
applause
for
white
carew
tactfully
introduced
the
subject
of
tea
they
were
all
chatting
amicably
enough
in
the
a
few
minutes
later
when
george
carew
and
barry
valentine
came
in
barry
who
seemed
excited
exhilarated
and
tired
had
come
to
borrow
a
typewriter
from
the
carews
he
responded
to
sympathetic
inquiries
that
he
had
been
working
like
a
madman
since
noon
and
that
there
would
be
an
issue
of
the
mail
ready
for
them
in
the
morning
he
said
everyone
had
been
simply
corking
about
everything
and
it
began
to
look
like
smooth
sailing
now
in
the
few
minutes
that
he
waited
for
young
george
carew
to
find
the
typewriter
and
bring
it
down
to
him
a
fresh
interruption
occurred
in
the
entrance
of
old
apostleman
apostleman
between
being
out
of
breath
from
hurrying
up
the
hill
in
the
late
afternoon
heat
and
fearful
that
the
gathering
would
break
up
before
she
could
say
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
entirely
unable
to
control
her
gasping
and
puffing
was
a
sight
at
once
funny
and
pitiable
as
she
sank
into
a
comfortable
chair
she
held
up
one
fat
hand
to
command
attention
and
with
the
other
laid
forcible
hold
upon
barry
valentine
three
or
four
of
the
younger
women
hurried
to
her
with
fans
and
tea
and
in
a
moment
or
two
she
really
could
manage
disconnected
words
thanks
me
dear
no
no
cake
just
a
mouthful
of
tea
to
there
better
i
was
afraid
ye
all
be
gone
that
do
thank
ye
susie
well
she
set
down
her
well
i
a
little
piece
of
news
for
you
all
do
go
barry
you
be
interested
in
this
and
i
wait
to
come
up
and
tell
ye
she
began
to
fumble
in
her
bag
and
presently
produced
therefrom
her
and
a
letter
the
latter
she
opened
with
a
great
crackling
of
paper
this
is
from
me
brother
alexander
wetherall
said
she
with
an
impressive
glance
over
her
glasses
as
ye
know
he
a
family
lawyer
in
new
york
he
has
the
histories
of
half
the
old
families
in
the
country
away
in
those
old
offices
of
his
he
does
write
me
very
often
his
wife
does
now
and
then
stupid
woman
but
nice
however
i
wrote
him
in
may
and
told
him
burgoyne
had
bought
the
hall
and
just
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
her
and
her
people
here
marking
a
certain
line
with
a
pudgy
imperative
finger
she
handed
a
page
of
the
letter
to
barry
read
from
there
on
she
commanded
this
is
what
he
says
barry
took
the
paper
but
hesitated
it
all
right
said
the
old
lady
impatiently
nobody
could
say
anything
that
was
good
about
sidney
burgoyne
thus
reassured
barry
turned
obediently
to
the
indicated
place
ask
me
about
your
new
neighbor
he
read
suppose
of
course
you
know
that
she
is
paul
frothingham
only
child
by
his
second
marriage
her
mother
died
while
she
was
a
baby
and
frothingham
took
her
all
over
the
world
with
him
wherever
he
went
she
married
very
young
colonel
john
burgoyne
of
the
maryland
family
older
than
she
but
a
very
fine
fellow
as
a
girl
and
as
his
wife
she
had
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
social
success
she
was
a
great
favorite
in
the
diplomatic
circle
at
washington
and
well
known
in
the
best
london
set
and
in
the
european
capitals
she
seems
to
be
quite
a
remarkable
young
woman
but
you
are
all
wrong
about
her
money
she
is
very
far
from
rich
she
barry
stopped
short
apostleman
cackled
delightedly
no
one
else
stirred
got
very
little
of
frothingham
money
barry
presently
read
on
it
came
to
him
from
his
first
wife
who
was
a
widow
with
two
daughters
when
he
married
her
the
money
naturally
reverted
to
her
girls
fred
senior
and
spencer
mack
both
of
this
city
ha
d
get
that
said
apostleman
go
on
left
his
own
daughter
something
considerably
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
barry
presently
resumed
more
than
seventy
or
eighty
thousand
certainly
it
is
still
invested
in
the
estate
it
must
pay
her
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
and
besides
that
she
has
only
burgoyne
insurance
twenty
or
thousand
for
those
years
of
illness
pretty
well
used
up
his
own
money
i
believe
the
stepsisters
were
very
anxious
to
make
her
a
more
generous
arrangement
but
she
seems
to
have
declined
it
alice
says
they
are
quite
devoted
alice
do
count
said
the
old
lady
that
his
wife
enough
she
stopped
the
reader
and
refolded
the
letter
her
mischievous
eyes
dancing
well
what
d
think
of
that
she
demanded
barry
bewildered
well
i
will
be
darned
set
loose
a
babel
of
tongues
apostleman
had
not
counted
in
vain
upon
a
sensation
everyone
talked
at
once
white
high
merry
laugh
dominated
all
the
other
voices
so
there
is
a
very
much
better
reason
for
this
existence
than
we
supposed
said
the
president
of
the
santa
paloma
women
club
amusedly
when
the
first
rush
of
comment
died
away
i
think
that
is
quite
delicious
while
all
of
us
were
feeling
how
superior
she
was
not
to
get
a
motor
and
not
to
rebuild
the
hall
she
was
simply
living
within
her
income
and
making
the
best
of
it
i
do
know
that
it
makes
her
any
less
superior
carew
said
thoughtfully
it
it
certainly
makes
her
seem
nicer
i
never
suspected
her
of
well
of
preaching
exactly
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
she
really
could
enter
into
our
point
of
view
with
all
that
money
i
think
i
going
to
like
her
more
than
ever
she
finished
laughingly
why
it
the
greatest
relief
in
the
world
exclaimed
adams
i
been
rather
holding
back
about
going
up
there
and
imitating
her
because
i
honestly
did
want
to
be
influenced
by
eight
millions
and
i
was
afraid
i
was
not
a
week
ago
wayne
asked
me
if
i
thought
like
him
to
donate
a
sewing
machine
to
her
girls
club
for
them
to
run
up
their
little
costumes
with
he
has
the
agency
you
know
and
i
said
do
wayne
she
can
buy
them
a
sewing
machine
apiece
if
she
wants
to
and
never
know
it
but
i
going
to
make
him
write
her
said
adams
firmly
and
i
declare
i
feel
as
if
a
weight
had
dropped
off
my
shoulders
it
means
so
much
more
now
if
we
offer
her
the
club
it
means
that
we
are
merely
giving
a
lady
bountiful
her
way
but
that
we
all
working
together
like
neighbors
and
trying
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
and
i
do
think
there
any
question
that
she
would
live
exactly
this
way
miss
pratt
contributed
shyly
and
play
with
the
children
and
dress
as
she
does
even
if
she
had
fifty
millions
she
simply
found
out
what
pays
in
this
life
and
what
does
pay
and
i
think
a
good
many
of
us
were
living
too
hard
and
fast
ever
to
stop
and
think
whether
it
was
really
worth
while
or
not
she
the
happiest
woman
i
ever
knew
it
makes
one
happy
just
to
be
with
her
and
no
money
can
buy
that
but
it
curious
she
never
has
taken
the
trouble
to
undeceive
us
said
white
beginning
to
fit
on
an
immaculate
pair
of
white
gloves
finger
by
finger
why
you
see
she
never
dreamed
we
thought
she
was
anything
but
one
of
ourselves
brown
predicted
why
should
she
when
did
she
ever
speak
of
money
or
take
the
least
interest
in
money
she
never
speaks
of
it
she
says
ca
afford
the
time
or
i
ca
afford
the
effort
that
what
counts
with
her
does
it
barry
barry
do
you
really
suppose
carew
was
beginning
as
she
turned
to
the
doorway
where
he
had
been
standing
but
barry
had
gone
chapter
xix
barry
went
straight
up
to
the
hall
but
sidney
was
not
there
joanna
and
ellen
busily
murmuring
over
flower
ladies
on
the
wide
terrace
steps
told
him
that
mother
was
to
be
late
to
supper
and
with
obviously
forced
hospitality
and
one
eye
upon
their
little
families
of
inverted
roses
and
hollyhocks
asked
him
to
wait
barry
thanked
them
but
could
wait
he
went
like
a
man
in
a
dream
down
river
street
past
gardens
that
glowed
with
fragrant
beauty
and
under
the
great
trees
and
the
warm
sunset
sky
and
what
a
good
world
it
seemed
to
be
alive
in
and
what
a
friendly
village
in
which
to
find
work
and
love
and
content
a
dozen
returning
householders
stopping
at
their
gates
wanted
the
news
of
his
venture
a
dozen
interested
women
watering
lawns
in
the
shade
called
out
to
wish
him
good
fortune
and
always
before
his
eyes
the
thought
of
the
vanished
millions
danced
like
a
star
she
was
not
infinitely
removed
she
was
not
set
apart
by
great
fortune
she
was
only
the
sweetest
and
best
of
women
to
be
wooed
and
won
like
any
other
he
ran
upstairs
and
flung
open
the
door
of
the
little
bare
new
office
of
the
mail
like
an
impetuous
boy
there
was
no
one
there
but
a
wide
white
hat
with
a
yellow
rose
pinned
on
it
hung
above
the
new
oak
desk
in
the
corner
and
his
heart
rose
at
the
sight
his
own
desk
had
an
improvised
drop
light
hung
over
it
he
lowered
the
typewriter
from
his
cramped
arm
upon
a
mass
of
clippings
and
notes
beyond
this
room
was
the
great
bare
loft
where
two
or
three
oily
men
were
still
toiling
in
the
fading
light
over
the
establishing
of
the
old
star
press
sashes
had
been
taken
from
one
of
the
big
windows
to
admit
the
entrance
of
the
heavier
parts
thick
pulley
ropes
dangled
at
the
sill
great
unopened
bundles
of
gray
paper
filled
the
center
of
the
floor
a
slim
amused
youth
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
telephone
on
the
wall
and
sidney
very
and
keenly
interested
was
watching
everybody
and
making
suggestions
she
greeted
barry
with
a
cheerful
wave
of
the
hand
there
you
are
she
said
relievedly
come
and
see
what
you
think
of
this
do
you
know
this
office
is
going
to
be
much
nicer
than
the
old
one
how
goes
everything
with
you
like
lightning
he
answered
at
this
rate
there
nothing
to
it
at
all
have
the
press
boys
showed
up
yet
they
are
over
at
the
hotel
getting
their
dinners
she
explained
and
we
have
borrowed
lamps
from
the
hotel
to
use
here
this
evening
did
you
hear
that
martin
of
the
press
you
know
has
offered
to
send
over
the
news
as
fast
as
it
comes
in
is
that
very
decent
of
him
here
miss
porter
stuff
she
sat
down
and
began
to
assort
papers
on
her
desk
quite
absorbed
in
what
she
was
doing
barry
at
his
own
desk
opened
and
shut
a
drawer
or
two
noisily
but
he
was
really
watching
her
with
a
thumping
heart
watching
the
bare
brown
head
the
lowered
lashes
the
mouth
that
moved
occasionally
in
time
with
her
busy
thoughts
suddenly
she
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
without
the
faintest
consciousness
of
what
he
did
barry
crossed
the
floor
between
them
and
as
on
an
equally
unconscious
impulse
she
stood
up
paling
and
breathless
he
laid
his
hand
over
hers
on
the
littered
desk
and
they
stood
so
staring
at
each
other
the
desk
between
them
sidney
he
said
incoherently
who
where
where
did
your
money
go
who
got
it
she
looked
at
him
in
utter
bewilderment
where
did
what
father
money
who
got
it
are
you
crazy
barry
she
stammered
ah
sidney
tell
me
did
it
come
to
you
why
why
she
seemed
suddenly
to
understand
that
there
was
some
reason
for
the
question
and
answered
quite
readily
it
belonged
to
my
father
first
wife
barry
most
of
it
and
it
went
to
her
daughters
my
they
are
older
than
i
and
both
married
then
you
not
worth
eight
million
dollars
i
why
you
know
i
not
her
eyes
were
at
their
widest
who
ever
said
i
was
never
said
so
but
everyone
in
town
thinks
so
barry
great
sigh
of
relief
came
from
his
very
soul
sidney
pale
before
grew
very
red
she
freed
her
hands
and
sat
down
well
they
are
very
silly
then
she
said
almost
crossly
and
as
the
thought
expanded
she
added
but
i
do
see
how
anyone
could
they
must
have
thought
my
letting
them
help
me
out
with
the
flower
show
and
begging
for
the
old
paloma
girls
was
a
nice
piece
of
affectation
if
i
had
eight
million
dollars
or
one
million
do
you
suppose
i
be
doing
something
instead
of
puttering
away
with
just
the
beginning
of
things
the
annoyed
color
deepened
i
hope
you
mistaken
barry
said
she
why
did
you
set
them
right
i
why
i
thought
so
too
oh
barry
what
a
hypocrite
you
must
have
thought
me
she
buried
her
rosy
face
in
her
hand
for
a
moment
presently
she
rushed
on
half
indignantly
with
all
my
talk
about
the
sinfulness
of
american
women
who
persistently
attempt
a
scheme
of
living
that
is
far
beyond
their
incomes
and
talking
of
the
needs
of
the
poor
all
over
the
world
with
all
that
money
lying
idle
i
thought
of
it
chiefly
as
an
absolute
and
immovable
barrier
between
us
barry
said
honestly
and
that
was
as
far
as
my
thinking
went
her
eyes
met
his
with
that
curious
courage
she
had
when
a
difficult
moment
had
to
be
faced
there
is
a
more
serious
barrier
than
that
between
us
she
reminded
him
gravely
hetty
he
said
stupidly
but
i
told
you
but
he
stopped
short
realizing
that
he
had
not
yet
told
her
and
rather
at
a
loss
you
did
tell
me
anything
she
said
eyeing
him
steadily
why
barry
tone
was
much
lower
i
meant
to
tell
you
first
of
all
but
you
know
what
a
day
i
have
had
it
seems
impossible
that
i
only
left
san
francisco
this
morning
he
brought
his
chair
from
his
own
desk
and
sat
opposite
her
and
while
the
summer
twilight
outside
deepened
into
dusk
unmindful
of
time
he
went
over
the
pitiful
little
story
sidney
listened
her
serious
eyes
never
leaving
his
face
her
fine
hands
locked
idly
before
her
the
telephone
boy
and
the
movers
had
gone
now
and
there
was
silence
all
about
you
have
suffered
enough
barry
thank
god
it
is
all
over
she
said
at
the
end
and
we
know
she
went
on
with
one
of
her
rare
revelations
of
the
spiritual
deeps
that
lay
so
close
to
the
surface
of
her
life
we
know
that
she
is
safe
and
satisfied
at
last
in
his
care
for
a
moment
her
absent
eyes
seemed
to
fathom
far
spaces
barry
abruptly
broke
the
silence
for
one
year
sidney
he
said
in
a
purposeful
steady
voice
that
was
new
to
her
and
that
brought
her
eyes
almost
startled
to
his
face
for
one
year
i
going
to
show
you
what
i
can
do
in
that
time
the
mail
will
be
where
it
was
before
the
fire
if
all
goes
well
and
then
then
she
said
a
little
unsteadily
rising
and
gathering
hat
and
gloves
together
then
you
shall
come
to
me
and
tell
me
anything
you
like
but
but
not
now
all
this
is
so
new
and
so
strange
ah
but
sidney
he
pleaded
taking
her
hands
again
may
i
speak
of
it
just
this
one
day
and
then
never
again
let
me
think
for
this
whole
year
that
perhaps
you
will
marry
a
country
editor
and
that
we
shall
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
together
writing
and
planning
and
tramping
through
the
woods
and
picnicking
with
the
kiddies
on
the
river
and
giving
christmas
parties
for
every
little
and
in
old
paloma
but
you
do
want
to
settle
down
in
this
stupid
village
she
laughed
tremulously
tears
on
her
lashes
at
the
ugly
old
hall
and
among
these
superficial
women
just
here
he
said
smiling
at
his
own
words
in
the
sweetest
place
in
the
world
among
the
best
neighbors
i
never
want
to
go
anywhere
else
our
friends
are
here
our
work
is
here
and
we
are
here
she
finished
it
for
him
laughing
barry
with
a
great
rising
breath
put
his
arms
about
the
white
figure
and
crushed
her
to
him
and
sidney
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
raised
her
face
honestly
for
his
first
kiss
and
now
let
me
go
home
to
my
neglected
girls
she
said
after
an
interval
you
have
a
busy
night
ahead
of
you
and
your
press
boys
will
be
here
any
minute
but
first
she
took
a
sheet
of
yellow
copy
paper
and
wrote
on
it
one
year
of
silence
august
thirtieth
to
august
thirtieth
is
this
inclusive
she
asked
looking
up
exclusive
said
barry
firmly
exclusive
she
echoed
obediently
and
when
she
had
added
the
word
she
folded
the
sheet
and
gave
it
to
barry
there
is
a
little
reminder
for
you
said
she
barry
went
down
to
the
street
door
with
her
to
watch
her
start
homeward
in
the
sweet
summer
darkness
oh
one
more
thing
i
meant
to
say
she
said
as
they
stood
on
the
platform
of
what
had
been
the
old
station
i
do
know
why
i
said
it
already
or
why
you
have
and
that
is
madam
he
asked
attentively
it
just
this
she
swayed
a
little
nearer
to
him
her
laughing
voice
was
no
more
than
a
whisper
i
love
you
barry
have
i
said
that
he
asked
a
little
hoarsely
not
yet
then
i
say
it
he
answered
steadily
i
love
you
my
darling
oh
not
here
barry
in
the
street
was
burgoyne
next
remark
but
there
was
no
moon
and
no
witnesses
but
the
blank
walls
and
shuttered
windows
of
neighboring
storehouses
and
the
silent
year
had
not
after
all
fairly
begun
