scientists
of
rykeman
iii
were
conceded
by
all
the
galactic
members
to
be
supreme
in
scientific
achievement
now
the
rykes
were
going
to
share
their
vast
knowledge
with
the
scientists
of
earth
to
any
question
they
would
supply
an
answer
for
a
price
and
hockley
of
all
earth
scientists
was
the
stubborn
one
who
wanted
to
weigh
the
answers
with
the
costs
the
chief
officer
of
scientific
services
information
and
coordination
was
a
somewhat
misleading
and
obscure
title
and
sherman
hockley
who
held
it
was
not
the
least
of
those
whom
the
title
misled
and
sometimes
obscured
he
told
himself
he
was
not
a
mere
library
administrator
although
he
was
proud
of
the
information
files
built
up
under
his
direction
they
contained
the
essence
of
accumulated
knowledge
found
to
date
on
earth
and
the
extraterrestrial
planets
so
far
contacted
he
did
feel
justified
in
claiming
to
be
strictly
a
research
supervisor
either
in
spite
of
duties
as
top
level
administrator
for
all
divisions
of
the
national
standardization
and
research
laboratories
and
their
subsidiaries
in
government
industry
and
education
during
his
term
of
supervision
the
national
laboratories
had
made
a
tremendous
growth
in
contrast
to
a
previous
decline
most
of
all
however
he
disclaimed
being
a
figurehead
to
which
all
the
loose
strings
of
a
vast
and
rambling
organization
could
be
tied
but
sometimes
it
was
quite
difficult
to
know
whether
or
not
that
was
his
primary
assignment
after
all
his
unrelenting
efforts
to
keep
out
of
the
category
seemed
to
be
encountering
more
and
more
determination
to
push
him
in
that
direction
of
course
this
was
merely
the
way
it
looked
in
his
more
bitter
moments
such
as
the
present
normally
he
had
a
full
awareness
of
the
paramount
importance
of
his
position
and
was
determined
to
administer
it
on
a
scale
in
keeping
with
that
importance
his
decision
could
affect
the
research
in
the
world
major
laboratories
not
that
he
was
a
dictator
by
any
means
although
there
were
times
when
dictation
was
called
for
as
when
a
dozen
projects
needed
money
and
the
congress
allotted
enough
for
one
or
two
somebody
had
to
make
a
choice
his
major
difficulty
was
that
active
researchers
knew
it
was
the
congressional
science
committee
which
was
ultimately
responsible
for
their
bread
and
butter
and
the
senators
regarded
the
scientists
who
did
the
actual
work
in
the
laboratories
as
the
only
ones
who
mattered
both
groups
tended
to
look
upon
hockley
office
as
a
sort
of
fulcrum
in
their
efforts
to
maintain
balance
with
each
other
or
as
referee
in
their
sparring
for
adequate
control
over
each
other
at
that
however
things
were
better
than
ever
before
more
funds
and
facilities
were
available
positions
in
pure
research
were
more
secure
and
then
once
again
rumors
about
rykeman
iii
had
begun
to
circulate
wildly
a
few
days
ago
since
man
achievement
of
flight
stories
of
rykeman
iii
had
tantalized
the
world
and
made
research
scientists
sick
with
longing
when
they
considered
the
possible
truth
of
what
they
heard
the
planet
was
rumored
to
be
a
world
of
whose
people
had
an
answer
for
every
research
problem
a
man
could
conceive
the
very
few
earthmen
who
had
been
to
rykeman
iii
confirmed
the
rumors
it
was
a
paradise
according
to
their
stories
and
among
other
peoples
of
the
galaxies
the
inhabitants
of
rykeman
iii
were
acknowledged
supreme
in
scientific
achievement
none
challenged
them
none
even
approached
them
in
abilities
what
made
the
situation
so
frustrating
to
earthmen
was
the
additional
report
that
the
rykes
were
quite
altruistically
sharing
their
science
with
a
considerable
number
of
other
worlds
on
a
fee
basis
earth
scientists
became
intoxicated
at
the
mere
thought
of
studying
at
the
feet
of
the
exalted
rykes
except
sherman
hockley
from
the
first
he
had
taken
a
dim
view
of
the
ryke
reports
considering
the
accomplishments
of
the
national
laboratories
he
could
see
no
reason
for
his
colleagues
disowning
of
all
their
own
work
in
favor
of
a
completely
unknown
culture
several
hundred
million
light
years
away
they
were
bound
to
contact
more
advanced
cultures
in
their
explorations
and
could
be
thankful
they
were
as
altruistic
as
the
rykes
but
it
was
no
reason
to
view
themselves
as
idiot
children
hoping
to
be
taught
by
the
rykes
he
had
kept
his
opinions
very
much
to
himself
in
the
past
since
they
were
not
popular
with
his
associates
who
generally
regarded
his
attitudes
as
simply
but
now
for
the
first
time
a
ryke
ship
was
honoring
earth
with
a
visit
there
was
almost
hysterical
speculation
over
the
possibility
that
earth
would
be
offered
tutelage
by
the
mighty
ryke
scientists
hockley
would
have
said
he
was
unalterably
opposed
to
the
idea
he
would
have
described
himself
as
extremely
cautious
what
he
did
oppose
wholeheartedly
was
the
enthusiasm
that
painted
the
rykes
with
pure
and
shining
light
without
a
shadowy
hue
in
the
whole
picture
since
his
arrival
the
ryke
envoy
had
been
closeted
with
members
of
the
congressional
science
committee
not
a
word
had
leaked
as
to
his
message
shortly
however
the
scientists
were
to
be
let
in
on
the
secret
which
might
affect
their
careers
for
better
or
for
worse
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
for
many
generations
to
come
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
hockley
jumped
to
his
feet
as
he
glanced
at
the
clock
he
hurried
through
the
door
to
the
office
of
his
secretary
miss
cardston
who
looked
meaningfully
at
him
as
he
passed
i
bet
there
is
a
senator
on
time
he
said
in
the
corridor
he
almost
collided
with
lester
showalter
who
was
his
administrative
assistant
for
basic
research
the
ryke
character
showed
up
fifteen
minutes
ago
said
showalter
everyone
waiting
we
got
six
minutes
yet
said
hockley
he
walked
rapidly
beside
showalter
is
there
any
word
on
what
the
envoy
got
that
so
important
no
i
got
the
feeling
it
something
pretty
big
wheeler
and
johnson
of
budget
are
there
somebody
said
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
national
lab
i
do
see
the
connection
between
that
and
a
meeting
with
the
ryke
said
hockley
showalter
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
conference
room
maybe
they
want
to
sell
us
something
at
any
rate
we
about
to
find
out
the
conference
table
was
surrounded
by
senators
of
the
committee
layered
behind
them
were
scientists
representing
the
cream
of
organization
senator
markham
the
bulky
chairman
greeted
them
your
seats
are
reserved
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
said
sorry
about
the
time
hockley
mumbled
clock
must
be
slow
quite
all
right
we
assembled
just
a
trifle
early
i
want
you
to
meet
our
visitor
special
envoy
from
rykeman
iii
liacan
markham
introduced
them
and
the
envoy
arose
with
an
extended
hand
his
frail
whistling
voice
that
was
in
keeping
with
his
character
spoke
in
clear
tones
i
am
happy
to
know
you
hockley
dr
showalter
the
two
men
sat
down
in
good
view
of
the
visitor
profile
hockley
had
seen
the
rykes
before
but
had
always
been
repelled
by
their
snobbish
approach
characteristically
the
envoy
bore
roughly
anthropomorphic
features
including
a
short
feather
covering
on
his
dorsal
side
he
was
dressed
in
bright
clothing
that
left
visible
the
streak
of
feathering
that
descended
from
the
bright
plumed
crown
and
along
the
back
of
his
neck
gravity
and
air
pressure
of
earth
were
about
normal
for
him
for
breathing
however
he
was
required
to
wear
a
small
device
in
one
narrow
nostril
this
was
connected
to
a
compact
tank
on
his
shoulder
markham
called
for
order
and
introduced
the
visitor
there
was
a
round
of
applause
liacan
bowed
with
a
short
stiff
gesture
and
let
his
small
black
eyes
dart
over
the
audience
with
an
adjustment
of
his
breathing
piece
he
began
speaking
it
is
recognized
on
earth
he
said
as
it
is
elsewhere
that
my
people
of
rykeman
iii
possess
undisputed
intellectual
leadership
in
the
galaxies
of
the
council
your
research
is
concerned
with
things
taught
only
in
the
kindergartens
of
my
world
much
that
you
hold
to
be
true
is
in
error
and
your
most
profound
discoveries
are
to
the
children
of
my
people
hockley
felt
a
quick
painful
contraction
in
the
region
of
his
diaphragm
so
this
was
it
we
are
regarded
with
much
jealousy
envy
and
even
hatred
by
some
of
our
unlearned
neighbors
in
space
said
the
ryke
but
it
has
never
been
our
desire
to
be
selfish
with
our
superior
achievements
which
make
us
the
object
of
these
feelings
we
have
undertaken
a
program
of
scientific
leadership
in
our
interstellar
neighborhood
this
began
long
before
you
came
into
space
and
many
worlds
have
accepted
the
plan
we
offer
obviously
it
is
impractical
to
pour
out
all
the
knowledge
and
basic
science
we
have
accumulated
another
world
would
find
it
impossible
to
sort
out
that
which
was
applicable
to
it
what
we
do
is
act
as
a
consultation
center
upon
which
others
can
call
at
will
to
obtain
data
pertaining
to
any
problem
at
hand
thus
they
are
not
required
to
sort
through
wholly
inapplicable
information
to
find
what
they
need
for
example
if
you
desire
to
improve
your
surface
conveyances
we
will
supply
you
with
data
for
building
an
optimum
vehicle
suitable
for
conditions
on
earth
and
which
is
virtually
indestructible
you
will
of
course
do
your
own
manufacturing
but
even
there
we
can
supply
you
with
technology
that
will
make
the
process
seem
miraculous
by
your
present
standards
our
services
are
offered
for
a
fee
payable
in
suitable
items
of
goods
or
raw
materials
when
you
contemplate
the
freedom
from
monotonous
and
unending
research
in
fields
already
explored
by
us
i
am
certain
you
will
not
consider
our
fees
exorbitant
our
desire
is
to
raise
the
cultural
level
of
all
peoples
to
the
maximum
of
which
they
are
capable
we
know
it
is
not
possible
or
even
desirable
to
bring
others
to
our
own
high
levels
but
we
do
offer
assistance
to
all
cultures
in
accord
with
their
ability
to
receive
the
basic
principle
is
that
they
shall
ask
and
whatever
is
asked
for
with
intelligence
sufficient
for
its
utilization
that
shall
be
granted
i
am
certain
i
may
count
on
your
acceptance
of
the
generous
offer
of
my
people
the
envoy
sat
down
with
a
jiggling
of
his
bright
plume
and
there
was
absolute
silence
in
the
room
hockley
pictured
to
himself
the
dusty
cobweb
laboratories
of
earth
vacated
by
scientists
who
ran
to
the
phone
to
call
the
rykes
for
answers
to
every
problem
senator
markham
stood
up
and
glanced
over
the
audience
there
is
the
essence
of
the
program
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
he
said
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
detail
which
is
of
course
obvious
to
the
minds
of
our
friends
on
rykeman
iii
but
which
must
be
the
subject
of
much
deliberation
on
the
part
of
us
comparatively
simple
minded
earthmen
he
gave
a
chuckle
which
got
no
response
hockley
felt
mentally
stunned
here
at
last
was
the
thing
that
had
been
hoped
for
by
most
anxiously
awaited
by
a
few
and
opposed
by
almost
no
one
the
major
difficulty
said
markham
with
slow
dignity
is
the
price
it
high
yes
in
monetary
terms
approximately
twelve
and
a
half
billions
per
year
but
certainly
no
man
in
his
right
mind
would
consider
any
reasonable
figure
too
high
for
what
we
can
expect
to
receive
from
our
friends
of
rykeman
iii
we
of
the
science
committee
do
not
believe
however
that
we
could
get
a
commitment
for
this
sum
to
be
added
to
our
normal
budget
yet
there
is
a
rather
obvious
solution
the
sum
required
is
very
close
to
that
which
is
now
expended
on
the
national
standardization
and
research
laboratories
hockley
felt
a
sudden
chill
at
the
back
of
his
neck
with
the
assistance
of
the
rykes
said
markham
we
shall
have
no
further
need
of
the
national
laboratories
we
shall
require
but
a
small
staff
to
analyze
our
problems
and
present
them
to
the
rykes
and
relay
the
answers
for
proper
assimilation
acceptance
of
the
ryke
program
provides
its
own
automatic
financing
he
glanced
about
with
a
triumphant
smile
hockley
felt
as
if
he
were
looking
through
a
mist
upon
something
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
the
national
lab
abandon
the
national
lab
around
him
there
were
small
nods
of
agreement
from
his
colleagues
some
pursed
their
lips
as
if
doubtful
but
not
very
much
he
waited
for
someone
to
rise
to
his
feet
in
a
blast
of
protest
no
one
did
for
a
moment
hockley
own
hands
tensed
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
front
of
him
then
he
slumped
back
to
his
seat
now
was
not
the
time
they
had
to
thrash
it
out
among
themselves
he
had
to
show
them
the
magnitude
of
this
bribe
he
had
to
find
an
argument
to
beat
down
the
congressmen
irrational
hopes
of
paradise
he
could
plead
for
the
lab
on
the
grounds
of
sentiment
or
that
it
was
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
work
out
your
own
problems
the
senators
did
care
for
the
problems
or
concerns
of
the
scientists
it
appeared
that
even
the
scientists
themselves
had
forgotten
to
care
he
had
to
slug
both
groups
with
something
very
solid
markham
was
going
on
we
are
convinced
this
is
a
bargain
which
even
the
most
obstinate
of
our
congressional
colleagues
will
be
quick
to
recognize
it
would
be
folly
to
compute
with
building
blocks
when
we
can
gain
access
to
giant
calculators
there
should
be
no
real
difficulty
in
getting
funds
transferred
from
the
national
laboratory
at
this
time
we
will
adjourn
liacan
leaves
this
evening
our
acceptance
of
this
generous
offer
will
be
conveyed
to
rykeman
iii
directly
upon
official
sanction
by
the
congress
i
wish
to
ask
this
same
group
to
meet
again
for
discussion
of
the
details
incident
to
this
transfer
of
operations
let
us
say
at
ten
in
the
morning
gentlemen
hockley
said
goodbye
to
the
envoy
afterwards
he
moved
through
the
circle
of
senators
to
his
own
group
in
the
corridor
they
tightened
about
him
and
followed
along
as
if
he
had
given
an
order
for
them
to
follow
him
he
turned
and
attempted
a
grin
looks
like
a
bull
session
is
in
order
gents
assembly
in
five
minutes
in
my
office
as
he
and
showalter
opened
the
door
to
miss
cardston
office
and
strode
in
the
secretary
looked
up
with
a
start
i
thought
you
were
going
to
meet
in
the
conference
room
we
met
said
hockley
this
is
the
aftermeeting
send
out
for
a
couple
of
cases
of
beer
he
glanced
at
the
number
surging
through
the
doorway
and
fished
in
his
billfold
better
make
it
three
this
ought
to
cover
it
with
disapproval
miss
cardston
picked
up
the
bills
and
turned
to
the
phone
almost
simultaneously
there
was
a
bellow
of
protest
and
an
enormous
hand
gripped
her
slender
wrist
she
glanced
up
in
momentary
fright
forman
silvers
was
holding
her
wrist
with
one
hand
and
clapping
hockley
on
the
back
with
the
other
this
is
not
an
occasion
for
beer
my
boy
he
said
in
an
enormous
voice
make
that
a
case
of
champagne
miss
cardston
he
released
her
and
drew
out
his
own
billfold
get
somebody
to
bring
in
a
couple
of
dozen
chairs
hockley
said
in
his
own
office
he
walked
to
the
window
behind
his
desk
and
stood
facing
it
the
afternoon
haze
was
coming
up
out
of
the
ocean
faintly
visible
were
the
great
buildings
of
the
national
laboratories
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
above
the
mist
the
sun
caught
the
tip
of
the
eight
story
tower
where
the
massive
field
tunnels
of
the
newly
designed
gammatron
were
to
be
installed
or
to
have
been
installed
the
gammatron
was
expected
to
make
possible
the
creation
of
gravitational
fields
up
to
five
thousand
g
it
would
probably
be
a
mere
toy
to
the
rykes
but
hockley
felt
a
fierce
pride
in
its
creation
maybe
that
was
childish
maybe
his
whole
feeling
about
the
lab
was
childish
perhaps
the
time
had
come
to
give
up
childish
things
and
take
upon
themselves
adulthood
but
looking
across
the
city
at
the
concrete
spire
of
the
gammatron
he
did
believe
it
he
heard
the
clank
of
metal
chairs
as
a
couple
of
clerks
began
bringing
them
in
then
there
was
the
clink
of
glassware
he
turned
to
see
miss
cardston
stiffly
indicating
a
spot
on
the
library
table
for
the
glasses
and
the
frosty
bottles
hockley
walked
slowly
to
the
table
and
filled
one
of
the
glasses
he
raised
it
slowly
it
been
a
short
life
but
a
merry
one
gentlemen
he
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
glass
too
quickly
and
returned
to
his
desk
you
do
sound
very
happy
about
the
whole
thing
said
mortenson
a
chemist
who
wore
a
neat
silvery
mustache
are
you
overjoyed
said
hockley
that
we
are
to
swap
the
national
lab
for
a
bottomless
encyclopedia
yes
i
think
so
said
mortenson
there
are
some
minor
objections
but
in
the
end
i
certain
we
all
be
satisfied
with
what
we
get
satisfied
happy
exclaimed
the
mathematician
silvers
how
can
you
use
words
so
prosaic
and
restrained
in
references
to
these
great
events
which
we
shall
be
privileged
to
witness
in
our
lifetimes
he
had
taken
his
stand
by
the
library
table
and
was
now
filling
the
glasses
with
the
clear
bubbling
champagne
sloshing
it
with
ecstatic
abandon
over
the
table
and
the
rug
hockley
glanced
toward
him
you
do
believe
then
silvers
that
we
should
maintain
any
reserve
in
regard
to
the
rykes
none
whatever
the
gods
themselves
have
stepped
down
and
offered
an
invitation
direct
to
paradise
should
we
question
or
hold
back
or
say
we
are
merely
happy
the
proper
response
of
a
man
about
to
enter
heaven
is
beyond
words
the
bombast
of
the
mathematician
never
failed
to
enliven
any
backroom
session
in
which
he
participated
i
have
no
doubt
he
said
that
within
a
fortnight
we
shall
be
in
possession
of
a
solution
to
the
legrandian
equations
i
have
sought
this
for
forty
years
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
support
the
closing
of
the
national
laboratories
said
hockley
slowly
as
if
a
switch
had
been
thrown
their
expressions
changed
there
was
a
sudden
carefulness
in
their
stance
and
movements
as
if
they
were
feinting
before
a
deadly
opponent
i
do
feel
it
such
a
bad
bargain
said
a
thin
bespectacled
physicist
named
judson
he
was
seated
across
the
room
from
hockley
i
vote
to
sacrifice
the
lab
in
exchange
for
what
the
rykes
will
give
us
that
the
point
said
hockley
exactly
what
are
the
rykes
going
to
give
us
and
we
speak
very
glibly
of
sharing
their
science
but
shall
we
actually
be
in
any
position
to
share
it
what
becomes
of
the
class
of
scientists
on
earth
when
the
lab
is
abandoned
wilkins
stood
abruptly
his
hands
shoved
part
way
into
his
pockets
and
his
lower
jaw
extended
tensely
i
do
believe
that
part
of
this
question
he
said
it
is
not
just
we
scientists
who
are
to
share
the
benefits
of
the
rykes
it
is
mankind
at
this
time
we
have
no
right
to
consider
mere
personal
concerns
we
would
betray
our
whole
calling
our
very
humanity
if
we
thought
for
one
moment
of
standing
in
the
way
of
this
development
because
of
our
personal
concern
over
economic
and
professional
problems
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
a
true
scientist
would
not
put
aside
his
personal
concerns
for
the
good
of
all
hockley
waited
half
expecting
somebody
to
start
clapping
no
one
did
but
there
were
glances
of
approval
in
wilkins
direction
the
biologist
straightened
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
with
a
smug
gesture
and
awaited
hockley
rebuttal
are
mankind
hockley
said
finally
you
and
i
are
as
much
a
part
of
humanity
as
that
bus
load
of
punch
machine
clerks
and
store
managers
passing
on
the
street
outside
if
we
betray
ourselves
we
have
betrayed
humanity
this
is
not
a
sudden
thing
it
is
the
end
point
of
a
trend
which
has
gone
on
for
a
long
time
it
began
with
our
first
contacts
beyond
the
galaxy
when
we
realized
there
were
peoples
far
in
advance
of
us
in
science
and
economy
we
have
been
feeding
on
them
ever
since
our
own
developments
have
shrunk
in
direct
proportion
for
a
long
time
been
on
the
verge
of
becoming
intellectual
parasites
in
the
universe
acceptance
of
the
ryke
offer
will
be
the
final
step
in
that
direction
instantly
almost
every
other
man
in
the
room
was
talking
at
once
hockley
smiled
faintly
until
the
angry
voices
subsided
then
silvers
cleared
his
throat
gently
he
placed
his
glass
beside
the
bottles
on
the
table
with
a
precise
motion
i
am
sure
he
said
that
a
thought
will
convince
you
that
you
do
not
mean
what
you
have
just
said
consider
the
position
of
pupil
and
teacher
one
of
man
greatest
failings
is
his
predilection
for
assuming
always
the
position
of
teacher
and
eschewing
that
of
pupil
there
is
also
the
question
of
humility
intellectual
humility
we
scientists
have
always
boasted
of
our
readiness
to
set
aside
one
truth
and
accept
another
with
more
valid
supporting
evidence
since
our
first
contact
with
other
galactic
civilizations
we
have
had
the
utmost
need
to
adopt
an
attitude
of
humility
we
have
been
fortunate
in
coming
to
a
community
of
worlds
where
war
and
oppression
are
not
standard
rules
of
procedure
among
our
own
people
we
have
encountered
no
such
magnanimity
as
has
been
extended
repeatedly
by
other
worlds
climaxed
now
by
the
ryke
magnificent
offer
to
adopt
sincere
intellectual
humility
and
the
attitude
of
the
pupil
is
not
to
function
as
a
parasite
dr
hockley
your
analogy
of
teacher
and
pupil
is
very
faulty
in
expressing
our
relation
to
the
rykes
said
hockley
or
perhaps
i
should
say
it
is
too
hellishly
accurate
would
you
have
us
remain
the
eternal
pupils
the
closing
of
the
national
laboratories
means
an
irreversible
change
in
our
position
is
it
worth
gaining
a
universe
of
knowledge
to
give
up
your
own
personal
free
inquiry
i
am
sure
none
of
us
considers
he
is
giving
up
his
personal
free
inquiry
said
silvers
almost
angrily
we
see
unlimited
expansion
beyond
anything
we
have
imagined
in
our
wildest
dreams
on
a
few
faces
there
were
frowns
of
uncertainty
but
no
one
spoke
up
to
support
him
hockley
knew
that
until
this
vision
of
paradise
wore
off
there
were
none
of
them
on
whom
he
could
count
he
smiled
broadly
and
stood
up
to
ease
the
tension
in
the
room
well
it
appears
you
have
made
your
decision
of
course
congress
can
accept
the
ryke
plan
whether
we
approve
or
not
but
it
is
good
to
go
on
record
one
way
or
the
other
i
suppose
that
on
the
way
out
tonight
it
would
be
proper
to
check
in
at
personnel
and
file
a
services
available
notification
and
then
he
wished
he
had
said
that
their
faces
grew
a
little
more
set
at
his
unappreciated
attempt
at
humor
showalter
remained
after
the
others
left
he
sat
across
the
desk
while
hockley
turned
back
to
the
window
only
the
tip
of
the
gammatron
tower
now
caught
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
maybe
i
getting
old
hockley
said
maybe
they
right
and
the
lab
is
worth
preserving
if
it
means
the
difference
between
getting
or
not
getting
tutelage
from
the
rykes
but
you
do
feel
that
true
said
showalter
no
you
the
one
who
built
the
lab
into
what
it
is
it
has
as
much
worth
as
it
ever
had
and
you
have
an
obligation
to
keep
it
from
being
destroyed
by
a
group
of
politicians
who
could
never
understand
its
necessity
i
did
build
it
said
hockley
it
grew
because
i
was
able
to
find
enough
people
who
wanted
the
institution
to
exist
but
i
been
away
from
research
so
long
i
never
was
much
good
at
it
really
did
you
ever
know
that
i
always
thought
of
myself
as
a
sort
of
impressario
of
scientific
productions
if
i
might
use
such
a
term
maybe
those
closer
to
the
actual
work
are
right
maybe
i
just
trying
to
hang
on
to
the
past
it
could
be
time
for
a
jump
to
a
new
kind
of
progress
you
do
believe
any
of
that
hockley
looked
steadily
in
the
direction
of
the
lab
buildings
i
believe
any
of
it
that
is
just
an
accumulation
of
buildings
over
there
with
a
name
attached
to
them
it
the
advancing
terminal
of
all
man
history
of
trying
to
find
out
about
himself
and
the
universe
it
started
before
neanderthal
climbed
into
his
caves
a
half
million
years
ago
from
then
until
now
there
a
steady
path
of
trial
and
error
of
learning
there
exultation
and
despair
success
and
failure
now
they
want
to
say
it
was
all
for
nothing
but
to
be
pupils
to
let
the
rykes
teach
us
the
only
trouble
with
silvers
argument
is
that
our
culture
has
never
understood
that
teaching
in
the
accepted
sense
is
an
impossibility
there
can
be
only
learning
never
teaching
the
teacher
has
to
be
eliminated
from
the
actual
learning
process
before
genuine
learning
can
ever
take
place
but
the
rykes
offer
to
become
the
ultimate
teacher
and
if
this
is
true
said
showalter
slowly
you
could
teach
it
to
those
who
disagree
could
you
they
have
to
learn
it
for
themselves
hockley
turned
for
a
moment
he
continued
to
stare
at
his
assistant
then
his
face
broke
into
a
narrow
grin
of
course
you
right
only
one
way
they
ever
learn
it
go
through
the
actual
experience
of
what
ryke
tutelage
will
mean
most
of
the
workrooms
at
information
central
were
empty
this
time
of
evening
hockley
selected
the
first
one
he
came
to
and
called
for
every
scrap
of
data
pertaining
to
rykeman
iii
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
information
available
on
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
world
hockley
scribbled
swift
privately
intelligible
notes
as
he
scanned
the
rykes
lived
under
a
gravity
one
third
heavier
than
earth
with
a
day
little
more
than
half
as
long
and
they
received
only
forty
percent
as
much
heat
from
their
frail
sun
as
earthmen
were
accustomed
to
cultural
characteristics
included
a
trading
system
that
made
the
entire
planet
a
single
economic
unit
and
the
planet
had
no
history
whatever
of
war
the
rykes
themselves
had
contributed
almost
nothing
to
the
central
libraries
of
the
galaxies
concerning
their
own
personal
makeup
and
mental
functions
however
what
little
was
available
came
from
observers
not
of
their
race
there
were
indications
they
were
a
highly
unemotional
race
not
given
to
any
artistic
expression
hockley
found
this
surprising
the
general
rule
was
for
highly
intellectual
attainments
to
be
accompanied
by
equally
high
artistic
expression
but
all
of
this
provided
no
data
that
he
could
relate
to
his
present
problem
no
basis
for
argument
beyond
what
he
already
had
he
returned
the
films
to
their
silver
cans
and
sat
staring
at
the
neat
pile
of
them
on
the
desk
then
he
smiled
at
his
own
obtuseness
data
on
rykeman
iii
might
be
lacking
but
the
ryke
plan
had
been
tried
on
plenty
of
other
worlds
data
on
should
not
be
so
scarce
he
returned
the
cans
and
punched
out
a
new
request
on
the
call
panel
twenty
seconds
later
he
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
score
of
new
tapes
in
the
hopper
that
was
enough
for
a
full
night
work
he
wished
brought
showalter
along
to
help
then
his
eye
caught
sight
of
the
label
on
the
topmost
can
in
the
pile
janisson
viii
the
name
rang
a
familiar
signal
somewhere
deep
in
his
mind
then
he
knew
that
was
the
home
world
of
waldon
thar
one
of
his
closest
friends
in
the
year
when
he
gone
to
school
at
galactic
center
for
advanced
study
thar
had
been
one
of
the
most
brilliant
researchers
hockley
had
ever
known
in
bull
session
debate
he
was
instantly
beyond
the
depth
of
everyone
else
janisson
viii
thar
could
tell
him
about
the
rykes
hockley
pushed
the
tape
cans
aside
and
went
to
the
phone
in
the
workroom
he
dialed
for
the
interstellar
operator
government
priority
call
to
janisson
viii
he
said
waldon
thar
he
attended
galactic
center
research
institute
years
ago
he
came
from
the
city
plar
which
was
his
home
at
that
time
i
have
no
other
information
except
that
he
is
probably
employed
as
a
research
scientist
there
was
a
moment
silence
while
the
operator
noted
the
information
there
will
be
some
delay
she
said
finally
at
present
the
beams
are
full
i
can
use
top
emergency
priority
on
this
said
hockley
can
you
clear
a
trunk
for
me
on
that
yes
one
moment
please
he
sat
by
the
window
for
half
an
hour
turning
down
the
light
in
the
workroom
so
that
he
could
see
the
flow
of
traffic
at
the
port
west
of
the
lab
buildings
two
spaceships
took
off
and
three
came
in
while
he
waited
and
then
the
phone
rang
i
sorry
the
operator
said
waldon
thar
is
reported
not
on
janisson
viii
he
went
to
rykeman
iii
about
two
earth
years
ago
do
you
wish
to
attempt
to
locate
him
there
by
all
means
said
hockley
same
priority
this
was
better
than
he
had
hoped
for
thar
could
really
get
him
the
information
he
needed
on
the
rykes
twenty
minutes
later
the
phone
rang
again
in
the
operator
first
words
hockley
sensed
apology
and
knew
the
attempt
had
failed
our
office
has
learned
that
waldon
thar
is
at
present
on
tour
as
aide
to
the
ryke
emissary
liacan
we
can
perhaps
trace
no
hockley
shouted
that
wo
be
necessary
i
know
now
he
almost
laughed
aloud
to
himself
this
was
an
incredible
piece
of
good
luck
waldon
thar
was
probably
out
at
the
space
port
right
now
unless
one
of
those
ships
taking
off
had
been
the
ryke
he
wondered
why
thar
had
not
tried
to
contact
him
of
course
it
had
been
a
long
time
but
they
had
been
very
close
at
the
center
he
dialed
the
field
control
tower
i
want
to
know
if
the
ship
from
rykeman
iii
has
departed
yet
he
said
they
were
scheduled
for
six
hours
ago
but
mechanical
difficulty
has
delayed
them
present
estimated
is
almost
two
hours
to
go
hockley
thought
that
should
be
time
enough
please
put
me
in
communication
with
one
of
the
aides
aboard
named
waldon
thar
this
is
sherman
hockley
of
scientific
services
priority
request
i
try
sir
the
tower
operator
manifested
a
sudden
increase
of
respect
one
moment
please
hockley
heard
the
buzz
and
switch
clicks
of
communication
circuits
reaching
for
the
ship
then
in
a
moment
he
heard
the
somewhat
irritated
but
familiar
voice
of
his
old
friend
waldon
thar
speaking
the
voice
said
who
wishes
to
talk
listen
you
old
son
of
a
cyclotron
maiden
aunt
said
hockley
who
would
want
to
talk
on
sol
iii
why
did
you
give
me
a
buzz
when
you
landed
i
just
found
out
you
were
here
sherm
hockley
of
course
the
voice
said
with
distant
unperturbed
tones
this
is
indeed
a
surprise
and
a
pleasure
to
be
honest
i
had
forgotten
earth
was
your
home
planet
i
try
to
think
of
something
to
jog
your
memory
next
time
how
about
getting
together
well
i
do
have
very
long
said
thar
hesitantly
if
you
could
come
over
for
a
few
minutes
hockley
had
the
jolting
feeling
that
waldon
thar
would
just
as
soon
pass
up
the
opportunity
for
their
meeting
some
of
the
enthusiasm
went
out
of
his
voice
there
a
good
eatery
and
bar
on
the
field
there
i
be
along
in
fifteen
minutes
fine
said
thar
but
please
try
not
to
be
late
on
the
way
to
the
field
hockley
wondered
about
the
change
that
had
apparently
taken
place
in
thar
of
course
had
changed
too
perhaps
for
much
the
worse
but
thar
sounded
like
a
stuffed
shirt
now
and
that
is
the
last
thing
hockley
would
have
expected
in
school
thar
had
been
the
most
irreverent
of
the
whole
class
of
irreverents
denouncing
in
ecstasy
the
established
and
unproven
lore
riding
the
professors
of
unsubstantiated
hypotheses
now
well
he
did
sound
like
the
thar
hockley
knew
he
took
a
table
and
sat
down
just
as
thar
entered
the
dining
room
the
latter
broad
smile
momentarily
removed
hockley
doubts
the
smile
had
changed
and
there
was
the
same
expression
of
devilish
disregard
for
the
established
order
the
same
warm
friendliness
it
baffled
hockley
to
understand
how
thar
could
have
failed
to
remember
earth
was
his
home
thar
mentioned
it
as
he
came
up
and
took
hockley
hand
i
terribly
sorry
he
said
it
was
stupid
to
forget
that
earth
meant
sherman
hockley
i
know
how
it
is
i
should
have
written
i
guess
i
the
one
who
owes
a
letter
no
i
think
not
said
thar
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
a
small
table
near
a
window
and
ordered
drinks
on
the
field
they
could
see
the
vast
shadowy
outline
of
the
ryke
vessel
thar
was
of
a
race
genetically
close
to
the
rykes
he
lacked
the
feathery
covering
but
this
was
replaced
by
a
layer
of
thin
scales
which
had
a
tendency
to
stand
on
edge
when
he
was
excited
he
also
wore
a
breathing
piece
and
carried
the
small
shoulder
tank
with
a
faint
air
of
superiority
hockley
watched
him
with
a
growing
sense
of
loss
the
first
impression
had
been
more
nearly
correct
thar
had
wanted
to
meet
him
it
been
a
long
time
said
hockley
lamely
i
guess
there
is
much
we
did
back
there
that
means
anything
now
you
should
say
that
said
thar
as
if
recognizing
he
had
been
too
remote
every
hour
of
our
acquaintance
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
never
forgive
myself
for
forgetting
but
tell
me
how
you
learned
i
was
aboard
the
ryke
ship
the
rykes
have
made
us
an
offer
i
wanted
to
find
out
the
effects
on
worlds
that
had
accepted
i
learned
janisson
viii
was
one
so
i
started
looking
i
so
very
glad
you
did
sherm
you
want
me
to
confirm
of
course
the
advisability
of
accepting
the
offer
liacan
has
made
confirm
or
deny
it
said
hockley
thar
spread
his
clawlike
hands
deny
it
the
most
glorious
opportunity
a
planet
could
possibly
have
something
in
thar
voice
gave
hockley
a
sudden
chill
how
has
it
worked
on
your
own
world
janisson
viii
has
turned
from
a
slum
to
a
world
of
mansions
our
economic
problems
have
been
solved
health
and
long
life
are
routine
there
is
nothing
we
want
that
we
can
not
have
for
the
asking
but
are
you
with
it
is
there
nothing
which
you
had
to
give
up
that
you
would
like
returned
waldon
thar
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
in
high
pitched
tones
i
might
have
known
that
would
be
the
question
you
would
ask
forgive
me
friend
sherman
but
i
had
almost
forgotten
how
unventuresome
you
are
your
question
is
ridiculous
why
should
we
wish
to
go
back
to
our
economic
inequalities
poverty
and
distress
our
ignorant
plodding
research
in
science
you
can
answer
your
own
question
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
hockley
thought
his
friend
would
have
gladly
terminated
their
visit
right
there
and
returned
to
his
ship
to
forestall
this
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
asked
your
science
what
has
become
of
that
our
science
we
never
had
any
we
were
ignorant
children
playing
with
mud
and
rocks
we
knew
nothing
we
had
nothing
until
the
rykes
offered
to
educate
us
surely
you
do
believe
that
said
hockley
quietly
the
problem
you
worked
on
at
the
institute
gravity
at
levels
that
was
not
a
childish
thing
thar
laughed
shortly
and
bitterly
what
disillusionment
you
have
coming
friend
sherman
if
you
only
knew
how
truly
childish
it
was
wait
until
you
learn
from
the
rykes
the
true
conception
of
gravity
its
nature
and
the
part
it
plays
in
the
structure
of
matter
hockley
felt
a
sick
tightening
within
him
this
was
not
the
waldon
thar
the
wild
demon
who
thrust
aside
all
authority
and
rumor
in
his
own
headlong
search
for
knowledge
it
could
be
thar
who
was
sitting
passively
by
being
what
the
nature
of
the
universe
is
your
scientists
hockley
persisted
what
has
become
of
all
your
researchers
the
answer
is
the
same
said
thar
we
had
no
science
we
had
no
scientists
those
who
once
went
by
that
name
have
become
for
the
first
time
honest
students
knowing
the
pleasure
of
studying
at
the
feet
of
masters
you
have
set
up
laboratories
in
which
your
researches
are
supervised
by
the
rykes
laboratories
we
have
no
need
of
laboratories
we
have
workshops
and
study
rooms
where
we
try
to
absorb
that
which
the
rykes
discovered
long
ago
maybe
at
some
future
time
we
will
come
to
a
point
where
we
can
reach
into
the
frontier
of
knowledge
with
our
own
minds
but
this
does
not
seem
likely
now
so
you
have
given
up
all
original
research
of
your
own
how
could
we
do
otherwise
the
rykes
have
all
the
answers
to
any
question
we
have
intelligence
enough
to
ask
follow
them
sherman
it
is
no
disgrace
to
be
led
by
such
as
the
ryke
teachers
do
you
ever
long
said
hockley
to
take
just
one
short
step
on
your
own
two
feet
why
crawl
when
you
can
go
by
carrier
thar
sipped
the
last
of
his
drink
and
glanced
toward
the
wall
clock
i
must
go
i
can
understand
the
direction
of
your
questions
and
your
thinking
you
hesitate
because
you
might
lose
the
chance
to
play
in
the
mud
and
count
the
pretty
pebbles
in
the
sand
put
away
childish
things
you
will
never
miss
them
they
shook
hands
and
a
moment
later
hockley
said
goodbye
to
thar
at
the
entrance
to
the
field
i
know
earth
will
accept
said
thar
and
you
and
i
should
not
have
lost
contact
but
we
make
up
for
it
watching
him
move
toward
the
dark
hulk
of
the
ship
hockley
wondered
if
thar
actually
believed
that
in
less
than
an
hour
they
had
exhausted
all
they
had
to
say
after
twenty
years
hockley
had
the
information
he
needed
about
the
ryke
plan
but
he
wished
he
could
have
kept
his
old
memories
of
his
student
friend
thar
was
drunk
on
the
heady
stuff
being
peddled
by
the
rykes
and
if
what
he
said
were
true
it
was
strong
enough
to
intoxicate
a
whole
planet
his
blood
grew
cold
at
the
thought
this
was
more
than
a
fight
for
the
national
laboratories
it
was
a
struggle
to
keep
all
mankind
from
becoming
what
thar
had
become
if
he
could
have
put
thar
on
exhibition
in
the
meeting
tomorrow
and
shown
what
he
was
once
like
he
would
have
made
his
point
but
thar
before
and
after
was
not
available
for
exhibit
he
had
to
find
another
way
to
show
his
colleagues
and
the
senators
what
the
rykes
would
make
of
them
he
glanced
at
his
watch
they
would
like
being
wakened
at
this
hour
but
neither
would
the
scientists
put
up
much
resistance
to
his
request
for
support
in
markham
meeting
he
went
back
to
the
bar
and
called
each
of
his
colleagues
who
had
been
in
the
meeting
that
day
hockley
was
called
first
when
the
assembly
convened
at
ten
that
morning
he
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
near
markham
and
glanced
over
the
somewhat
puzzled
expressions
of
the
scientists
i
do
know
that
i
can
speak
for
the
entire
group
of
scientists
present
he
said
we
met
yesterday
and
found
some
differences
of
opinion
concerning
this
offer
while
it
is
true
there
is
overwhelming
sentiment
supporting
it
certain
questions
remain
which
we
feel
require
additional
data
in
order
to
be
answered
properly
while
we
recognize
that
official
acceptance
can
be
given
to
the
rykes
with
no
approval
whatever
from
the
scientists
it
seems
only
fair
that
we
should
have
every
opportunity
to
make
what
we
consider
a
proper
study
and
to
express
our
opinions
in
the
matter
to
the
and
perhaps
to
many
of
my
colleagues
it
may
seem
inconceivable
that
there
could
be
any
questions
whatever
but
we
wonder
about
the
position
of
students
of
future
generations
we
wonder
about
the
details
of
administration
of
the
program
we
wonder
about
the
total
effects
of
the
program
upon
our
society
as
a
whole
we
wish
to
ask
permission
to
make
further
study
of
the
matter
in
an
effort
to
answer
these
questions
and
many
others
we
request
permission
to
go
as
a
committee
to
rykeman
iii
and
make
a
first
hand
study
of
what
the
rykes
propose
to
do
how
they
will
teach
us
and
how
they
will
dispense
the
information
they
so
generously
offer
i
ask
that
you
consider
this
most
seriously
and
make
an
official
request
of
the
rykes
to
grant
us
such
opportunity
for
study
that
you
provide
the
necessary
appropriations
for
the
trip
i
consider
it
most
urgent
that
this
be
done
at
once
there
was
a
stir
of
concern
and
disapproval
from
congressional
members
as
hockley
sat
down
senators
leaned
to
speak
in
whispers
to
their
neighbors
but
hockley
observed
the
scientists
remained
quiet
and
impassive
he
believed
he
had
sold
them
in
his
telephone
calls
during
the
early
morning
they
liked
the
idea
of
obtaining
additional
data
besides
most
of
them
wanted
to
see
rykeman
iii
for
themselves
senator
markham
finally
stood
up
obviously
disturbed
by
abrupt
proposal
it
has
seemed
to
us
members
of
the
committee
that
there
could
hardly
be
any
need
for
more
data
than
is
already
available
to
us
the
remarkable
effects
of
ryke
science
on
other
backward
worlds
is
common
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
we
recognize
the
qualifications
of
you
gentlemen
which
make
your
request
appear
justified
we
will
have
to
discuss
this
at
length
but
at
the
moment
i
believe
i
can
say
i
am
in
sympathy
with
your
request
and
can
encourage
my
committee
to
give
it
serious
consideration
a
great
deal
more
was
said
on
that
and
subsequent
days
news
of
the
ryke
offer
was
not
given
to
the
public
but
the
landing
of
the
ryke
ship
could
not
be
hidden
it
became
known
that
liacan
carried
his
offer
to
other
worlds
and
speculation
was
made
that
he
offered
it
to
earth
also
angry
questions
were
raised
as
to
why
the
purpose
of
the
visit
was
not
clarified
but
government
silence
was
maintained
while
hockley
request
was
considered
it
encountered
bitter
debate
in
the
closed
sessions
but
permission
was
finally
given
for
a
junket
of
ninety
scientists
and
ten
senators
to
rykeman
iii
this
could
not
be
hidden
so
the
facts
were
modified
and
a
story
given
out
that
the
party
was
going
to
request
participation
in
the
ryke
program
being
offered
other
worlds
that
liacan
visit
had
not
been
conclusive
in
the
days
preceding
the
hockley
felt
a
sense
of
destiny
weighing
heavily
upon
him
he
read
every
word
of
the
stream
of
opinion
that
flowed
through
the
press
every
commentator
and
columnist
seemed
called
upon
to
make
his
own
specific
analysis
of
the
possibilities
of
the
visit
to
rykeman
iii
and
the
opinions
were
almost
uniform
that
it
would
be
an
approach
to
utopia
to
have
the
rykes
take
over
hockley
was
sickened
by
this
mass
conversion
to
the
siren
call
of
the
rykes
it
was
a
tremendous
relief
when
the
day
finally
came
and
the
huge
transport
ship
lifted
solemnly
into
space
most
of
the
group
were
in
the
ship
lounge
watching
the
television
port
as
the
earth
drifted
away
beneath
them
senator
markham
seemed
nervous
and
almost
frightened
hockley
thought
as
if
something
intangible
had
escaped
him
i
hope
we
not
wasting
our
time
he
said
not
that
i
understand
your
position
he
added
hastily
to
cover
the
show
of
antagonism
he
sensed
creeping
into
his
voice
we
appreciate
your
support
said
hockley
and
we
do
our
best
to
see
the
time
of
the
investigation
is
not
wasted
but
afterwards
when
the
two
of
them
were
alone
by
the
screen
silvers
spoke
to
hockley
soberly
the
mathematician
had
lost
some
of
the
wild
exuberance
he
had
at
first
it
had
been
replaced
by
a
deep
intense
conviction
that
nothing
must
stand
in
the
way
of
earth
alliance
with
the
rykes
we
all
understand
why
you
wanted
us
to
come
he
said
we
know
you
believe
this
delay
will
cool
our
enthusiasm
it
only
fair
to
make
clear
that
it
wo
how
you
intend
to
change
us
by
taking
us
to
the
home
of
the
rykes
has
got
us
all
baffled
the
reverse
will
be
true
i
am
very
sure
we
intend
to
make
it
clear
to
the
rykes
that
we
accept
their
offer
i
hope
you
have
no
plan
to
make
a
declaration
to
the
contrary
hockley
kept
his
eyes
on
the
screen
watching
the
green
sphere
of
earth
i
have
no
intention
of
making
any
statement
of
any
kind
i
was
perfectly
honest
when
i
said
our
understanding
of
the
rykes
would
profit
by
this
visit
you
all
agreed
i
meant
nothing
more
nor
less
than
what
i
said
i
hope
no
one
in
the
group
thinks
otherwise
we
do
know
said
silvers
it
just
that
you
got
us
wondering
how
you
expect
to
change
our
views
i
have
not
said
that
is
my
intention
can
you
say
it
is
not
no
i
can
not
say
that
but
the
question
is
incomplete
my
whole
intention
is
to
discover
as
fully
as
possible
what
will
be
the
result
of
alliance
with
the
rykes
if
you
should
conclude
that
it
will
be
unfavorable
that
will
be
the
result
of
your
own
direct
observations
and
computations
not
of
my
arguments
you
may
be
sure
that
is
one
thing
that
will
not
occur
said
silvers
it
took
them
a
month
to
reach
a
transfer
point
where
they
could
change
to
a
commercial
vessel
using
ryke
principles
in
the
following
week
they
covered
a
distance
several
thousand
times
that
which
they
had
already
come
and
then
they
were
on
rykeman
iii
a
few
of
them
had
visited
the
planet
previously
on
vacation
trips
or
routine
study
expeditions
but
most
of
them
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
while
well
out
into
space
the
group
began
crowding
the
vision
screens
which
brought
into
range
the
streets
and
buildings
of
the
cities
they
could
see
the
people
walking
and
riding
there
hockley
caught
his
breath
at
the
sight
and
doubts
overwhelmed
him
telling
him
he
was
an
utter
and
complete
fool
the
city
upon
which
he
looked
was
a
jewel
of
perfection
buildings
were
not
indiscriminate
masses
of
masonry
and
metal
and
plastic
heaped
up
without
regard
to
the
total
effect
rather
the
city
was
a
unit
created
with
an
eye
to
esthetic
perfection
silvers
stood
beside
hockley
we
got
a
chance
to
make
earth
look
that
way
said
the
mathematician
there
only
one
thing
missing
said
hockley
the
price
tag
we
still
need
to
know
what
it
going
to
cost
upon
landing
the
earthmen
were
greeted
by
a
covey
of
their
hosts
who
scurried
about
introducing
themselves
in
their
high
whistling
voices
in
busses
they
were
moved
half
way
across
the
city
to
a
building
which
stood
beside
an
enormous
park
area
it
was
obviously
a
building
designed
for
the
reception
of
just
such
delegations
as
this
one
giving
hockley
evidence
that
perhaps
his
idea
was
not
so
original
after
all
it
was
a
relief
to
get
inside
after
their
brief
trip
across
the
city
gravity
temperature
and
air
pressure
and
composition
duplicated
those
of
earth
inside
and
conditions
could
be
varied
to
accommodate
many
different
species
hockley
felt
confident
they
could
become
accustomed
to
outside
conditions
after
a
few
days
but
it
was
exhausting
now
to
be
out
for
long
they
were
shown
to
individual
quarters
and
given
leisure
to
unpack
and
inspect
their
surroundings
furniture
had
been
adjusted
to
their
size
and
needs
the
only
oversight
hockley
could
find
was
a
faint
odor
of
chlorine
lingering
in
the
closets
he
wondered
who
the
last
occupant
of
the
room
had
been
after
a
noon
meal
served
with
foods
of
astonishingly
close
approximation
to
their
native
fare
the
group
was
offered
a
prelude
to
the
general
instruction
and
indoctrination
which
would
begin
the
following
day
this
was
in
the
form
of
a
guided
tour
through
the
science
museum
which
hockley
gathered
was
a
modernized
ryke
parallel
to
the
venerable
smithsonian
back
home
the
tour
was
entirely
optional
as
far
as
the
planned
program
of
the
rykes
was
concerned
but
none
of
the
earthmen
turned
it
down
hockley
tried
to
concentrate
heavily
on
the
memory
of
waldon
thar
and
keep
the
image
of
his
friend
always
before
him
as
he
moved
through
the
city
and
inspected
the
works
of
the
rykes
he
found
it
helped
suppress
the
awe
and
adulation
which
he
had
an
impulse
to
share
with
his
companions
it
was
possible
even
he
found
to
adopt
a
kind
of
truculent
cynicism
toward
the
approach
the
rykes
were
making
the
visit
to
the
science
museum
be
an
attempt
to
bowl
them
over
with
an
vista
of
ryke
superiority
in
the
sciences
at
least
that
was
most
certainly
the
effect
on
them
hockley
cursed
his
own
feeling
of
ignorance
and
inferiority
as
the
guide
led
them
quietly
past
the
works
of
the
masters
offering
but
little
comment
letting
them
see
for
themselves
the
obvious
relationships
in
the
massive
display
showing
developments
of
spaceflight
the
atomic
vessels
not
much
different
from
earthmen
best
efforts
were
far
down
the
line
very
near
to
the
earliest
attempts
of
the
rykes
to
rocket
their
way
into
space
beyond
that
level
was
an
incredible
series
of
developments
incomprehensible
to
most
of
the
earthmen
illustration
and
to
all
their
questions
the
guide
offered
the
monotonous
reply
that
will
be
explained
to
you
later
we
only
wish
to
give
you
an
overall
picture
of
our
culture
at
the
present
time
but
this
was
not
enough
for
one
of
the
astronomers
named
moore
who
moved
ahead
of
hockley
in
the
crowd
hockley
saw
the
back
of
neck
growing
redder
by
the
minute
as
the
guide
evasive
answer
was
repeated
finally
moore
forced
a
discussion
regarding
the
merits
of
some
systems
of
comparing
the
brightness
of
stars
which
the
guide
briefly
showed
them
the
guide
in
great
annoyance
burst
out
with
a
stream
of
explanation
that
completely
flattened
any
opinions
moore
might
have
had
but
at
the
same
time
the
astronomer
grinned
amiably
at
the
ryke
that
ought
to
settle
that
he
said
i
bet
it
wo
take
a
week
to
get
our
system
changed
back
home
moore
success
loosened
the
restraint
of
the
others
and
they
beseiged
the
guide
mercilessly
then
with
opinions
questions
comparisons
and
even
mild
disapprovals
the
guide
exasperation
was
obvious
and
pleasant
to
hockley
who
remained
a
bystander
it
was
frightening
to
markham
and
some
of
the
other
senators
who
were
unable
to
take
part
in
the
discussion
but
most
of
the
scientists
failed
to
notice
it
in
their
eagerness
to
learn
after
dinner
that
night
they
gathered
in
the
lounge
and
study
of
their
quarters
markham
stood
beside
hockley
as
they
partook
cautiously
of
the
cocktails
which
the
rykes
had
attempted
to
duplicate
for
them
the
senator
awe
had
returned
to
overshadow
any
concern
he
felt
during
the
events
of
the
afternoon
a
wonderful
day
he
said
even
though
this
visit
delays
completion
of
our
arrangements
with
the
rykes
those
of
us
here
will
be
grateful
forever
that
you
proposed
it
nothing
could
have
so
impressed
us
all
with
the
desirability
of
accepting
the
tutelage
it
was
a
stroke
of
genius
hockley
and
for
a
time
i
thought
you
were
actually
opposed
to
the
rykes
he
sipped
his
drink
while
hockley
said
nothing
then
his
brow
furrowed
a
bit
but
i
wonder
why
our
guide
cut
short
our
tour
this
afternoon
if
i
recall
correctly
he
said
at
the
beginning
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
see
than
he
actually
showed
us
hockley
smiled
and
sipped
politely
at
his
drink
before
he
set
it
down
and
faced
the
senator
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
else
noticed
that
he
said
hockley
slept
well
that
night
except
for
the
fact
that
occasional
whiffs
of
chlorine
seemed
to
drift
from
various
corners
of
the
room
even
though
he
turned
the
system
on
full
blast
in
the
morning
there
began
a
series
of
specialized
lectures
which
had
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
the
earthmen
request
to
acquaint
them
with
what
they
would
be
getting
upon
acceptance
of
the
ryke
offer
it
was
obviously
no
new
experience
for
the
rykes
the
lectures
were
well
prepared
and
anticipated
many
questions
the
only
thing
new
about
it
hockley
thought
was
the
delivery
in
the
language
of
the
earthmen
otherwise
he
felt
this
was
something
prepared
a
long
time
ago
and
given
a
thousand
times
or
more
they
were
divided
into
smaller
groups
according
to
their
specialties
electronic
men
going
one
way
astronomers
and
mathematical
physicists
another
chemists
and
general
physicists
in
still
another
direction
hockley
showalter
and
the
senators
were
considered
more
or
less
free
floating
members
of
the
delegation
with
the
privilege
of
visiting
with
one
group
or
another
according
to
their
pleasure
hockley
chose
to
spend
the
first
day
with
the
chemists
since
that
was
his
own
first
love
showalter
and
senator
markham
came
along
with
him
as
much
as
he
tried
he
found
it
virtually
impossible
not
to
sit
with
the
same
wonder
that
his
colleagues
exhibited
the
swift
exposition
of
the
ryke
lecturer
led
them
immediately
beyond
their
own
realms
but
so
carefully
did
he
lead
them
that
it
seemed
that
they
must
have
come
this
way
before
and
forgotten
it
hockley
felt
half
angry
with
himself
he
felt
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
hypnotized
by
the
skill
of
the
ryke
and
wondered
despairingly
if
there
were
any
chance
at
all
of
combating
their
approach
he
saw
nothing
to
indicate
it
in
the
experience
of
that
day
or
the
ones
immediately
following
but
he
retained
hope
that
there
was
much
significance
in
the
action
of
the
guide
who
had
cut
short
their
visit
to
the
museum
in
the
evenings
in
the
study
lounge
of
the
dormitory
they
held
interminable
bull
sessions
exchanging
and
digesting
what
they
had
been
shown
during
the
day
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
that
hockley
thought
he
could
detect
a
subtle
change
in
the
group
he
had
some
difficulty
analyzing
it
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
a
growing
aliveness
a
sort
of
recovery
and
then
he
recognized
that
the
initial
stunned
reaction
to
the
magnificence
of
the
rykes
was
passing
off
they
had
been
shocked
by
the
impact
of
the
rykes
almost
as
if
they
had
been
struck
a
blow
on
the
head
temporarily
they
had
shelved
all
their
own
analytical
and
critical
facilities
and
yielded
to
the
rykes
without
question
now
they
were
beginning
to
recover
springing
back
to
a
condition
considerably
nearer
normal
hockley
felt
a
surge
of
encouragement
as
he
detected
a
more
sharply
critical
evaluation
in
the
conversations
that
buzzed
around
him
the
enthusiasm
was
more
measured
it
was
the
following
evening
however
that
witnessed
the
first
event
of
pronounced
shifting
of
anyone
attitude
they
had
finished
dinner
and
were
gathering
in
the
lounge
sparring
around
setting
up
groups
for
the
bull
sessions
that
would
go
until
long
after
midnight
most
of
them
had
already
settled
down
and
were
talking
part
in
conversations
or
were
listening
quietly
when
they
were
suddenly
aware
of
a
change
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
for
a
moment
there
was
a
general
turning
of
heads
to
locate
the
source
of
the
disturbance
hockley
knew
he
could
never
describe
just
what
made
him
look
around
but
he
was
abruptly
conscious
that
silvers
was
walking
into
the
lounge
and
looking
slowly
about
at
those
gathered
there
something
in
his
presence
was
like
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
thundercloud
his
face
seemed
to
reflect
the
dark
turbulence
of
a
summer
storm
he
said
nothing
however
to
anyone
but
strode
over
and
sat
beside
hockley
who
was
alone
at
the
moment
smoking
the
next
to
last
of
his
earthside
cigars
hockley
felt
the
smouldering
turmoil
inside
the
mathematician
he
extended
his
final
cigar
silvers
brushed
it
away
the
last
one
said
hockley
mildly
in
spite
of
all
their
abilities
the
ryke
imitations
are
somewhat
less
than
natural
silvers
turned
slowly
to
face
hockley
i
presented
them
with
the
legrandian
equations
today
he
said
i
expected
to
get
a
straightforward
answer
to
a
perfectly
legitimate
scientific
question
that
is
what
we
were
led
to
expect
was
it
not
illustration
hockley
nodded
that
my
impression
did
you
get
something
less
than
a
straightforward
answer
the
mathematician
exhaled
noisily
the
legrandian
equations
will
lead
to
a
geometry
as
revolutionary
as
riemann
was
in
his
day
but
i
was
told
by
the
rykes
that
i
dismiss
it
from
all
further
consideration
it
does
not
lead
to
any
profitable
mathematical
development
hockley
felt
that
his
heart
most
certainly
skipped
a
beat
but
he
managed
to
keep
his
voice
steady
and
sympathetic
that
too
bad
i
know
what
high
hopes
you
had
i
suppose
you
will
give
up
work
on
the
equations
now
i
will
not
silvers
exclaimed
loudly
nearby
groups
who
had
returned
hesitantly
to
their
own
conversations
now
stared
at
him
again
but
abruptly
he
changed
his
tone
and
looked
almost
pleadingly
at
hockley
i
do
understand
it
why
should
they
say
such
a
thing
it
appears
to
be
one
of
the
most
profitable
avenues
of
exploration
i
have
encountered
in
my
whole
career
and
the
rykes
brush
it
aside
what
did
you
say
when
they
told
you
to
give
it
up
i
said
i
wanted
to
know
where
the
development
would
lead
i
said
it
had
been
indicated
that
we
could
have
an
answer
to
any
scientific
problem
within
the
range
of
their
abilities
and
certainly
this
is
from
what
i
seen
the
instructor
replied
that
i
been
given
an
answer
to
my
question
that
first
lesson
you
must
learn
if
you
wish
to
acquire
our
pace
in
science
is
to
recognize
that
we
have
been
along
the
path
ahead
of
you
we
know
which
are
the
possibilities
that
are
worthwhile
to
develop
we
have
gained
our
speed
by
learning
to
bypass
every
avenue
but
the
main
one
and
not
get
lost
in
tempting
side
roads
he
said
that
we
got
to
learn
to
trust
them
and
take
their
word
as
to
which
is
the
correct
and
profitable
field
of
research
that
will
show
you
where
to
go
as
we
agreed
to
do
if
you
are
not
willing
to
accept
our
leadership
in
this
respect
our
agreement
means
nothing
would
that
be
a
magnificent
way
to
make
scientific
progress
the
mathematician
shifted
in
his
chair
as
if
trying
to
control
an
internal
fury
that
would
not
be
capped
he
held
out
his
hand
abruptly
i
take
that
cigar
after
all
if
you
do
mind
hockley
with
savage
energy
he
chewed
the
end
and
ignited
the
cigar
then
blew
a
mammoth
cloud
of
smoke
ceilingward
i
think
the
trouble
must
be
in
our
lecturer
he
said
he
crazy
he
could
possibly
represent
the
conventional
attitude
of
the
rykes
they
promised
to
give
answers
to
our
problems
and
this
is
the
kind
of
nonsense
i
get
i
going
to
see
somebody
higher
up
and
find
out
why
we
ca
have
a
lecturer
who
knows
what
he
talking
about
or
maybe
you
or
markham
would
rather
take
it
up
through
official
channels
as
it
were
the
ryke
was
correct
said
hockley
he
give
you
an
answer
he
could
answer
our
questions
that
way
you
perfectly
right
said
hockley
soberly
he
could
do
exactly
that
they
wo
of
course
said
silvers
defensively
even
if
this
particular
character
is
just
playing
the
screwball
my
question
is
just
a
special
case
it
just
one
particular
thing
they
consider
to
be
valueless
perhaps
in
the
end
i
find
they
right
but
i
going
to
develop
a
solution
to
these
equations
if
it
takes
the
rest
of
my
life
after
all
they
admit
they
have
no
solution
that
they
have
not
bothered
to
go
down
this
particular
side
path
as
they
put
it
if
we
do
go
down
it
how
can
we
ever
know
whether
it
worthwhile
or
not
how
can
the
rykes
know
what
they
may
have
missed
by
not
doing
so
i
ca
answer
that
said
hockley
for
us
or
for
them
i
know
of
no
other
way
to
predict
the
outcome
of
a
specific
line
of
research
except
to
carry
it
through
and
find
out
what
lies
at
the
end
of
the
road
hockley
did
sleep
very
well
after
he
finally
went
to
bed
that
night
silvers
had
presented
him
with
the
break
he
had
been
expecting
and
hoping
for
the
first
chink
in
the
armor
of
sanctity
surrounding
the
rykes
now
he
wondered
what
would
follow
if
this
would
build
up
to
the
impassable
barrier
he
wanted
or
if
it
would
merely
remain
a
sore
obstacle
in
their
way
but
eventually
be
bypassed
and
forgotten
he
did
not
believe
it
would
be
the
only
incident
of
its
kind
there
would
be
others
as
the
earthmen
stunned
blind
acceptance
gave
way
completely
to
sound
critical
evaluation
and
in
any
case
there
was
one
delegate
who
would
never
be
the
same
again
no
matter
how
he
eventually
rationalized
it
forman
silvers
would
never
feel
quite
the
same
about
the
rykes
as
he
did
before
they
rejected
his
favorite
piece
of
research
hockley
arose
early
eager
but
cautious
his
senses
open
for
further
evidence
of
disaffection
springing
up
he
joined
the
group
of
chemists
once
more
for
the
morning
lecture
the
spirit
of
the
group
was
markedly
higher
than
when
he
first
met
with
them
they
had
been
inspired
by
what
the
rykes
had
shown
them
but
in
addition
their
own
sense
of
judgment
had
been
brought
out
of
suspension
the
ryke
lecturer
began
inscribing
on
the
board
an
enormous
organic
formula
using
conventions
of
earth
chemistry
for
the
benefit
of
his
audience
he
explained
at
some
length
a
number
of
transformations
which
it
was
possible
to
make
in
the
compound
by
means
of
high
intensity
fields
almost
at
once
one
of
the
younger
chemists
named
carmen
was
on
his
feet
exclaiming
excitedly
that
one
of
the
transformation
compounds
was
a
chemical
on
which
he
had
conducted
an
extensive
research
he
had
produced
enough
to
know
that
it
had
a
multitude
of
intriguing
properties
and
now
he
was
exuberant
at
the
revelation
of
a
method
of
producing
it
in
quantity
and
also
further
transforming
it
at
his
sudden
enthusiasm
the
lecturer
face
took
on
what
they
had
come
to
recognize
as
a
very
dour
look
that
series
of
transformations
has
no
interest
for
us
he
said
i
merely
indicated
its
existence
to
show
one
of
the
possibilities
which
should
be
avoided
over
here
you
see
the
direction
in
which
we
wish
to
go
but
you
never
saw
anything
with
properties
like
that
carmen
protested
it
goes
through
an
incredible
series
of
at
least
three
phase
changes
with
an
increase
in
pressure
alone
but
with
proper
control
of
heat
it
can
be
kept
in
the
crystalline
phase
regardless
of
pressure
it
is
closely
related
to
a
drug
series
with
anesthetic
properties
and
is
almost
sure
to
be
valuable
in
the
ryke
lecturer
cut
him
off
sharply
i
have
explained
he
said
the
direction
of
transformation
in
which
we
are
interested
your
concern
is
not
with
anything
beyond
the
boundaries
which
our
study
has
proven
to
be
the
direct
path
of
research
and
study
then
i
should
abandon
research
on
this
series
of
chemicals
carmen
asked
with
a
show
of
outward
meekness
the
ryke
nodded
with
pleasure
at
carmen
submissiveness
that
is
it
precisely
we
have
been
over
this
ground
long
ago
we
know
where
the
areas
of
profitable
study
lie
you
will
be
told
what
to
observe
and
what
to
ignore
how
could
you
ever
hope
to
make
progress
if
you
stopped
to
examine
every
alternate
probability
and
possibility
that
appeared
to
you
he
shook
his
head
vigorously
and
his
plume
vibrated
with
emotion
you
must
have
a
plan
he
continued
a
goal
study
of
the
universe
can
not
proceed
in
any
random
erratic
fashion
you
must
know
what
you
want
and
then
find
out
where
to
look
for
it
carmen
sat
down
slowly
hockley
was
sure
the
ryke
did
not
notice
the
tense
bulge
of
the
chemist
jaw
muscles
perhaps
he
would
not
have
understood
the
significance
if
he
had
noticed
hockley
was
a
trifle
late
in
getting
to
the
dining
room
at
lunch
time
that
day
by
the
time
he
did
so
the
place
was
like
a
beehive
he
was
almost
repelled
by
the
furor
of
conversation
circulating
in
the
room
as
he
entered
he
passed
through
slowly
searching
for
a
table
of
his
own
he
paused
a
moment
behind
carmen
who
was
declaiming
in
no
mild
terms
his
opinions
of
a
system
that
would
those
areas
of
research
which
were
to
be
entered
and
those
which
were
not
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
caught
the
eye
of
one
of
the
dozen
chemists
seated
at
the
table
listening
moving
on
he
observed
that
silvers
had
also
cornered
a
half
dozen
or
so
of
his
colleagues
in
his
own
field
and
was
in
earnest
conversation
with
them
in
a
considerably
more
restrained
manner
however
than
he
had
used
the
previous
evening
with
hockley
or
than
carmen
was
using
at
the
present
time
the
entire
room
was
abuzz
with
similar
groups
the
senators
had
tried
to
mingle
with
the
others
in
past
days
always
with
more
or
less
lack
of
success
because
they
found
themselves
out
of
the
conversation
almost
completely
today
they
had
no
luck
whatever
they
were
seated
together
at
a
couple
of
tables
in
a
corner
none
of
them
seemed
to
be
paying
attention
to
the
food
before
them
but
were
glancing
about
at
their
fellow
diners
who
were
also
paying
no
attention
to
food
hockley
caught
sight
of
his
political
colleagues
and
sensed
their
dismay
the
field
of
disquietude
seemed
almost
tangible
in
the
air
the
senators
seemed
half
frightened
by
what
they
felt
but
could
not
understand
showalter
wild
waving
at
the
far
corner
of
the
room
finally
caught
hockley
eye
and
he
moved
toward
the
small
table
which
the
assistant
had
reserved
for
them
showalter
was
upset
too
by
the
atmosphere
within
the
room
what
the
devil
is
up
he
said
seems
like
everybody
on
edge
this
morning
i
never
saw
a
bunch
of
guys
so
touchy
you
think
they
woke
up
with
snakes
in
their
beds
did
you
know
said
hockley
have
you
been
to
any
of
the
lectures
this
morning
no
a
couple
of
the
senators
were
getting
bored
with
all
the
scientific
doings
so
i
thought
maybe
i
should
try
to
entertain
them
we
took
in
what
passes
for
such
here
but
it
was
much
better
than
the
lectures
as
a
show
tell
me
what
up
briefly
hockley
described
silvers
upset
of
the
day
before
and
experience
that
morning
showalter
let
his
glance
rove
over
his
fellow
earthmen
trying
to
catch
snatches
of
the
buzzing
conversation
at
nearby
tables
you
think
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
got
them
all
going
this
morning
he
said
hockley
nodded
i
caught
enough
of
it
passing
through
to
know
what
it
is
i
gather
that
every
group
has
run
into
the
same
kind
of
thing
by
now
the
fencing
off
of
broad
areas
where
we
have
already
tried
to
do
research
after
the
first
cloud
of
awe
wore
off
the
first
thing
everyone
wanted
was
an
answer
to
his
own
pet
line
of
research
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
was
something
the
rykes
told
them
to
chuck
down
the
drain
that
advice
does
sit
so
well
as
you
can
plainly
see
showalter
drew
back
his
gaze
and
stared
for
a
long
time
at
hockley
you
knew
this
would
happen
that
why
you
brought
us
here
i
had
hopes
of
it
i
was
reasonably
sure
this
was
the
way
the
rykes
operated
showalter
remained
thoughtful
for
a
long
time
before
he
spoke
again
you
won
your
point
i
suppose
as
far
as
this
group
goes
but
you
ca
hope
to
convince
all
of
earth
by
this
the
rykes
will
hold
their
offer
open
and
others
will
accept
it
on
behalf
of
earth
and
what
if
it
we
who
are
wrong
in
the
end
how
can
you
be
sure
that
this
is
the
way
the
rykes
have
made
their
tremendous
speed
by
not
going
down
all
the
blind
alleys
that
we
rattle
around
in
i
sure
it
the
way
they
have
attained
such
speed
of
advancement
then
maybe
we
ought
to
go
along
regardless
of
our
own
desires
maybe
we
never
did
know
how
to
do
research
hockley
smiled
across
the
table
at
his
assistant
you
believe
that
of
course
i
just
talking
said
showalter
irritably
the
thing
gets
more
loopy
every
day
if
you
think
you
understand
the
rykes
i
wish
you
would
give
out
with
what
the
score
is
by
the
looks
of
most
of
these
guys
i
would
say
they
are
getting
ready
to
throttle
the
next
ryke
they
see
instead
of
knuckle
under
to
him
i
hope
you
right
said
hockley
fervently
i
certainly
hope
right
by
evening
there
was
increasing
evidence
that
he
was
hockley
passed
up
the
afternoon
lecture
period
and
spent
the
time
in
the
lounge
doing
some
thinking
of
his
own
he
knew
he
could
push
the
group
above
all
he
must
give
way
to
any
temptation
to
push
them
or
say
i
told
you
so
their
present
frustration
was
so
deep
that
their
antagonism
could
be
turned
almost
indiscriminately
in
any
direction
and
he
would
be
offering
himself
as
a
ready
target
if
he
were
not
careful
on
the
other
hand
he
had
to
be
ready
to
take
advantage
of
their
disaffection
and
throw
them
a
decisive
challenge
when
they
were
ready
for
it
that
might
be
tonight
or
it
might
be
another
week
he
wished
for
a
sure
way
of
knowing
as
things
turned
out
however
the
necessity
of
choosing
the
time
was
taken
from
him
after
dinner
that
night
when
the
group
began
to
drift
into
the
lounge
silvers
and
carmen
and
three
of
the
other
men
came
over
to
where
hockley
sat
silvers
fumbled
with
the
buttons
of
his
coat
as
if
preparing
to
make
an
address
we
like
to
request
he
said
that
is
we
think
we
ought
to
get
together
we
like
you
to
call
a
meeting
hockley
some
of
us
have
a
few
things
we
like
to
talk
over
hockley
nodded
his
face
impassive
the
matter
i
mentioned
to
you
the
other
night
said
silvers
been
happening
to
all
the
men
we
think
we
ought
to
talk
about
it
fine
said
hockley
i
been
thinking
it
would
perhaps
be
a
good
idea
pass
the
word
around
and
let
get
some
chairs
we
can
convene
in
ten
minutes
the
others
nodded
somberly
and
moved
away
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
preparing
for
a
funeral
and
maybe
that
what
it
would
be
hockley
thought
somebody
funeral
he
hoped
it
would
be
the
rykes
the
room
began
filling
almost
at
once
as
if
they
had
been
expecting
the
call
in
little
more
than
five
minutes
it
seemed
that
every
member
of
the
earth
delegation
had
assembled
leaving
time
to
spare
the
senators
still
wore
their
looks
of
puzzlement
and
anxiety
which
had
intensified
if
anything
there
was
no
puzzlement
on
the
faces
of
the
scientists
however
only
a
set
and
determined
expression
that
hockley
hardly
dared
interpret
as
meaning
they
had
made
up
their
minds
he
had
to
have
their
verbal
confirmation
informally
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
sauntered
to
the
front
of
the
group
i
have
been
asked
to
call
a
meeting
he
said
by
certain
members
of
the
group
who
have
something
on
their
minds
they
seem
to
feel
we
all
be
interested
in
what
is
troubling
them
since
i
have
nothing
in
particular
to
say
i
simply
going
to
turn
the
floor
over
to
those
of
you
who
have
silvers
first
approached
me
to
call
this
discussion
so
i
shall
ask
him
to
lead
off
will
you
come
to
the
front
dr
silvers
the
mathematician
rose
as
if
wishing
someone
else
would
do
the
talking
he
stood
at
one
side
of
the
group
halfway
to
the
rear
i
can
do
all
right
from
here
he
said
after
a
pause
as
if
coming
to
a
momentous
decision
he
plunged
into
his
complaint
it
appears
that
nearly
all
of
us
have
encountered
an
aspect
of
the
ryke
culture
and
character
which
was
not
anticipated
when
we
first
received
their
offer
briefly
he
related
the
details
of
the
ryke
rejection
of
his
research
on
the
legrandian
equations
we
were
told
we
were
going
to
have
all
our
questions
answered
that
the
ryke
science
included
all
we
could
anticipate
or
hope
to
accomplish
in
the
next
few
millenia
i
swallowed
that
we
all
did
it
appears
we
were
slightly
in
error
it
begins
to
appear
as
if
we
are
not
going
to
find
the
intellectual
paradise
we
anticipated
he
smiled
wryly
i
sure
none
of
you
is
more
ready
than
i
to
admit
he
has
been
a
fool
it
appears
that
paradise
consists
merely
of
a
few
selected
gems
which
the
rykes
consider
particularly
valuable
while
the
rest
of
the
field
goes
untouched
i
want
to
offer
public
apologies
to
hockley
who
saw
and
understood
the
situation
as
it
actually
existed
while
the
rest
of
us
had
our
heads
in
the
clouds
exactly
how
he
knew
i
not
sure
but
he
did
and
very
brilliantly
chose
the
only
way
possible
to
convince
us
that
what
he
knew
was
correct
i
suggest
we
do
our
packing
tonight
gentlemen
let
us
return
at
once
to
our
laboratories
and
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
some
degree
of
atonement
for
being
such
fools
as
to
fall
for
the
line
the
rykes
tried
to
sell
us
hockley
eyes
were
on
the
senators
at
first
there
were
white
faces
filled
with
incredulity
as
the
mathematician
proceeded
then
slowly
this
changed
to
sheer
horror
when
silvers
finished
there
was
immediate
bedlam
there
was
a
clamor
of
voices
from
the
scientists
most
of
whom
seemed
to
be
trying
to
affirm
silvers
position
this
was
offset
by
explosions
of
rage
from
the
senatorial
members
of
the
group
hockley
let
it
go
not
even
raising
his
hands
for
order
until
finally
the
racket
died
of
its
own
accord
as
the
eyes
of
the
delegates
came
to
rest
upon
him
and
then
before
he
could
speak
markham
was
on
his
feet
this
is
absolutely
moral
treachery
he
thundered
i
have
never
heard
a
more
vicious
revocation
of
a
pledged
word
than
i
have
heard
this
evening
you
men
are
not
alone
concerned
in
this
matter
for
all
practical
purposes
you
are
not
concerned
at
all
and
yet
to
take
it
upon
yourselves
to
pass
judgment
in
a
matter
that
is
the
affair
of
the
entire
population
of
earth
out
of
nothing
more
than
sheer
spite
because
the
rykes
refuse
recognition
of
your
own
childish
projects
i
have
never
heard
a
more
incredible
and
infantile
performance
than
you
supposedly
mature
gentlemen
of
science
are
expressing
this
evening
he
glared
defiantly
at
hockley
who
was
again
the
center
of
attention
moving
carelessly
to
the
center
of
the
stage
anybody
want
to
try
to
answer
the
senator
he
asked
casually
instantly
a
score
of
men
were
on
their
feet
speaking
simultaneously
they
stopped
abruptly
looking
deferentially
to
their
neighbors
and
at
hockley
inviting
him
to
choose
one
of
them
to
be
spokesman
maybe
i
ought
to
answer
him
myself
said
hockley
since
i
predicted
that
this
would
occur
and
that
we
ought
to
make
a
trial
run
before
turning
our
collective
gray
matter
over
to
the
rykes
a
chorus
of
approval
and
nodding
heads
gave
him
the
go
ahead
the
senator
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
we
few
are
not
alone
in
our
concern
in
this
matter
he
said
but
the
senator
intends
to
imply
a
major
difference
between
us
scientists
and
the
rest
of
mankind
this
is
his
error
every
member
of
mankind
who
is
concerned
about
the
universe
in
which
he
lives
is
a
scientist
you
need
to
understand
what
a
scientist
is
and
you
can
say
no
more
than
that
he
is
a
human
being
trying
to
solve
the
problem
of
understanding
his
universe
immediate
or
remote
he
is
concerned
about
the
inanimate
worlds
his
own
personality
his
fellow
men
and
the
interweaving
relationships
among
all
these
factors
we
professional
scientists
are
no
strange
species
alien
to
our
race
our
only
difference
is
perhaps
that
we
undertake
problems
than
does
the
average
of
our
fellow
men
and
of
a
more
complex
kind
that
is
all
the
essence
of
our
science
is
a
relentless
personal
yearning
to
know
and
understand
the
universe
and
in
that
the
scientist
must
not
be
forbidden
to
ask
whatever
question
occurs
to
him
the
moment
we
put
any
restraint
upon
our
fields
of
inquiry
or
set
bounds
to
the
realms
of
our
mental
aspirations
our
science
ceases
to
exist
and
becomes
a
mere
opportunist
technology
markham
stood
up
his
face
red
with
exasperation
and
rage
no
one
is
trying
to
limit
you
why
is
that
so
unfathomable
to
your
minds
you
are
being
offered
a
boundless
expanse
and
you
continue
to
make
inane
complaints
of
limitations
the
rykes
have
been
over
all
the
territory
you
insist
on
exploring
they
can
tell
you
the
number
of
pretty
pebbles
and
empty
shells
that
lie
there
you
are
like
children
insistent
upon
exploring
every
shadowy
corner
and
peering
behind
every
useless
bush
on
a
walk
through
the
forest
such
is
to
be
expected
of
a
child
but
not
of
an
adult
who
is
capable
of
taking
the
word
of
one
who
has
been
there
before
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
your
argument
said
hockley
first
of
all
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
the
learning
of
a
child
who
must
indeed
explore
the
dark
corners
and
strange
growths
by
which
he
passes
there
is
no
difference
between
this
and
the
probing
of
the
scientist
who
must
explore
the
universe
with
his
own
senses
and
with
his
own
instruments
without
taking
another
word
that
there
is
nothing
there
worth
seeing
secondly
the
rykes
themselves
are
badly
in
error
in
asserting
that
they
have
been
along
the
way
ahead
of
us
they
have
not
in
all
their
fields
of
science
they
have
limited
themselves
badly
to
one
narrow
field
of
probability
they
have
taken
a
narrow
path
stretching
between
magnificent
vistas
on
either
side
of
them
and
have
deliberately
ignored
all
that
was
beyond
the
path
and
on
the
inviting
side
trails
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
demanded
markham
if
you
undertake
a
journey
you
do
weave
in
and
out
of
every
possible
path
that
leads
in
every
direction
opposed
to
your
destination
you
take
the
direct
route
or
at
least
people
do
scientists
do
too
said
hockley
when
they
take
a
journey
professional
science
is
not
a
journey
however
it
an
exploration
there
is
a
great
deal
wrong
with
what
the
rykes
have
done
they
have
assumed
and
would
have
us
likewise
assume
that
there
is
a
certain
very
specific
future
toward
which
we
are
all
moving
this
future
is
built
out
of
the
discoveries
they
have
made
about
the
universe
it
is
made
of
the
system
of
mathematics
they
have
developed
which
exclude
cherished
legrandian
equations
it
excludes
the
world
in
which
exist
carmen
series
of
unique
compounds
the
rykes
have
built
a
wonderful
workable
world
of
serenity
beauty
scientific
consistency
and
economic
adjustment
they
have
eliminated
enormous
amounts
of
chaos
which
earthmen
continue
to
suffer
but
we
do
not
want
what
the
rykes
have
obtained
if
we
have
to
pay
their
price
for
it
then
you
are
complete
fools
said
markham
fortunately
you
can
not
and
will
not
speak
for
all
of
earth
hockley
paced
back
and
forth
a
half
dozen
steps
his
eyes
on
the
floor
i
think
we
do
and
can
speak
for
all
our
people
he
said
remember
i
said
that
all
men
are
scientists
in
the
final
analysis
i
am
very
certain
that
no
earthman
who
truly
understood
the
situation
would
want
to
face
the
future
which
the
rykes
hold
out
to
us
and
why
not
demanded
markham
because
there
are
too
many
possible
futures
we
refuse
to
march
down
a
single
narrow
trail
to
golden
future
that
what
the
rykes
would
have
us
do
but
they
are
wrong
it
would
be
like
taking
a
trip
through
a
galaxy
at
speeds
faster
than
light
and
claiming
to
have
seen
the
galaxy
what
the
rykes
have
obtained
is
genuine
and
good
but
what
they
have
not
obtained
is
perhaps
far
better
and
of
greater
worth
how
can
you
know
such
an
absurd
thing
we
ca
not
for
sure
said
hockley
not
until
we
go
there
and
see
for
ourselves
step
by
step
but
we
are
going
to
be
confined
to
the
rykes
narrow
trail
we
are
going
on
a
broad
path
to
take
in
as
many
byways
as
we
can
possibly
find
we
explore
every
probability
we
come
to
and
look
behind
every
bush
and
under
every
pebble
we
will
move
together
the
thousands
and
the
millions
of
us
simultaneously
interacting
with
one
another
exchanging
data
most
certainly
many
will
end
up
in
blind
alleys
some
will
find
data
that
seems
the
ultimate
truth
at
one
point
and
pure
deception
at
another
who
can
tell
ahead
of
time
which
of
these
multiple
paths
we
should
take
certainly
not
the
rykes
who
have
bypassed
most
of
them
it
does
matter
that
many
paths
lead
to
failure
not
as
long
as
we
remain
in
communication
with
each
other
in
the
end
we
will
find
the
best
possible
future
for
us
but
there
is
no
future
only
a
multitude
of
possible
futures
we
must
have
the
right
to
build
the
one
that
best
fits
our
own
kind
is
that
more
important
than
achieving
immediately
a
more
peaceful
unified
and
secure
society
said
markham
infinitely
more
important
said
hockley
it
is
fortunate
at
least
then
that
you
are
in
no
position
to
implement
these
insane
beliefs
of
yours
the
ryke
program
was
offered
to
earth
and
it
shall
be
accepted
on
behalf
of
earth
you
may
be
sure
of
a
very
poor
hearing
when
you
try
to
present
these
notions
back
home
you
jump
to
conclusions
senator
said
hockley
with
mild
confidence
why
do
you
suppose
i
proposed
this
trip
if
i
did
not
believe
i
could
do
something
about
the
situation
i
assure
you
that
we
did
not
come
just
to
see
the
sights
markham
jaw
slacked
and
his
face
became
white
what
do
you
mean
you
have
dared
to
try
to
alienate
the
rykes
i
mean
that
there
is
a
great
deal
we
can
do
about
the
situation
now
that
the
sentiments
of
my
colleagues
parallel
my
own
i
sure
they
agree
that
we
must
effectively
and
finally
spike
any
possibility
of
becoming
involved
in
this
ryke
nonsense
you
would
dare
even
if
you
could
we
can
and
we
dare
said
hockley
when
we
return
to
earth
we
shall
have
to
report
that
the
rykes
have
refused
to
admit
earth
to
their
program
we
shall
report
that
we
made
every
effort
to
obtain
an
agreement
with
them
but
it
was
in
vain
if
anyone
wishes
to
verify
the
report
the
rykes
themselves
will
say
that
this
is
quite
true
they
can
not
possibly
consider
earth
as
a
participant
if
you
contend
that
an
offer
was
once
made
you
will
not
find
the
rykes
offering
much
support
since
they
will
be
very
busily
denying
that
we
are
remotely
qualified
the
rykes
are
hardly
ones
to
meekly
submit
to
any
idiotic
plan
of
that
kind
they
ca
help
it
if
we
demonstrate
that
we
quite
unqualified
to
participate
you
you
it
will
not
be
difficult
said
hockley
the
rykes
have
set
up
a
perfect
situation
with
all
the
false
assumptions
that
go
with
it
there
is
at
least
one
absolutely
positive
way
to
disintegrate
such
a
situation
the
testimony
of
several
thousand
years
failure
of
our
various
educational
systems
indicates
that
there
are
quite
a
variety
of
lesser
ways
also
perhaps
you
are
aware
of
the
experiences
and
techniques
commonly
employed
on
earth
by
white
men
in
their
efforts
to
educate
the
aborigine
the
first
procedure
is
to
do
away
with
the
tribal
medicine
men
ignore
their
lore
and
learning
get
them
to
give
up
the
magic
words
and
their
pots
of
foul
smelling
liquids
abandon
their
ritual
dances
and
take
up
the
white
man
great
wisdom
we
have
done
this
time
after
time
only
to
learn
decades
later
that
the
natives
once
knew
much
of
anesthetics
and
healing
drugs
and
had
genuine
powers
to
communicate
in
ways
the
white
man
ca
duplicate
but
once
in
a
long
while
a
group
of
aborigines
show
more
spunk
than
the
average
they
refuse
to
give
up
their
medicine
men
their
magic
and
their
hard
earned
lore
accumulated
over
generations
and
centuries
instead
of
giving
these
things
up
they
insist
on
the
white
learning
these
mysteries
in
preference
to
nonsensical
and
ineffective
magic
they
completely
frustrate
the
situation
and
if
they
persist
they
finally
destroy
the
white
man
as
an
educator
he
is
forced
to
conclude
that
the
ignorant
savages
are
unteachable
it
is
an
infallible
technique
and
one
that
we
shall
employ
silvers
will
undertake
to
teach
his
mathematical
lecturer
in
the
approaches
to
the
legrandian
equations
he
will
speculate
long
and
noisily
on
the
geometry
which
potentially
lies
in
this
mathematical
system
carmen
will
elucidate
at
great
length
on
the
properties
of
the
chain
of
chemicals
he
has
been
advised
to
abandon
each
of
us
has
at
least
one
line
of
research
the
rykes
would
have
us
give
up
that
is
the
very
thing
we
shall
insist
on
having
investigated
we
shall
teach
them
these
things
and
prove
earthmen
to
be
an
unlearned
unteachable
band
of
aborigines
who
refuse
to
pursue
the
single
path
to
glory
and
light
but
insist
on
following
every
devious
byway
and
searching
every
darkness
that
lies
beside
the
path
it
ought
to
do
the
trick
i
estimate
it
should
not
be
more
than
a
week
before
we
are
on
our
way
back
home
labeled
by
the
rykes
as
utterly
hopeless
material
for
their
enlightenment
the
senators
seemed
momentarily
appalled
and
speechless
but
they
recovered
shortly
and
had
a
considerable
amount
of
high
flown
oratory
to
distribute
on
the
subject
the
scientists
however
were
comparatively
quiet
but
on
their
faces
was
a
subdued
glee
that
hockley
had
to
admit
was
little
short
of
fiendish
it
was
composed
he
thought
of
all
the
gloating
anticipations
of
all
the
schoolboys
who
had
ever
put
a
thumbtack
on
the
teacher
chair
hockley
was
somewhat
off
in
his
prediction
it
was
actually
a
mere
five
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
earthmen
campaign
that
the
rykes
gave
them
up
and
put
them
firmly
aboard
a
vessel
bound
for
home
the
rykes
were
apologetic
but
firm
in
admitting
they
had
made
a
sorry
mistake
that
earthmen
would
have
to
go
their
own
hopeless
way
while
the
rykes
led
the
rest
of
the
universe
toward
enlightenment
and
glory
hockley
showalter
and
silvers
watched
the
planet
drop
away
beneath
them
hockley
could
not
help
feeling
sympathetic
toward
the
rykes
i
wonder
what
will
happen
he
said
slowly
when
they
crash
headlong
into
an
impassable
barrier
on
that
beautiful
straight
road
of
theirs
i
wonder
if
they
ever
have
enough
guts
to
turn
aside
i
doubt
it
said
showalter
they
probably
curl
up
and
call
it
a
day
silvers
shook
his
head
as
if
to
ward
off
an
oppressive
vision
that
should
be
allowed
to
happen
he
said
they
got
too
much
achieved
too
much
in
spite
of
their
limitations
i
wonder
if
there
is
some
way
we
could
help
them
