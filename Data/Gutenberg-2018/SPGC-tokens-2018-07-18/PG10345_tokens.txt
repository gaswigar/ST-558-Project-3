first

in
chapter
entrance
of
the
mississippi
balize
on
the
of
november
i
sailed
from
london
accompanied
by
my
son
and
two
daughters
and
after
a
favourable
though
somewhat
tedious
voyage
arrived
on
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
the
first
indication
of
our
approach
to
land
was
the
appearance
of
this
mighty
river
pouring
forth
its
muddy
mass
of
waters
and
mingling
with
the
deep
blue
of
the
mexican
gulf
the
shores
of
this
river
are
so
utterly
flat
that
no
object
upon
them
is
perceptible
at
sea
and
we
gazed
with
pleasure
on
the
muddy
ocean
that
met
us
for
it
told
us
we
were
arrived
and
seven
weeks
of
sailing
had
wearied
us
yet
it
was
not
without
a
feeling
like
regret
that
we
passed
from
the
bright
blue
waves
whose
varying
aspect
had
so
long
furnished
our
chief
amusement
into
the
murky
stream
which
now
received
us
large
flights
of
pelicans
were
seen
standing
upon
the
long
masses
of
mud
which
rose
above
the
surface
of
the
waters
and
a
pilot
came
to
guide
us
over
the
bar
long
before
any
other
indication
of
land
was
visible
i
never
beheld
a
scene
so
utterly
desolate
as
this
entrance
of
the
mississippi
had
dante
seen
it
he
might
have
drawn
images
of
another
bolgia
from
its
horrors
one
only
object
rears
itself
above
the
eddying
waters
this
is
the
mast
of
a
vessel
long
since
wrecked
in
attempting
to
cross
the
bar
and
it
still
stands
a
dismal
witness
of
the
destruction
that
has
been
and
a
boding
prophet
of
that
which
is
to
come
by
degrees
bulrushes
of
enormous
growth
become
visible
and
a
few
more
miles
of
mud
brought
us
within
sight
of
a
cluster
of
huts
called
the
balize
by
far
the
most
miserable
station
that
i
ever
saw
made
the
dwelling
of
man
but
i
was
told
that
many
families
of
pilots
and
fishermen
lived
there
for
several
miles
above
its
mouth
the
mississippi
presents
no
objects
more
interesting
than
mud
banks
monstrous
bulrushes
and
now
and
then
a
huge
crocodile
luxuriating
in
the
slime
another
circumstance
that
gives
to
this
dreary
scene
an
aspect
of
desolation
is
the
incessant
appearance
of
vast
quantities
of
drift
wood
which
is
ever
finding
its
way
to
the
different
mouths
of
the
mississippi
trees
of
enormous
length
sometimes
still
bearing
their
branches
and
still
oftener
their
uptorn
roots
entire
the
victims
of
the
frequent
hurricane
come
floating
down
the
stream
sometimes
several
of
these
entangled
together
collect
among
their
boughs
a
quantity
of
floating
rubbish
that
gives
the
mass
the
appearance
of
a
moving
island
bearing
a
forest
with
its
roots
mocking
the
heavens
while
the
dishonoured
branches
lash
the
tide
in
idle
vengeance
this
as
it
approaches
the
vessel
and
glides
swiftly
past
looks
like
the
fragment
of
a
world
in
ruins
as
we
advanced
however
we
were
cheered
notwithstanding
the
season
by
the
bright
tints
of
southern
vegetation
the
banks
continue
invariably
flat
but
a
succession
of
planless
villas
sometimes
merely
a
residence
and
sometimes
surrounded
by
their
sugar
grounds
and
negro
huts
varied
the
scene
at
no
one
point
was
there
an
inch
of
what
painters
call
a
second
distance
and
for
the
length
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
the
balize
to
new
orleans
and
one
hundred
miles
above
the
town
the
land
is
defended
from
the
encroachments
of
the
river
by
a
high
embankment
which
is
called
the
levee
without
which
the
dwellings
would
speedily
disappear
as
the
river
is
evidently
higher
than
the
banks
would
be
without
it
when
we
arrived
there
had
been
constant
rains
and
of
long
continuance
and
this
appearance
was
therefore
unusually
striking
giving
to
this
great
natural
feature
the
most
unnatural
appearance
imaginable
and
making
evident
not
only
that
man
had
been
busy
there
but
that
even
the
mightiest
works
of
nature
might
be
made
to
bear
his
impress
it
recalled
literally
swift
mock
heroic
nature
must
give
way
to
art
yet
she
was
looking
so
mighty
and
so
unsubdued
all
the
time
that
i
could
not
help
fancying
she
would
some
day
take
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
again
and
if
so
farewell
to
new
orleans
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
total
want
of
beauty
in
such
a
landscape
but
yet
the
form
and
hue
of
the
trees
and
plants
so
new
to
us
added
to
the
long
privation
we
had
endured
of
all
sights
and
sounds
of
land
made
even
these
swampy
shores
seem
beautiful
we
were
however
impatient
to
touch
as
well
as
see
the
land
but
the
navigation
from
the
balize
to
new
orleans
is
difficult
and
tedious
and
the
two
days
that
it
occupied
appeared
longer
than
any
we
had
passed
on
board
in
truth
to
those
who
have
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
phenomena
of
nature
a
sea
voyage
may
endure
many
weeks
without
wearying
perhaps
some
may
think
that
the
first
glance
of
ocean
and
of
sky
shew
all
they
have
to
offer
nay
even
that
that
first
glance
may
suggest
more
of
dreariness
than
sublimity
but
to
me
their
variety
appeared
endless
and
their
beauty
unfailing
the
attempt
to
describe
scenery
even
where
the
objects
are
prominent
and
tangible
is
very
rarely
successful
but
where
the
effect
is
so
subtile
and
so
varying
it
must
be
vain
the
impression
nevertheless
is
perhaps
deeper
than
any
other
i
think
it
possible
i
may
forget
the
sensations
with
which
i
watched
the
long
course
of
the
gigantic
mississippi
the
ohio
and
the
potomac
may
mingle
and
be
confounded
with
other
streams
in
my
memory
i
may
even
recall
with
difficulty
the
blue
outline
of
the
alleghany
mountains
but
never
while
i
remember
any
thing
can
i
forget
the
first
and
last
hour
of
light
on
the
atlantic
the
ocean
however
and
all
its
indescribable
charm
no
longer
surrounded
us
we
began
to
feel
that
our
walk
on
the
was
very
like
the
exercise
of
an
ass
in
a
mill
that
our
books
had
lost
half
their
pages
and
that
the
other
half
were
known
by
rote
that
our
beef
was
very
salt
and
our
biscuits
very
hard
in
short
that
having
studied
the
good
ship
edward
from
stem
to
stern
till
we
knew
the
name
of
every
sail
and
the
use
of
every
pulley
we
had
had
enough
of
her
and
as
we
laid
down
head
to
head
in
our
tiny
beds
for
the
last
time
i
exclaimed
with
no
small
pleasure
tomorrow
to
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
chapter
new
orleans
society
creoles
and
quadroons
voyage
up
the
mississippi
on
first
touching
the
soil
of
a
new
land
of
a
new
continent
of
a
new
world
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
considerable
excitement
and
deep
interest
in
almost
every
object
that
meets
us
new
orleans
presents
very
little
that
can
gratify
the
eye
of
taste
but
nevertheless
there
is
much
of
novelty
and
interest
for
a
newly
arrived
european
the
large
proportion
of
blacks
seen
in
the
streets
all
labour
being
performed
by
them
the
grace
and
beauty
of
the
elegant
quadroons
the
occasional
groups
of
wild
and
savage
looking
indians
the
unwonted
aspect
of
the
vegetation
the
huge
and
turbid
river
with
its
low
and
slimy
shore
all
help
to
afford
that
species
of
amusement
which
proceeds
from
looking
at
what
we
never
saw
before
the
town
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
french
ville
de
province
and
is
in
fact
an
old
french
colony
taken
from
spain
by
france
the
names
of
the
streets
are
french
and
the
language
about
equally
french
and
english
the
market
is
handsome
and
well
supplied
all
produce
being
conveyed
by
the
river
we
were
much
pleased
by
the
chant
with
which
the
negro
boatmen
regulate
and
beguile
their
labour
on
the
river
it
consists
but
of
very
few
notes
but
they
are
sweetly
harmonious
and
the
negro
voice
is
almost
always
rich
and
powerful
by
far
the
most
agreeable
hours
i
passed
at
new
orleans
were
those
in
which
i
explored
with
my
children
the
forest
near
the
town
it
was
our
first
walk
in
the
eternal
forests
of
the
western
world
and
we
felt
rather
sublime
and
poetical
the
trees
generally
speaking
are
much
too
close
to
be
either
large
or
well
grown
and
moreover
their
growth
is
often
stunted
by
a
parasitical
plant
for
which
i
could
learn
no
other
name
than
spanish
moss
it
hangs
gracefully
from
the
boughs
converting
the
outline
of
all
the
trees
it
hangs
upon
into
that
of
weeping
willows
the
chief
beauty
of
the
forest
in
this
region
is
from
the
luxuriant
undergrowth
of
palmetos
which
is
decidedly
the
loveliest
coloured
and
most
graceful
plant
i
know
the
pawpaw
too
is
a
splendid
shrub
and
in
great
abundance
we
here
for
the
first
time
saw
the
wild
vine
which
we
afterwards
found
growing
so
profusely
in
every
part
of
america
as
naturally
to
suggest
the
idea
that
the
natives
ought
to
add
wine
to
the
numerous
production
of
their
soil
the
strong
pendant
festoons
made
safe
and
commodious
swings
which
some
of
our
party
enjoyed
despite
the
sublime
temperament
notwithstanding
it
was
when
we
were
at
new
orleans
the
heat
was
much
more
than
agreeable
and
the
attacks
of
the
mosquitos
incessant
and
most
tormenting
yet
i
suspect
that
for
a
short
time
we
would
rather
have
endured
it
than
not
have
seen
oranges
green
peas
and
red
pepper
growing
in
the
open
air
at
christmas
in
one
of
our
rambles
we
ventured
to
enter
a
garden
whose
bright
orange
hedge
attracted
our
attention
here
we
saw
green
peas
fit
for
the
table
and
a
fine
crop
of
red
pepper
ripening
in
the
sun
a
young
negress
was
employed
on
the
steps
of
the
house
that
she
was
a
slave
made
her
an
object
of
interest
to
us
she
was
the
first
slave
we
had
ever
spoken
to
and
i
believe
we
all
felt
that
we
could
hardly
address
her
with
sufficient
gentleness
she
little
dreamed
poor
girl
what
deep
sympathy
she
excited
she
answered
us
civilly
and
gaily
and
seemed
amused
at
our
fancying
there
was
something
unusual
in
red
pepper
pods
she
gave
us
several
of
them
and
i
felt
fearful
lest
a
hard
mistress
might
blame
her
for
it
how
very
childish
does
ignorance
make
us
and
how
very
ignorant
we
are
upon
almost
every
subject
where
hearsay
evidence
is
all
we
can
get
i
left
england
with
feelings
so
strongly
opposed
to
slavery
that
it
was
not
without
pain
i
witnessed
its
effects
around
me
at
the
sight
of
every
negro
man
woman
and
child
that
passed
my
fancy
wove
some
little
romance
of
misery
as
belonging
to
each
of
them
since
i
have
known
more
on
the
subject
and
become
better
acquainted
with
their
real
situation
in
america
i
have
often
smiled
at
recalling
what
i
then
felt
the
first
symptom
of
american
equality
that
i
perceived
was
my
being
introduced
in
form
to
a
milliner
it
was
not
at
a
under
the
indistinct
outline
of
miss
c
nor
in
the
street
through
the
veil
of
a
fashionable
toilette
but
in
the
very
penetralia
of
her
temple
standing
behind
her
counter
giving
laws
to
ribbon
and
to
wire
and
ushering
caps
and
bonnets
into
existence
she
was
an
english
woman
and
i
was
told
that
she
possessed
great
intellectual
endowments
and
much
information
i
really
believe
this
was
true
her
manner
was
easy
and
graceful
with
a
good
deal
of
french
tournure
and
the
gentleness
with
which
her
fine
eyes
and
sweet
voice
directed
the
movements
of
a
young
female
slave
was
really
touching
the
way
too
in
which
she
blended
her
french
talk
of
modes
with
her
customers
and
her
english
talk
of
metaphysics
with
her
friends
had
a
pretty
air
of
indifference
in
it
that
gave
her
a
superiority
with
both
i
found
with
her
the
daughter
of
a
judge
eminent
it
was
said
both
for
legal
and
literary
ability
and
i
heard
from
many
quarters
after
i
had
left
new
orleans
that
the
society
of
this
lady
was
highly
valued
by
all
persons
of
talent
yet
were
i
to
stop
here
and
set
it
down
as
a
national
peculiarity
or
republican
custom
that
milliners
took
the
lead
in
the
best
society
i
should
greatly
falsify
facts
i
do
not
remember
the
same
thing
happening
to
me
again
and
this
is
one
instance
among
a
thousand
of
the
impression
every
circumstance
makes
on
entering
a
new
country
and
of
the
propensity
so
irresistible
to
class
all
things
however
accidental
as
national
and
peculiar
on
the
other
hand
however
it
is
certain
that
if
similar
anomalies
are
unfrequent
in
america
they
are
nearly
impossible
elsewhere
in
the
shop
of
miss
c
i
was
introduced
to
a
venerable
personage
of
gentlemanlike
appearance
who
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
propounded
as
many
axioms
as
ignorance
is
the
only
devil
man
makes
his
own
existence
and
the
like
he
was
of
the
new
harmony
school
or
rather
the
new
harmony
school
was
of
him
he
was
a
man
of
good
fortune
a
scotchman
i
believe
who
after
living
a
tolerably
gay
life
had
conceived
high
thoughts
such
as
lycurgus
loved
who
bade
flog
the
little
spartans
and
determined
to
benefit
the
species
and
immortalize
himself
by
founding
a
philosophical
school
at
new
harmony
there
was
something
in
the
hollow
square
legislations
of
owen
that
struck
him
as
admirable
and
he
seems
as
far
as
i
can
understand
to
have
intended
aiding
his
views
by
a
sort
of
incipient
hollow
square
drilling
teaching
the
young
ideas
of
all
he
could
catch
to
shoot
into
parallelogramic
form
and
order
this
venerable
philosopher
like
all
of
his
school
that
i
ever
heard
of
loved
better
to
originate
lofty
imaginings
of
faultless
systems
than
to
watch
their
application
to
practice
with
much
liberality
he
purchased
and
conveyed
to
the
wilderness
a
very
noble
collection
of
books
and
scientific
instruments
but
not
finding
among
men
one
whose
views
were
liberal
and
enlarged
as
his
own
he
selected
a
woman
to
put
into
action
the
machine
he
had
organized
as
his
acquaintance
with
this
lady
had
been
of
long
standing
and
as
it
was
said
very
intimate
he
felt
sure
that
no
violation
of
his
rules
would
have
place
under
her
sway
they
would
act
together
as
one
being
he
was
to
perform
the
functions
of
the
soul
and
will
everything
she
those
of
the
body
and
perform
everything
the
principal
feature
of
the
scheme
was
that
the
first
liberal
outfit
of
the
institution
having
been
furnished
by
the
expense
of
keeping
it
up
should
be
defrayed
by
the
profits
arising
from
the
labours
of
the
pupils
male
and
female
which
was
to
be
performed
at
stated
intervals
of
each
day
in
regular
rotation
with
learned
study
and
scientific
research
but
unfortunately
the
soul
of
the
system
found
the
climate
of
indiana
uncongenial
to
its
peculiar
formation
and
therefore
took
its
flight
to
mexico
leaving
the
body
to
perform
the
operations
of
both
in
whatever
manner
it
liked
best
and
the
body
being
a
french
body
found
no
difficulty
in
setting
actively
to
work
without
troubling
the
soul
about
it
and
soon
becoming
conscious
that
the
more
simple
was
a
machine
the
more
perfect
were
its
operations
she
threw
out
all
that
related
to
the
intellectual
part
of
the
business
which
to
do
poor
soul
justice
it
had
laid
great
stress
upon
and
stirred
herself
as
effectually
as
ever
body
did
to
draw
wealth
from
the
thews
and
sinews
of
the
youths
they
had
collected
when
last
i
heard
of
this
philosophical
establishment
she
and
a
were
said
to
be
reaping
a
golden
harvest
as
many
of
the
lads
had
been
sent
from
a
distance
by
indigent
parents
for
gratuitous
education
and
possessed
no
means
of
leaving
it
our
stay
in
new
orleans
was
not
long
enough
to
permit
our
entering
into
society
but
i
was
told
that
it
contained
two
distinct
sets
of
people
both
celebrated
in
their
way
for
their
social
meetings
and
elegant
entertainments
the
first
of
these
is
composed
of
creole
families
who
are
chiefly
planters
and
merchants
with
their
wives
and
daughters
these
meet
together
eat
together
and
are
very
grand
and
aristocratic
each
of
their
balls
is
a
little
almack
and
every
portly
dame
of
the
set
is
as
exclusive
in
her
principles
as
the
excluded
but
amiable
quandroons
and
such
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
former
class
as
can
by
any
means
escape
from
the
high
places
where
pure
creole
blood
swells
the
veins
at
the
bare
mention
of
any
being
tainted
in
the
remotest
degree
with
the
negro
stain
of
all
the
prejudices
i
have
ever
witnessed
this
appears
to
me
the
most
violent
and
the
most
inveterate
quadroon
girls
the
acknowledged
daughters
of
wealthy
american
or
creole
fathers
educated
with
all
of
style
and
accomplishments
which
money
can
procure
at
new
orleans
and
with
all
the
decorum
that
care
and
affection
can
give
exquisitely
beautiful
graceful
gentle
and
amiable
these
are
not
admitted
nay
are
not
on
any
terms
admissable
into
the
society
of
the
creole
families
of
louisiana
they
can
not
marry
that
is
to
say
no
ceremony
can
render
an
union
with
them
legal
or
binding
yet
such
is
the
powerful
effect
of
their
very
peculiar
grace
beauty
and
sweetness
of
manner
that
unfortunately
they
perpetually
become
the
objects
of
choice
and
affection
if
the
creole
ladies
have
privilege
to
exercise
the
awful
power
of
repulsion
the
gentle
quadroon
has
the
sweet
but
dangerous
vengeance
of
possessing
that
of
attraction
the
unions
formed
with
this
unfortunate
race
are
said
to
be
often
lasting
and
happy
as
far
as
any
unions
can
be
so
to
which
a
certain
degree
of
disgrace
is
attached
there
is
a
french
and
an
english
theatre
in
the
town
but
we
were
too
fresh
from
europe
to
care
much
for
either
or
indeed
for
any
other
of
the
town
delights
of
this
city
and
we
soon
became
eager
to
commence
our
voyage
up
the
mississippi
miss
wright
then
less
known
though
the
author
of
more
than
one
clever
volume
than
she
has
since
become
was
the
companion
of
our
voyage
from
europe
and
it
was
my
purpose
to
have
passed
some
months
with
her
and
her
sister
at
the
estate
she
had
purchased
in
tennessee
this
lady
since
become
so
celebrated
as
the
advocate
of
opinions
that
make
millions
shudder
and
some
admire
was
at
the
time
of
my
leaving
england
with
her
dedicated
to
a
pursuit
widely
different
from
her
subsequent
occupations
instead
of
becoming
a
public
orator
in
every
town
throughout
america
she
was
about
as
she
said
to
seclude
herself
for
life
in
the
deepest
forests
of
the
western
world
that
her
fortune
her
time
and
her
talents
might
be
exclusively
devoted
to
aid
the
cause
of
the
suffering
africans
her
first
object
was
to
shew
that
nature
had
made
no
difference
between
blacks
and
whites
excepting
in
complexion
and
this
she
expected
to
prove
by
giving
an
education
perfectly
equal
to
a
class
of
black
and
white
children
could
this
fact
be
once
fully
established
she
conceived
that
the
negro
cause
would
stand
on
firmer
ground
than
it
had
yet
done
and
the
degraded
rank
which
they
have
ever
held
amongst
civilized
nations
would
be
proved
to
be
a
gross
injustice
this
question
of
the
mental
equality
or
inequality
between
us
and
the
negro
race
is
one
of
great
interest
and
has
certainly
never
yet
been
fairly
tried
and
i
expected
for
my
children
and
myself
both
pleasure
and
information
from
visiting
her
establishment
and
watching
the
success
of
her
experiment
the
innumerable
steam
boats
which
are
the
stage
coaches
and
fly
waggons
of
this
land
of
lakes
and
rivers
are
totally
unlike
any
i
had
seen
in
europe
and
greatly
superior
to
them
the
fabrics
which
i
think
they
most
resemble
in
appearance
are
the
floating
baths
les
bains
vigier
at
paris
the
annexed
drawing
will
give
a
correct
idea
of
their
form
the
room
to
which
the
double
line
of
windows
belongs
is
a
very
handsome
apartment
before
each
window
a
neat
little
cot
is
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
its
drapery
the
air
of
a
window
curtain
this
room
is
called
the
gentlemen
cabin
and
their
exclusive
right
to
it
is
somewhat
uncourteously
insisted
upon
the
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
are
laid
in
this
apartment
and
the
lady
passengers
are
permitted
to
take
their
meals
there
on
the
first
of
january
we
embarked
on
board
the
belvidere
a
large
and
handsome
boat
though
not
the
largest
or
handsomest
of
the
many
which
displayed
themselves
along
the
wharfs
but
she
was
going
to
stop
at
memphis
the
point
of
the
river
nearest
to
miss
wright
residence
and
she
was
the
first
that
departed
after
we
had
got
through
the
customhouse
and
finished
our
we
found
the
room
destined
for
the
use
of
the
ladies
dismal
enough
as
its
only
windows
were
below
the
stem
gallery
but
both
this
and
the
gentlemen
cabin
were
handsomely
fitted
up
and
the
former
well
carpeted
but
oh
that
carpet
i
will
not
i
may
not
describe
its
condition
indeed
it
requires
the
pen
of
a
swift
to
do
it
justice
let
no
one
who
wishes
to
receive
agreeable
impressions
of
american
manners
commence
their
travels
in
a
mississippi
steam
boat
for
myself
it
is
with
all
sincerity
i
declare
that
i
would
infinitely
prefer
sharing
the
apartment
of
a
party
of
well
conditioned
pigs
to
the
being
confined
to
its
cabin
i
hardly
know
any
annoyance
so
deeply
repugnant
to
english
feelings
as
the
incessant
remorseless
spitting
of
americans
i
feel
that
i
owe
my
readers
an
apology
for
the
repeated
use
of
this
and
several
other
odious
words
but
i
can
not
avoid
them
without
suffering
the
fidelity
of
description
to
escape
me
it
is
possible
that
in
this
phrase
americans
i
may
be
too
general
the
united
states
form
a
continent
of
almost
distinct
nations
and
i
must
now
and
always
be
understood
to
speak
only
of
that
portion
of
them
which
i
have
seen
in
conversing
with
americans
i
have
constantly
found
that
if
i
alluded
to
anything
which
they
thought
i
considered
as
uncouth
they
would
assure
me
it
was
local
and
not
national
the
accidental
peculiarity
of
a
very
small
part
and
by
no
means
a
specimen
of
the
whole
that
is
because
you
know
so
little
of
america
is
a
phrase
i
have
listened
to
a
thousand
times
and
in
nearly
as
many
different
places
may
be
and
having
made
this
concession
i
protest
against
the
charge
of
injustice
in
relating
what
i
have
seen
chapter
company
on
board
the
steam
boat
scenery
of
the
mississippi
crocodiles
arrival
at
memphis
nashoba
the
weather
was
warm
and
bright
and
we
found
the
guard
of
the
boat
as
they
call
the
gallery
that
runs
round
the
cabins
a
very
agreeable
station
here
we
all
sat
as
long
as
light
lasted
and
sometimes
wrapped
in
our
shawls
we
enjoyed
the
clear
bright
beauty
of
american
moonlight
long
after
every
passenger
but
ourselves
had
retired
we
had
a
full
complement
of
passengers
on
board
the
deck
as
is
usual
was
occupied
by
the
kentucky
men
returning
from
new
orleans
after
having
disposed
of
the
boat
and
cargo
which
they
had
conveyed
thither
with
no
other
labour
than
that
of
steering
her
the
current
bringing
her
down
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
we
had
about
two
hundred
of
these
men
on
board
but
the
part
of
the
vessel
occupied
by
them
is
so
distinct
from
the
cabins
that
we
never
saw
them
except
when
we
stopped
to
take
in
wood
and
then
they
ran
or
rather
sprung
and
vaulted
over
each
other
heads
to
the
shore
whence
they
all
assisted
in
carrying
wood
to
supply
the
steam
engine
the
performance
of
this
duty
being
a
stipulated
part
of
the
payment
of
their
passage
from
the
account
given
by
a
man
servant
we
had
on
board
who
shared
their
quarters
they
are
a
most
disorderly
set
of
persons
constantly
gambling
and
wrangling
very
seldom
sober
and
never
suffering
a
night
to
pass
without
giving
practical
proof
of
the
respect
in
which
they
hold
the
doctrines
of
equality
and
community
of
property
the
clerk
of
the
vessel
was
kind
enough
to
take
our
man
under
his
protection
and
assigned
him
a
berth
in
his
own
little
nook
but
as
this
was
not
inaccessible
he
told
him
by
no
means
to
detach
his
watch
or
money
from
his
person
during
the
night
whatever
their
moral
characteristics
may
be
these
kentuckians
are
a
very
race
of
men
their
average
height
considerably
exceeds
that
of
europeans
and
their
countenances
excepting
when
disfigured
by
red
hair
which
is
not
unfrequent
extremely
handsome
the
gentlemen
in
the
cabin
we
had
no
ladies
would
certainly
neither
from
their
language
manners
nor
appearance
have
received
that
designation
in
europe
but
we
soon
found
their
claim
to
it
rested
on
more
substantial
ground
for
we
heard
them
nearly
all
addressed
by
the
titles
of
general
colonel
and
major
on
mentioning
these
military
dignities
to
an
english
friend
some
time
afterwards
he
told
me
that
he
too
had
made
the
voyage
with
the
same
description
of
company
but
remarking
that
there
was
not
a
single
captain
among
them
he
made
the
observation
to
a
and
asked
how
he
accounted
for
it
oh
sir
the
captains
are
all
on
deck
was
the
reply
our
honours
however
were
not
all
military
for
we
had
a
judge
among
us
i
know
it
is
equally
easy
and
invidious
to
ridicule
the
peculiarities
of
appearance
and
manner
in
people
of
a
different
nation
from
ourselves
we
may
too
at
the
same
moment
be
undergoing
the
same
ordeal
in
their
estimation
and
moreover
i
am
by
no
means
disposed
to
consider
whatever
is
new
to
me
as
therefore
objectionable
but
nevertheless
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
repugnance
to
many
of
the
novelties
that
now
surrounded
me
the
total
want
of
all
the
usual
courtesies
of
the
table
the
voracious
rapidity
with
which
the
viands
were
seized
and
devoured
the
strange
uncouth
phrases
and
pronunciation
the
loathsome
spitting
from
the
contamination
of
which
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
protect
our
dresses
the
frightful
manner
of
feeding
with
their
knives
till
the
whole
blade
seemed
to
enter
into
the
mouth
and
the
still
more
frightful
manner
of
cleaning
the
teeth
afterwards
with
a
pocket
knife
soon
forced
us
to
feel
that
we
were
not
surrounded
by
the
generals
colonels
and
majors
of
the
old
world
and
that
the
dinner
hour
was
to
be
any
thing
rather
than
an
hour
of
enjoyment
the
little
conversation
that
went
forward
while
we
remained
in
the
room
was
entirely
political
and
the
respective
claims
of
adams
and
jackson
to
the
presidency
were
argued
with
more
oaths
and
more
vehemence
than
it
had
ever
been
my
lot
to
hear
once
a
colonel
appeared
on
the
verge
of
assaulting
a
major
when
a
huge
kentuckian
gentleman
asked
of
the
heavens
to
confound
them
both
and
bade
them
sit
still
and
be
d
we
too
thought
we
should
share
this
sentence
at
least
sitting
still
in
the
cabin
seemed
very
nearly
to
include
the
rest
of
it
and
we
never
tarried
there
a
moment
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
eat
the
unbroken
flatness
of
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
continued
unvaried
for
many
miles
above
new
orleans
but
the
graceful
and
luxuriant
palmetto
the
dark
and
noble
ilex
and
the
bright
orange
were
every
where
to
be
seen
and
it
was
many
days
before
we
were
weary
of
looking
at
them
we
occasionally
used
the
opportunity
of
the
boat
stopping
to
take
in
wood
for
a
ten
minutes
visit
to
the
shore
we
in
this
manner
explored
a
field
of
sugar
canes
and
loaded
ourselves
with
as
much
of
the
sweet
spoil
as
we
could
carry
many
of
the
passengers
seemed
fond
of
the
luscious
juice
that
is
easily
expressed
from
the
canes
but
it
was
too
sweet
for
my
palate
we
also
visited
in
the
same
rapid
manner
a
cotton
plantation
a
handsome
spacious
building
was
pointed
out
to
us
as
a
convent
where
a
considerable
number
of
young
ladies
were
educated
by
the
nuns
at
one
or
two
points
the
wearisome
level
line
of
forest
is
relieved
by
as
they
call
the
short
intervals
of
high
ground
the
town
of
natches
is
beautifully
situated
on
one
of
these
high
spots
the
climate
here
in
the
warm
season
is
as
fatal
as
that
of
new
orleans
were
it
not
for
this
natches
would
have
great
attractions
to
new
settlers
the
beautiful
contrast
that
its
bright
green
hill
forms
with
the
dismal
line
of
black
forest
that
stretches
on
every
side
the
abundant
growth
of
pawpaw
palmetto
and
orange
the
copious
variety
of
flowers
that
flourish
there
all
make
it
appear
like
an
oasis
in
the
desert
natches
is
the
furthest
point
to
the
north
at
which
oranges
ripen
in
the
open
air
or
endure
the
winter
without
shelter
with
the
exception
of
this
sweet
spot
i
thought
all
the
little
towns
and
villages
we
passed
wretched
looking
in
the
extreme
as
the
distance
from
new
orleans
increased
the
air
of
wealth
and
comfort
exhibited
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
disappeared
and
but
for
one
or
two
clusters
of
wooden
houses
calling
themselves
towns
and
borrowing
some
pompous
name
generally
from
greece
or
rome
we
might
have
thought
ourselves
the
first
of
the
human
race
who
had
ever
penetrated
into
this
territory
of
bears
and
alligators
but
still
from
time
to
time
appeared
the
hut
of
the
who
supplies
the
with
fuel
at
the
risk
or
rather
with
the
assurance
of
early
death
in
exchange
for
dollars
and
whiskey
these
sad
dwellings
are
nearly
all
of
them
inundated
during
the
winter
and
the
best
of
them
are
constructed
on
piles
which
permit
the
water
to
reach
its
highest
level
without
drowning
the
wretched
inhabitants
these
unhappy
beings
are
invariably
the
victims
of
ague
which
they
meet
recklessly
sustained
by
the
incessant
use
of
ardent
spirits
the
squalid
look
of
the
miserable
wives
and
children
of
these
men
was
dreadful
and
often
as
the
spectacle
was
renewed
i
could
never
look
at
it
with
indifference
their
complexion
is
of
a
blueish
white
that
suggests
the
idea
of
dropsy
this
is
invariable
and
the
poor
little
ones
wear
exactly
the
same
ghastly
hue
a
miserable
cow
and
a
few
pigs
standing
in
water
distinguish
the
more
prosperous
of
these
dwellings
and
on
the
whole
i
should
say
that
i
never
witnessed
human
nature
reduced
so
low
as
it
appeared
in
the
huts
on
the
unwholesome
banks
of
the
mississippi
it
is
said
that
at
some
points
of
this
dismal
river
crocodiles
are
so
abundant
as
to
add
the
terror
of
their
attacks
to
the
other
sufferings
of
a
dwelling
there
we
were
told
a
story
of
a
squatter
who
having
located
himself
close
to
the
edge
proceeded
to
build
his
cabin
this
operation
is
soon
performed
for
social
feeling
and
the
love
of
whiskey
bring
all
the
scanty
neighbourhood
round
a
new
corner
to
aid
him
in
cutting
down
trees
and
in
rolling
up
the
logs
till
the
mansion
is
complete
this
was
done
the
wife
and
five
young
children
were
put
in
possession
of
their
new
home
and
slept
soundly
after
a
long
march
towards
daybreak
the
husband
and
father
was
awakened
by
a
faint
cry
and
looking
up
beheld
relics
of
three
of
his
children
scattered
over
the
floor
and
an
enormous
crocodile
with
several
young
ones
around
her
occupied
in
devouring
the
remnants
of
their
horrid
meal
he
looked
round
for
a
weapon
but
finding
none
and
aware
that
unarmed
he
could
do
nothing
he
raised
himself
gently
on
his
bed
and
contrived
to
crawl
from
thence
through
a
window
hoping
that
his
wife
whom
he
left
sleeping
might
with
the
remaining
children
rest
undiscovered
till
his
return
he
flew
to
his
nearest
neighbour
and
besought
his
aid
in
less
than
half
an
hour
two
men
returned
with
him
all
three
well
armed
but
alas
they
were
too
late
the
wife
and
her
two
babes
lay
mangled
on
their
bloody
bed
the
gorged
reptiles
fell
an
easy
prey
to
their
assailants
who
upon
examining
the
place
found
the
hut
had
been
constructed
close
to
the
mouth
of
a
large
hole
almost
a
cavern
where
the
monster
had
hatched
her
hateful
brood
among
other
sights
of
desolation
which
mark
this
region
condemned
of
nature
the
lurid
glare
of
a
burning
forest
was
almost
constantly
visible
after
sunset
and
when
the
wind
so
willed
the
smoke
arising
from
it
floated
in
heavy
vapour
over
our
heads
not
all
the
novelty
of
the
scene
not
all
its
vastness
could
prevent
its
heavy
horror
wearying
the
spirits
perhaps
the
dinners
and
suppers
i
have
described
may
help
to
account
for
this
but
certain
it
is
that
when
we
had
wondered
for
a
week
at
the
ceaseless
continuity
of
forest
had
first
admired
and
then
wearied
of
the
festooned
drapery
of
spanish
moss
when
we
had
learned
to
distinguish
the
different
masses
of
timber
that
passed
us
or
that
we
passed
as
a
snag
a
log
or
a
sawyer
when
we
had
finally
made
up
our
minds
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
kentucky
and
ohio
military
establishments
were
not
of
the
same
genus
as
those
of
the
tuilleries
and
james
we
began
to
wish
that
we
could
sleep
more
hours
away
as
we
advanced
to
the
northward
we
were
no
longer
cheered
by
the
beautiful
border
of
palmettos
and
even
the
amusement
of
occasionally
spying
out
a
sleeping
crocodile
was
over
just
in
this
state
when
we
would
have
fain
believed
that
every
mile
we
went
carried
us
two
towards
memphis
a
sudden
and
violent
shock
startled
us
frightfully
it
is
a
sawyer
said
one
it
is
a
snag
cried
another
we
are
aground
exclaimed
the
captain
aground
good
heavens
and
how
long
shall
we
stay
here
the
lord
in
his
providence
can
only
tell
but
long
enough
to
tire
my
patience
i
expect
and
the
poor
english
ladies
how
fared
they
the
while
two
breakfasts
two
dinners
and
a
supper
did
they
eat
with
the
ohio
and
kentucky
gentlemen
before
they
moved
an
inch
several
passed
while
we
were
thus
enthralled
but
some
were
not
strong
enough
to
attempt
drawing
us
off
and
some
attempted
it
but
were
not
strong
enough
to
succeed
at
length
a
vast
and
mighty
thing
of
life
approached
threw
out
grappling
irons
and
in
three
minutes
the
business
was
done
again
we
saw
the
trees
and
mud
slide
swiftly
past
us
and
a
hearty
shout
from
every
passenger
on
deck
declared
their
joy
at
length
we
had
the
pleasure
of
being
told
that
we
had
arrived
at
memphis
but
this
pleasure
was
considerably
abated
by
the
hour
of
our
arrival
which
was
midnight
and
by
the
rain
which
was
falling
in
torrents
memphis
stands
on
a
high
bluff
and
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
was
nearly
inaccessible
the
heavy
rain
which
had
been
falling
for
many
hours
would
have
made
any
steep
ascent
difficult
but
unfortunately
a
new
road
had
been
recently
marked
out
which
beguiled
us
into
its
almost
bottomless
mud
from
the
firmer
footing
of
the
unbroken
cliff
shoes
and
gloves
were
lost
in
the
mire
for
we
were
glad
to
avail
ourselves
of
all
our
limbs
and
we
reached
the
grand
hotel
in
a
most
deplorable
state
miss
wright
was
well
known
there
and
as
soon
as
her
arrival
was
announced
every
one
seemed
on
the
alert
to
receive
her
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
possession
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
hotel
the
house
was
new
and
in
what
appeared
to
me
a
very
comfortless
condition
but
i
was
then
new
to
western
america
and
unaccustomed
to
their
mode
of
getting
along
as
they
term
it
this
phrase
is
eternally
in
use
among
them
and
seems
to
mean
existing
with
as
few
of
the
comforts
of
life
as
possible
we
slept
soundly
however
and
rose
in
the
hope
of
soon
changing
our
for
miss
wright
nashoba
but
we
presently
found
that
the
rain
which
had
fallen
during
the
night
would
make
it
hazardous
to
venture
through
the
forests
of
tennessee
in
any
sort
of
carriage
we
therefore
had
to
pass
the
day
at
our
queer
comfortless
hotel
the
had
wearied
me
of
social
meals
and
i
should
have
been
thankful
to
have
eaten
our
dinner
of
hard
venison
and
in
a
private
room
but
this
miss
wright
said
was
impossible
the
lady
of
the
house
would
consider
the
proposal
as
a
personal
affront
and
moreover
it
would
be
assuredly
refused
this
latter
argument
carried
weight
with
it
and
when
the
great
bell
was
sounded
from
an
upper
window
of
the
house
we
proceeded
to
the
the
table
was
laid
for
fifty
persons
and
was
already
nearly
full
our
party
had
the
honour
of
sitting
near
the
lady
but
to
check
the
proud
feelings
to
which
such
distinction
might
give
birth
my
servant
william
sat
very
nearly
opposite
to
me
the
company
consisted
of
all
the
as
they
are
called
throughout
the
united
states
of
the
little
town
the
mayor
also
who
was
a
friend
of
miss
wright
was
of
the
party
he
is
a
pleasing
gentlemanlike
man
and
seems
strangely
misplaced
in
a
little
town
on
the
mississippi
we
were
told
that
since
the
erection
of
this
hotel
it
has
been
the
custom
for
all
the
male
inhabitants
of
the
town
to
dine
and
breakfast
there
they
ate
in
perfect
silence
and
with
such
astonishing
rapidity
that
their
dinner
was
over
literally
before
our
was
began
the
instant
they
ceased
to
eat
they
darted
from
the
table
in
the
same
moody
silence
which
they
had
preserved
since
they
entered
the
room
and
a
second
set
took
their
places
who
performed
their
silent
parts
in
the
same
manner
the
only
sounds
heard
were
those
produced
by
the
knives
and
forks
with
the
unceasing
chorus
of
coughing
no
women
were
present
except
ourselves
and
the
hostess
the
good
women
of
memphis
being
well
content
to
let
their
lords
partake
of
anderson
turkeys
and
venison
without
their
having
the
trouble
of
cooking
for
them
whilst
they
regale
themselves
on
mash
and
milk
at
home
the
remainder
of
the
day
passed
pleasantly
enough
in
rambling
round
the
little
town
which
is
situated
at
the
most
beautiful
point
of
the
mississippi
the
river
is
here
so
wide
as
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
noble
lake
an
island
covered
with
lofty
forest
trees
divides
it
and
relieves
by
its
broad
mass
of
shadow
the
uniformity
of
its
waters
the
town
stretches
in
a
rambling
irregular
manner
along
the
cliff
from
the
wolf
river
one
of
the
innumerable
tributaries
to
the
mississippi
to
about
a
mile
below
it
half
a
mile
more
of
the
cliff
beyond
the
town
is
cleared
of
trees
and
produces
good
pasture
for
horses
cows
and
pigs
sheep
they
had
none
at
either
end
of
this
space
the
forest
again
rears
its
dark
wall
and
seems
to
say
to
man
so
far
shalt
thou
come
and
no
farther
courage
and
industry
however
have
braved
the
warning
behind
this
long
street
the
town
straggles
back
into
the
forest
and
the
rude
path
that
leads
to
the
more
distant
log
dwellings
becomes
wilder
at
every
step
the
ground
is
broken
by
frequent
and
the
bridges
that
lead
across
them
are
formed
by
trunks
of
trees
thrown
over
the
stream
which
support
others
of
smaller
growth
that
are
laid
across
them
these
bridges
are
not
very
pleasant
to
pass
for
they
totter
under
the
tread
of
a
man
and
tremble
most
frightfully
beneath
a
horse
or
a
waggon
they
are
however
very
picturesque
the
great
height
of
the
trees
the
quantity
of
pendant
vine
branches
that
hang
amongst
them
and
the
variety
of
gay
plumaged
birds
particularly
the
small
green
parrot
made
us
feel
we
were
in
a
new
world
and
a
repetition
of
our
walk
the
next
morning
would
have
pleased
us
well
but
miss
wright
was
anxious
to
get
home
and
we
were
scarcely
less
so
to
see
her
nashoba
a
clumsy
sort
of
caravan
drawn
by
two
horses
was
prepared
for
us
and
we
set
off
in
high
spirits
for
an
expedition
of
fifteen
miles
through
the
forest
to
avoid
passing
one
of
the
bridges
above
described
which
was
thought
insecure
our
negro
driver
took
us
through
a
piece
of
water
which
he
assured
us
was
not
deep
to
matter
however
we
soon
lost
sight
of
our
pole
and
as
we
were
evidently
descending
we
gently
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
danger
of
proceeding
but
he
only
grinned
and
flogged
in
reply
we
soon
saw
the
front
wheels
disappear
and
horses
began
to
plunge
and
kick
most
alarmingly
but
still
without
his
looking
at
all
disturbed
at
length
the
gave
way
upon
which
the
black
philosopher
said
very
composedly
i
expect
you
best
be
riding
out
upon
the
horses
as
we
got
into
an
unhandsome
fix
here
miss
wright
who
sat
composedly
smiling
at
the
scene
said
yes
jacob
that
is
what
we
must
do
and
with
some
difficulty
we
in
this
manner
reached
the
shore
and
soon
found
ourselves
again
assembled
round
anderson
fire
it
was
soon
settled
that
we
must
delay
our
departure
till
the
waters
had
subsided
but
miss
wright
was
too
anxious
to
reach
home
to
endure
this
delay
and
she
set
off
again
on
horseback
accompanied
by
our
man
servant
who
told
me
afterwards
that
they
rode
through
places
that
might
have
daunted
the
boldest
hunter
but
that
miss
wright
took
it
quite
easy
the
next
day
we
started
again
and
the
clear
air
the
bright
sun
the
novel
wildness
of
the
dark
forest
and
our
keenly
awakened
curiosity
made
the
excursion
delightful
and
enabled
us
to
bear
without
shrinking
the
bumps
and
bruises
we
encountered
we
soon
lost
all
trace
of
a
road
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
us
for
the
stumps
of
the
trees
which
had
been
cut
away
to
open
a
passage
were
left
standing
three
feet
high
over
these
the
deerborn
as
our
carriage
was
called
passed
safely
but
it
required
some
miles
of
experience
to
convince
us
that
every
stump
would
not
be
our
last
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
cool
and
easy
skill
with
which
the
driver
wound
his
horses
and
wheels
among
these
stumps
i
thought
he
might
have
been
imported
to
bond
street
with
great
advantage
the
forest
became
thicker
and
more
every
mile
we
advanced
but
our
negro
declared
it
was
a
right
good
road
and
that
we
should
be
sure
to
get
to
nashoba
and
so
we
did
one
glance
sufficed
to
convince
me
that
every
idea
i
had
formed
of
the
place
was
as
far
as
possible
from
the
truth
desolation
was
the
only
feeling
the
only
word
that
presented
itself
but
it
was
not
spoken
i
think
however
that
miss
wright
was
aware
of
the
painful
impression
the
sight
of
her
forest
home
produced
on
me
and
i
doubt
not
that
the
conviction
reached
us
both
at
the
same
moment
that
we
had
erred
in
thinking
that
a
few
months
passed
together
at
this
spot
could
be
productive
of
pleasure
to
either
but
to
do
her
justice
i
believe
her
mind
was
so
exclusively
occupied
by
the
object
she
had
then
in
view
that
all
things
else
were
worthless
or
indifferent
to
her
i
never
heard
or
read
of
any
enthusiasm
approaching
her
except
in
some
few
instances
in
ages
past
of
religious
fanaticism
it
must
have
been
some
feeling
equally
powerful
which
enabled
miss
wright
accustomed
to
all
the
comfort
and
refinement
of
europe
to
imagine
not
only
that
she
herself
could
exist
in
this
wilderness
but
that
her
european
friends
could
enter
there
and
not
feel
dismayed
at
the
savage
aspect
of
the
scene
the
annexed
plate
gives
a
faithful
view
of
the
cleared
space
and
buildings
which
form
the
settlement
each
building
consisted
of
two
large
rooms
furnished
in
the
most
simple
manner
nor
had
they
as
yet
collected
round
them
any
of
those
minor
comforts
which
ordinary
minds
class
among
the
necessaries
of
life
but
in
this
our
philosophical
friend
seemed
to
see
no
evil
nor
was
there
any
mixture
of
affectation
in
this
indifference
it
was
a
circumstance
really
and
truly
beneath
her
notice
her
whole
heart
and
soul
were
occupied
by
the
hope
of
raising
the
african
to
the
level
of
european
intellect
and
even
now
that
i
have
seen
this
favourite
fabric
of
her
imagination
fall
to
pieces
beneath
her
feet
i
can
not
recall
the
with
which
she
gave
herself
to
it
without
admiration
the
only
white
persons
we
found
at
nashoba
were
my
amiable
friend
w
the
sister
of
miss
wright
and
her
husband
i
think
they
had
between
thirty
and
forty
slaves
including
children
but
when
i
was
there
no
school
had
been
established
books
and
other
materials
for
the
great
experiment
had
been
collected
and
one
or
two
professors
engaged
but
nothing
was
yet
organized
i
found
my
friend
w
in
very
bad
health
which
she
confessed
she
attributed
to
the
climate
this
naturally
so
much
alarmed
me
for
my
children
that
i
decided
upon
leaving
the
place
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
and
did
so
at
the
end
of
ten
days
i
do
not
exactly
know
what
was
the
immediate
cause
which
induced
miss
wright
to
abandon
a
scheme
which
had
taken
such
possession
of
her
imagination
and
on
which
she
had
expended
so
much
money
but
many
months
had
not
elapsed
before
i
learnt
with
much
pleasure
that
she
and
her
sister
had
also
left
it
i
think
it
probable
that
she
became
aware
upon
returning
to
nashoba
that
the
climate
was
too
hostile
to
their
health
all
i
know
farther
of
nashoba
is
that
miss
wright
having
found
from
some
cause
or
other
that
it
was
impossible
to
pursue
her
object
herself
accompanied
her
slaves
to
hayti
and
left
them
there
free
and
under
the
protection
of
the
president
i
found
no
beauty
in
the
scenery
round
nashoba
nor
can
i
conceive
that
it
would
possess
any
even
in
summer
the
trees
were
so
close
to
each
other
as
not
to
permit
the
growth
of
underwood
the
great
ornament
of
the
forest
at
new
orleans
and
still
less
of
our
seeing
any
openings
where
the
varying
effects
of
light
and
shade
might
atone
for
the
absence
of
other
objects
the
clearing
round
the
settlement
appeared
to
me
inconsiderable
and
imperfect
but
i
was
told
that
they
had
grown
good
crops
of
cotton
and
indian
corn
the
weather
was
dry
and
agreeable
and
the
aspects
of
the
heavens
by
night
surprisingly
beautiful
i
never
saw
moonlight
so
clear
so
pure
so
powerful
we
returned
to
memphis
on
the
january
and
found
ourselves
obliged
to
pass
five
days
there
awaiting
a
for
cincinnati
to
which
metropolis
of
the
west
i
was
now
determined
to
proceed
with
my
family
to
await
the
arrival
of
trollope
we
were
told
by
everyone
we
spoke
to
at
memphis
that
it
was
in
all
respects
the
finest
situation
west
of
the
alleghanies
we
found
many
lovely
walks
among
the
broken
forest
glades
around
memphis
which
together
with
a
morning
and
evening
enjoyment
of
the
effects
of
a
glowing
horizon
on
the
river
enabled
us
to
wait
patiently
for
the
boat
that
was
to
bear
us
away
chapter
departure
from
memphis
ohio
river
louisville
cincinnati
on
the
of
february
we
embarked
on
board
the
criterion
and
once
more
began
to
float
on
the
father
of
waters
as
the
poor
banished
indians
were
wont
to
call
the
mississippi
the
company
on
board
was
wonderfully
like
what
we
had
met
in
coming
from
new
orleans
i
think
they
must
have
all
been
first
cousins
and
what
was
singular
they
too
had
all
arrived
at
high
rank
in
the
army
for
many
a
wearisome
mile
above
the
wolf
river
the
only
scenery
was
still
forest
forest
forest
the
only
variety
was
produced
by
the
receding
of
the
river
at
some
points
and
its
encroaching
on
the
opposite
shore
these
changes
are
continually
going
on
but
from
what
cause
none
could
satisfactorily
explain
to
me
where
the
river
is
encroaching
the
trees
are
seen
growing
in
the
water
many
feet
deep
after
some
time
the
water
undermines
their
roots
and
they
become
the
easy
victims
of
the
first
hurricane
that
blows
this
is
one
source
of
the
immense
quantities
of
drift
wood
that
float
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
the
river
has
receded
a
young
growth
of
is
soon
seen
starting
up
with
the
rapid
vegetation
of
the
climate
these
two
circumstances
in
some
degree
relieve
the
sameness
of
the
thousand
miles
of
vegetable
wall
but
we
were
now
approaching
the
river
which
is
emphatically
called
the
beautiful
la
belle
riveriere
of
the
new
orleans
french
and
a
few
days
took
us
i
trust
for
ever
out
of
that
murky
stream
which
is
as
emphatically
called
the
deadly
and
well
does
it
seem
to
merit
the
title
the
air
of
its
shores
is
mephitic
and
it
is
said
that
nothing
that
ever
sunk
beneath
its
muddy
surface
was
known
to
rise
again
as
truly
does
la
belle
riviere
deserve
its
name
the
ohio
is
bright
and
clear
its
banks
are
continually
varied
as
it
flows
through
what
is
called
a
rolling
country
which
seems
to
mean
a
district
that
can
not
a
dozen
paces
of
level
ground
at
a
time
the
primaeval
forest
still
occupies
a
considerable
portion
of
the
ground
and
hangs
in
solemn
grandeur
from
the
cliffs
but
it
is
broken
by
frequent
settlements
where
we
were
cheered
by
the
sight
of
herds
and
flocks
i
imagine
that
this
river
presents
almost
every
variety
of
river
scenery
sometimes
its
clear
wave
waters
a
meadow
of
level
turf
sometimes
it
is
bounded
by
perpendicular
rocks
pretty
dwellings
with
their
gay
porticos
are
seen
alternately
with
wild
intervals
of
forest
where
the
tangled
plainly
enough
indicates
what
inhabitants
are
native
there
often
a
mountain
torrent
comes
pouring
its
silver
tribute
to
the
stream
and
were
there
occasionally
a
ruined
abbey
or
feudal
castle
to
mix
the
romance
of
real
life
with
that
of
nature
the
ohio
would
be
perfect
so
powerful
was
the
effect
of
this
sweet
scenery
that
we
ceased
to
grumble
at
our
dinners
and
suppers
nay
we
almost
learnt
to
rival
our
neighbours
at
table
in
their
voracious
rapidity
of
swallowing
so
eager
were
we
to
place
ourselves
again
on
the
guard
lest
we
might
lose
sight
of
the
beauty
that
was
passing
away
from
us
yet
these
fair
shores
are
still
unhealthy
more
than
once
we
landed
and
conversed
with
the
families
of
the
and
scarcely
was
there
one
in
which
we
did
not
hear
of
some
member
who
had
lately
died
of
the
fever
they
are
all
subject
to
ague
and
though
their
dwellings
are
infinitely
better
than
those
on
the
mississippi
the
inhabitants
still
look
like
a
race
that
are
selling
their
lives
for
gold
louisville
is
a
considerable
town
prettily
situated
on
the
kentucky
or
south
side
of
the
ohio
we
spent
some
hours
in
seeing
all
it
had
to
shew
and
had
i
not
been
told
that
a
bad
fever
often
rages
there
during
the
warm
season
i
should
have
liked
to
pass
some
months
there
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
beautiful
country
in
its
vicinity
frankfort
and
lexington
are
both
towns
worth
visiting
though
from
their
being
out
of
the
way
places
i
never
got
to
either
the
first
is
the
seat
of
the
state
government
of
kentucky
and
the
last
is
i
was
told
the
residence
of
several
independent
families
who
with
more
leisure
than
is
usually
enjoyed
in
america
have
its
natural
accompaniment
more
refinement
the
falls
of
the
ohio
are
about
a
mile
below
louisville
and
produce
a
rapid
too
sudden
for
the
boats
to
pass
except
in
the
rainy
season
the
passengers
are
obliged
to
get
out
below
them
and
travel
by
land
to
louisville
where
they
find
other
vessels
ready
to
receive
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
we
were
spared
this
inconvenience
by
the
water
being
too
high
for
the
rapid
to
be
much
felt
and
it
will
soon
be
altogether
removed
by
the
louisville
canal
coming
into
operation
which
will
permit
the
to
continue
their
progress
from
below
the
falls
to
the
town
the
scenery
on
the
kentucky
side
is
much
finer
than
on
that
of
indiana
or
ohio
the
state
of
kentucky
was
the
darling
spot
of
many
tribes
of
indians
and
was
reserved
among
them
as
a
common
hunting
ground
it
is
said
that
they
can
not
yet
name
it
without
emotion
and
that
they
have
a
sad
and
wild
lament
that
they
still
chaunt
to
its
memory
but
their
exclusion
thence
is
of
no
recent
date
kentucky
has
been
longer
settled
than
the
illinois
indiana
or
ohio
and
it
appears
not
only
more
highly
cultivated
but
more
fertile
and
more
picturesque
than
either
i
have
rarely
seen
richer
pastures
than
those
of
kentucky
the
forest
trees
where
not
too
crowded
are
of
magnificent
growth
and
the
crops
are
gloriously
abundant
where
the
thriftless
husbandry
has
not
worn
out
the
soil
by
an
unvarying
succession
of
exhausting
crops
we
were
shewn
ground
which
had
borne
abundant
crops
of
wheat
for
twenty
successive
years
but
a
much
shorter
period
suffices
to
exhaust
the
ground
if
it
were
made
to
produce
tobacco
without
the
intermission
of
some
other
crop
we
reached
cincinnati
on
the
of
february
it
is
finely
situated
on
the
south
side
of
a
hill
that
rises
gently
from
the
water
edge
yet
it
is
by
no
means
a
city
of
striking
appearance
it
wants
domes
towers
and
steeples
but
its
is
noble
extending
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
is
well
paved
and
surrounded
by
neat
though
not
handsome
buildings
i
have
seen
fifteen
lying
there
at
once
and
still
half
the
wharf
was
unoccupied
on
arriving
we
repaired
to
the
washington
hotel
and
thought
ourselves
fortunate
when
we
were
told
that
we
were
just
in
time
for
dinner
at
the
table
but
when
the
door
was
opened
we
retreated
with
a
feeling
of
dismay
at
seeing
between
sixty
and
seventy
men
already
at
table
we
took
our
dinner
with
the
females
of
the
family
and
then
went
forth
to
seek
a
house
for
our
permanent
accommodation
we
went
to
the
office
of
an
advertising
agent
who
professed
to
keep
a
register
of
all
such
information
and
described
the
dwelling
we
wanted
he
made
no
difficulty
but
told
us
his
boy
should
be
our
guide
through
the
city
and
shew
us
what
we
sought
we
accordingly
set
out
with
him
and
he
led
us
up
one
street
and
down
another
but
evidently
without
any
determinate
object
i
therefore
stopped
and
asked
him
whereabout
the
houses
were
which
we
were
going
to
see
i
am
looking
for
bills
was
his
reply
i
thought
we
could
have
looked
for
bills
as
well
without
him
and
i
told
him
so
upon
which
he
assumed
an
air
of
great
activity
and
began
knocking
regularly
at
every
door
we
passed
enquiring
if
the
house
was
to
be
let
it
was
impossible
to
endure
this
long
and
our
guide
was
dismissed
though
i
was
afterwards
obliged
to
pay
him
a
dollar
for
his
services
we
had
the
good
fortune
however
to
find
a
dwelling
before
long
and
we
returned
to
our
hotel
having
determined
upon
taking
possession
of
it
as
soon
at
it
could
be
got
ready
not
wishing
to
take
our
evening
meal
either
with
the
three
score
and
ten
gentlemen
of
the
nor
yet
with
the
half
dozen
ladies
of
the
i
ordered
tea
in
my
own
chamber
a
irish
woman
came
forward
with
a
sort
of
patronising
manner
took
my
hand
and
said
och
my
honey
ye
be
from
the
old
country
i
see
you
will
have
your
tay
all
to
yourselves
honey
with
this
assurance
we
retired
to
my
room
which
was
a
handsome
one
as
to
its
size
and
bed
furniture
but
it
had
no
carpet
and
was
darkened
by
blinds
of
paper
such
as
rooms
are
hung
with
which
required
to
be
rolled
up
and
then
fastened
with
strings
very
awkwardly
attached
to
the
whenever
light
or
air
were
wished
for
i
afterwards
met
with
these
same
uncomfortable
blinds
in
every
part
of
america
our
irish
friend
soon
reappeared
and
brought
us
tea
together
with
the
never
failing
accompaniments
of
american
tea
drinking
hung
beef
chipped
up
raw
and
sundry
sweetmeats
of
brown
sugar
hue
and
flavour
we
took
our
tea
and
were
enjoying
our
family
talk
relative
to
our
future
arrangements
when
a
loud
sharp
knocking
was
heard
at
our
door
my
come
in
was
answered
by
the
appearance
of
a
portly
personage
who
proclaimed
himself
our
landlord
are
any
of
you
ill
he
began
no
thank
you
sir
we
are
all
quite
well
was
my
reply
then
madam
i
must
tell
you
that
i
can
not
accommodate
you
on
these
terms
we
have
no
family
here
and
you
must
live
either
with
me
or
my
wife
or
not
at
all
in
my
house
this
was
said
with
an
air
of
authority
that
almost
precluded
reply
but
i
ventured
a
sort
of
apologistic
hint
that
we
were
strangers
and
unaccustomed
to
the
manners
of
the
country
our
manners
are
very
good
manners
and
we
do
wish
any
changes
from
england
i
thought
of
mine
host
of
the
washington
afterwards
when
reading
scott
anne
of
geierstein
he
in
truth
strongly
resembled
the
inn
keeper
therein
immortalized
who
made
his
guests
eat
drink
and
sleep
just
where
when
and
how
he
pleased
i
made
no
farther
remonstrance
but
determined
to
hasten
my
removal
this
we
achieved
the
next
day
to
our
great
satisfaction
we
were
soon
settled
in
our
new
dwelling
which
looked
neat
and
comfortable
enough
but
we
speedily
found
that
it
was
devoid
of
nearly
all
the
accommodation
that
europeans
conceive
necessary
to
decency
and
comfort
no
pump
no
cistern
no
drain
of
any
kind
no
dustman
cart
or
any
other
visible
means
of
getting
rid
of
the
rubbish
which
vanishes
with
such
celerity
in
london
that
one
has
no
time
to
think
of
its
existence
but
which
accumulated
so
rapidly
at
cincinnati
that
i
sent
for
my
landlord
to
know
in
what
manner
refuse
of
all
kinds
was
to
be
disposed
of
your
help
will
just
have
to
fix
them
all
into
the
middle
of
the
street
but
you
must
mind
old
woman
that
it
is
the
middle
i
expect
you
do
know
as
we
have
got
a
law
what
forbids
throwing
such
things
at
the
sides
of
the
streets
they
must
just
all
be
cast
right
into
the
middle
and
the
pigs
soon
takes
them
off
in
truth
the
pigs
are
constantly
seen
doing
herculean
service
in
this
way
through
every
quarter
of
the
city
and
though
it
is
not
very
agreeable
to
live
surrounded
by
herds
of
these
unsavoury
animals
it
is
well
they
are
so
numerous
and
so
active
in
their
capacity
of
scavengers
for
without
them
the
streets
would
soon
be
choked
up
with
all
sorts
of
substances
in
every
stage
of
decomposition
we
had
heard
so
much
of
cincinnati
its
beauty
wealth
and
unequalled
prosperity
that
when
we
left
memphis
to
go
thither
we
almost
felt
the
delight
of
rousseau
novice
un
voyage
à
faire
et
paris
au
bout
as
soon
therefore
as
our
little
domestic
arrangements
were
completed
we
set
forth
to
view
this
wonder
of
the
west
this
prophet
gourd
of
magic
growth
this
infant
hercules
and
surely
no
travellers
ever
paraded
a
city
under
circumstances
more
favourable
to
their
finding
it
fair
to
the
sight
three
dreary
months
had
elapsed
since
we
had
left
the
glories
of
london
behind
us
for
nearly
the
whole
of
that
time
we
beheld
no
other
architecture
than
what
our
ship
and
had
furnished
and
excepting
at
new
orleans
had
seen
hardly
a
trace
of
human
habitations
the
sight
of
bricks
and
mortar
was
really
refreshing
and
a
house
of
three
stories
looked
splendid
of
this
splendour
we
saw
repeated
specimens
and
moreover
a
brick
church
which
from
its
two
little
peaked
spires
is
called
the
church
but
alas
the
flatness
of
reality
after
the
imagination
has
been
busy
i
hardly
know
what
i
expected
to
find
in
this
city
fresh
risen
from
the
bosom
of
the
wilderness
but
certainly
it
was
not
a
little
town
about
the
size
of
salisbury
without
even
an
attempt
at
beauty
in
any
of
its
edifices
and
with
only
just
enough
of
the
air
of
a
city
to
make
it
noisy
and
bustling
the
population
is
greater
than
the
appearance
of
the
town
would
lead
one
to
expect
this
is
partly
owing
to
the
number
of
free
negroes
who
herd
together
in
an
obscure
part
of
the
city
called
little
africa
and
partly
to
the
density
of
the
population
round
the
and
other
manufactories
i
believe
the
number
of
inhabitants
exceeds
twenty
thousand
we
arrived
in
cincinnati
in
february
and
i
speak
of
the
town
as
it
was
then
several
small
churches
have
been
built
since
whose
towers
agreeably
relieve
its
uninteresting
mass
of
buildings
at
that
time
i
think
main
street
which
is
the
principal
avenue
and
runs
through
the
whole
town
answering
to
the
high
street
of
our
old
cities
was
the
only
one
entirely
paved
the
is
of
brick
tolerably
well
laid
but
it
is
inundated
by
every
shower
as
cincinnati
has
no
drains
whatever
what
makes
this
omission
the
more
remarkable
is
that
the
situation
of
the
place
is
calculated
both
to
facilitate
their
construction
and
render
them
necessary
cincinnati
is
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
that
begins
to
rise
at
the
river
edge
and
were
it
furnished
with
drains
of
the
simplest
arrangement
the
heavy
showers
of
the
climate
would
keep
them
constantly
clean
as
it
is
these
showers
wash
the
higher
streets
only
to
deposit
their
filth
in
the
first
level
spot
and
this
happens
to
be
in
the
street
second
in
importance
to
main
street
running
at
right
angles
to
it
and
containing
most
of
the
large
warehouses
of
the
town
this
deposit
is
a
dreadful
nuisance
and
must
be
productive
of
miasma
during
the
hot
weather
the
town
is
built
as
i
believe
most
american
towns
are
in
squares
as
they
call
them
but
these
squares
are
the
reverse
of
our
being
solid
instead
of
hollow
each
consists
or
is
intended
to
consist
when
the
plan
of
the
city
is
completed
of
a
block
of
buildings
fronting
north
east
west
and
south
each
house
communicating
with
an
alley
furnishing
a
back
entrance
this
plan
would
not
be
a
bad
one
were
the
town
properly
drained
but
as
it
is
these
alleys
are
horrible
abominations
and
must
i
conceive
become
worse
with
every
passing
year
to
the
north
cincinnati
is
bounded
by
a
range
of
hills
sufficiently
steep
and
rugged
to
prevent
their
being
built
upon
or
easily
cultivated
but
not
sufficiently
high
to
command
from
their
summits
a
view
of
any
considerable
extent
deep
and
narrow
dry
in
summer
but
bringing
down
heavy
streams
in
winter
divide
these
hills
into
many
separate
heights
and
this
furnishes
the
only
variety
the
landscape
offers
for
many
miles
round
the
town
the
lovely
ohio
is
a
beautiful
feature
wherever
it
is
visible
but
the
only
part
of
the
city
that
has
the
advantage
of
its
beauty
is
the
street
nearest
to
its
bank
the
hills
of
kentucky
which
rise
at
about
the
same
distance
from
the
river
on
the
opposite
side
form
the
southern
boundary
to
the
basin
in
which
cincinnati
is
built
on
first
arriving
i
thought
the
many
tree
covered
hills
around
very
beautiful
but
long
before
my
departure
i
felt
so
weary
of
the
confined
view
that
salisbury
plain
would
have
been
an
agreeable
variety
i
doubt
if
any
inhabitant
of
cincinnati
ever
mounted
these
hills
so
often
as
myself
and
my
children
but
it
was
rather
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
freer
air
than
for
any
beauty
of
prospect
that
we
took
our
daily
climb
these
hills
afford
neither
shrubs
nor
flowers
but
furnish
the
finest
specimens
of
millepore
in
the
world
and
the
water
courses
are
full
of
fossil
productions
the
forest
trees
are
neither
large
nor
well
grown
and
so
close
as
to
be
nearly
knotted
together
at
top
even
the
wild
vine
here
loses
its
beauty
for
its
graceful
festoons
bear
leaves
only
when
they
reach
the
higher
branches
of
the
tree
that
supports
them
both
air
and
light
being
too
scantily
found
below
to
admit
of
their
doing
more
than
climbing
with
a
bare
stem
till
they
reach
a
better
atmosphere
the
herb
we
call
pennyroyal
was
the
only
one
i
found
in
abundance
and
that
only
on
the
brows
where
the
ground
had
been
partially
cleared
vegetation
is
impossible
elsewhere
and
it
is
this
circumstance
which
makes
the
eternal
forests
of
america
so
detestable
near
new
orleans
the
undergrowth
of
palmetto
and
pawpaw
is
highly
beautiful
but
in
tennessee
indiana
and
ohio
i
never
found
the
slightest
beauty
in
the
forest
scenery
fallen
trees
in
every
possible
stage
of
decay
and
congeries
of
leaves
that
have
been
rotting
since
the
flood
cover
the
ground
and
infect
the
air
the
beautiful
variety
of
foliage
afforded
by
evergreens
never
occurs
and
in
tennessee
and
that
part
of
ohio
that
surrounds
cincinnati
even
the
sterile
beauty
of
rocks
is
wanting
on
crossing

to
kentucky
the
scene
is
greatly
improved
beech
and

border
the
beautiful
river
the
ground
has
been
well
cleared
and
the
herbage
is
excellent
the
pawpaw
grows
abundantly
and
is
a
splendid
shrub
though
it
bears
neither
fruit
nor
flowers
so
far
north
the
noble
tulip
tree
flourishes
here
and
blooms
profusely
the
river
licking
flows
into
the

nearly
opposite
cincinnati
it
is
a
pretty
winding
stream
and
two
or
three
miles
from
its
mouth
has
a
brisk
rapid
dancing
among
white
stones

in
the
absence

chapter

though
i
do
not
quite
sympathise
with
those
who
consider
cincinnati
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
earth
i
certainly
think
it
a
city
of
extraordinary
size
and
importance
when
it
is
remembered
that
thirty
years
ago
the
aboriginal
forest
occupied
the
ground
where
it
stands
and
every
month
appears
to
extend
its
limits
and
its
wealth
some
of
the
native
political
economists
assert
that
this
rapid
conversion
of
a
into
a
prosperous
city
is
the
result
of
free
political
institutions
not
being
very
deep
in
such
matters
a
more
obvious
cause
suggested
itself
to
me
in
the
unceasing
goad
which
necessity
applies
to
industry
in
this
country
and
in
the
absence
of
all
resource
for
the
idle
during
nearly
two
years
that
i
resided
in
cincinnati
or
its
neighbourhood
i
neither
saw
a
beggar
nor
a
man
of
sufficient
fortune
to
permit
his
ceasing
his
efforts
to
increase
it
thus
every
bee
in
the
hive
is
actively
employed
in
search
of
that
honey
of
hybla
vulgarly
called
money
neither
art
science
learning
nor
pleasure
can
seduce
them
from
its
pursuit
this
unity
of
purpose
backed
by
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
joined
with
an
acuteness
and
total
absence
of
probity
where
interest
is
concerned
which
might
set
canny
yorkshire
at
defiance
may
well
go
far
towards
obtaining
its
purpose
the
low
rate
of
taxation
too
unquestionably
permits
a
more
rapid
accumulation
of
individual
wealth
than
with
us
but
till
i
had
travelled
through
america
i
had
no
idea
how
much
of
the
money
collected
in
taxes
returns
among
the
people
not
only
in
the
purchase
of
what
their
industry
furnishes
but
in
the
actual
enjoyment
of
what
is
furnished
were
i
an
english
legislator
instead
of
sending
sedition
to
the
tower
i
would
send
her
to
make
a
tour
of
the
united
states
i
had
a
little
leaning
towards
sedition
myself
when
i
set
out
but
before
i
had
half
completed
my
tour
i
was
quite
cured
i
have
read
much
of
the
few
and
simple
wants
of
rational
man
and
i
used
to
give
a
sort
of
dreamy
acquiescence
to
the
reasoning
that
went
to
prove
each
added
want
an
added
woe
those
who
reason
in
a
comfortable
london
know
little
about
the
matter
were
the
aliments
which
sustain
life
all
that
we
wanted
the
faculties
of
the
hog
might
suffice
us
but
if
we
analyze
an
hour
of
enjoyment
we
shall
find
that
it
is
made
up
of
agreeable
sensations
occasioned
by
a
thousand
delicate
impressions
on
almost
as
many
nerves
where
these
nerves
are
sluggish
from
never
having
been
awakened
external
objects
are
less
important
for
they
are
less
perceived
but
where
the
whole
machine
of
the
human
frame
is
in
full
activity
where
every
sense
brings
home
to
consciousness
its
touch
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
then
every
object
that
meets
the
senses
is
important
as
a
vehicle
of
happiness
or
misery
but
let
no
frames
so
tempered
visit
the
united
states
or
if
they
do
let
it
be
with
no
longer
pausing
than
will
store
the
memory
with
images
which
by
the
force
of
contrast
shall
sweeten
the
future

the
simple
manner
of
living
in
western
america
was
more
distasteful
to
me
from
its
levelling
effects
on
the
manners
of
the
people
than
from
the
personal
privations
that
it
rendered
necessary
and
yet
till
i
was
without
them
i
was
in
no
degree
aware
of
the
many
pleasurable
sensations
derived
from
the
little
elegancies
and
refinements
enjoyed
by
the
middle
classes
in
europe
there
were
many
circumstances
too
trifling
even
for
my
gossiping
pages
which
pressed
themselves
daily
and
hourly
upon
us
and
which
forced
us
to
remember
painfully
that
we
were
not
at
home
it
requires
an
abler
pen
than
mine
to
trace
the
connection
which
i
am
persuaded
exists
between
these
deficiencies
and
the
minds
and
manners
of
the
people
all
animal
wants
are
supplied
profusely
at
cincinnati
and
at
a
very
easy
rate
but
alas
these
go
but
a
little
way
in
the
history
of
a
day
enjoyment
the
total
and
universal
want
of
manners
both
in
males
and
females
is
so
remarkable
that
i
was
constantly
endeavouring
to
account
for
it
it
certainly
does
not
proceed
from
want
of
intellect
i
have
listened
to
much
dull
and
heavy
conversation
in
america
but
rarely
to
any
that
i
could
strictly
call
silly
if
i
except
the
every
where
privileged
class
of
very
young
ladies
they
appear
to
me
to
have
clear
heads
and
active
intellects
are
more
ignorant
on
subjects
that
are
only
of
conventional
value
than
on
such
as
are
of
intrinsic
importance
but
there
is
no
charm
no
grace
in
their
conversation
i
very
seldom
during
my
whole
stay
in
the
country
heard
a
sentence
elegantly
turned
and
correctly
pronounced
from
the
lips
of
an
american
there
is
always
something
either
in
the
expression
or
the
accent
that
jars
the
feelings
and
shocks
the
taste
i
will
not
pretend
to
decide
whether
man
is
better
or
worse
off
for
requiring
refinement
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
society
that
surrounds
him
and
for
being
incapable
of
enjoyment
without
them
but
in
america
that
polish
which
removes
the
coarser
and
rougher
parts
of
our
nature
is
unknown
and
undreamed
of
there
is
much
substantial
comfort
and
some
display
in
the
larger
cities
in
many
of
the
more
obvious
features
they
are
as
paris
or
as
london
being
all
large
assemblies
of
active
and
intelligent
human
beings
but
yet
they
are
wonderfully
unlike
in
nearly
all
their
moral
features
now
god
forbid
that
any
reasonable
american
of
whom
there
are
so
many
millions
should
ever
come
to
ask
me
what
i
mean
i
should
find
it
very
difficult
nay
perhaps
utterly
impossible
to
explain
myself
but
on
the
other
hand
no
european
who
has
visited
the
union
will
find
the
least
difficulty
in
understanding
me
i
am
in
no
way
competent
to
judge
of
the
political
institutions
of
america
and
if
i
should
occasionally
make
an
observation
on
their
effects
as
they
meet
my
superficial
glance
they
will
be
made
in
the
spirit
and
with
the
feeling
of
a
woman
who
is
apt
to
tell
what
her
first
impressions
may
be
but
unapt
to
reason
back
from
effects
to
their
causes
such
observations
if
they
be
unworthy
of
much
attention
are
also
obnoxious
to
little
reproof
but
there
are
points
of
national
peculiarity
of
which
women
may
judge
as
ably
as
men
all
that
constitutes
the
external
of
society
may
be
fairly
trusted
to
us
captain
hall
when
asked
what
appeared
to
him
to
constitute
the
greatest
difference
between
england
and
america
replied
like
a
gallant
sailor
the
want
of
loyalty
were
the
same
question
put
to
me
i
should
answer
the
want
of
refinement
were
americans
indeed
disposed
to
assume
the
plain
unpretending
deportment
of
the
switzer
in
the
days
of
his
picturesque
simplicity
when
however
he
never
chewed
tobacco
it
would
be
in
bad
taste
to
censure
him
but
this
is
not
the
case
jonathan
will
be
a
fine
gentleman
but
it
must
be
in
his
own
way
is
he
not
a
american
jonathan
however
must
remember
that
if
he
will
challenge
competition
with
the
old
world
the
old
world
will
now
and
then
look
out
to
see
how
he
supports
his
pretensions
with
their
hours
of
business
whether
judicial
or
mercantile
civil
or
military
i
have
nothing
to
do
i
doubt
not
they
are
all
spent
wisely
and
profitably
but
what
are
their
hours
of
recreation
those
hours
that
with
us
are
passed
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
that
art
can
win
from
nature
when
if
the
elaborate
repast
be
more
deeply
relished
than
sages
might
approve
it
is
redeemed
from
sensuality
by
the
presence
of
elegance
and
beauty
what
is
the
american
pendant
to
this
i
will
not
draw
any
comparisons
between
a
good
dinner
party
in
the
two
countries
i
have
heard
american
gentlemen
say
that
they
could
perceive
no
difference
between
them
but
in
speaking
of
general
manners
i
may
observe
that
it
is
rarely
they
dine
in
society
except
in
taverns
and
boarding
houses
then
they
eat
with
the
greatest
possible
rapidity
and
in
total
silence
i
have
heard
it
said
by
american
ladies
that
the
hours
of
greatest
enjoyment
to
the
gentlemen
were
those
in
which
a
glass
of
gin
cocktail
or
egging
receives
its
highest
relish
from
the
absence
of
all
restraint
whatever
and
when
there
were
no
ladies
to
trouble
them
notwithstanding
all
this
the
country
is
a
very
fine
country
well
worth
visiting
for
a
thousand
reasons
nine
hundred
and
of
these
are
reasons
founded
on
admiration
and
respect
the
thousandth
is
that
we
shall
feel
the
more
contented
with
our
own
the
more
unlike
a
country
through
which
we
travel
is
to
all
we
have
left
the
more
we
are
likely
to
be
amused
every
thing
in
cincinnati
had
this
newness
and
i
should
have
thought
it
a
place
delightful
to
visit
but
to
tarry
there
was
not
to
feel
at
home
my
home
however
for
a
time
it
was
to
be
we
heard
on
every
side
that
of
all
the
known
places
on
the
globe
called
earth
cincinnati
was
the
most
favourable
for
a
young
man
to
settle
in
and
i
only
awaited
the
arrival
of
to
fix
our
son
there
intending
to
continue
with
him
till
he
should
feel
himself
sufficiently
established
we
accordingly
determined
upon
making
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
i
took
a
larger
house
which
however
i
did
not
obtain
without
considerable
difficulty
as
notwithstanding
fourteen
hundred
new
dwellings
had
been
erected
the
preceding
year
the
demand
for
houses
greatly
exceeded
the
supply
we
became
acquainted
with
several
amiable
people
and
we
beguiled
the
anxious
interval
that
preceded
joining
us
by
frequent
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
which
not
only
afforded
us
amusement
but
gave
us
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
mode
of
life
of
the
country
people
we
visited
one
farm
which
interested
us
particularly
from
its
wild
and
lonely
situation
and
from
the
entire
dependence
of
the
inhabitants
upon
their
own
resources
it
was
a
partial
clearing
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
the
house
was
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
so
steep
that
a
high
ladder
was
necessary
to
enter
the
front
door
while
the
back
one
opened
against
the
hill
side
at
the
foot
of
this
sudden
eminence
ran
a
clear
stream
whose
bed
had
been
deepened
into
a
little
reservoir
just
opposite
the
house
a
noble
field
of
stretched
away
into
the
forest
on
one
side
and
a
few
acres
with
a
shed
or
two
upon
them
occupied
the
other
giving
accommodation
to
cows
horses
pigs
and
chickens
innumerable
immediately
before
the
house
was
a
small
potatoe
garden
with
a
few
peach
and
apple
trees
the
house
was
built
of
logs
and
consisted
of
two
rooms
besides
a
little
shanty
or
that
was
used
as
a
kitchen
both
rooms
were
comfortably
furnished
with
good
beds
drawers
the
farmer
wife
and
a
young
woman
who
looked
like
her
sister
were
spinning
and
three
little
children
were
playing
about
the
woman
told
me
that
they
spun
and
wove
all
the
cotton
and
woolen
garments
of
the
family
and
knit
all
the
stockings
her
husband
though
not
a
by
trade
made
all
the
shoes
she
manufactured
all
the
soap
and
candles
they
used
and
prepared
her
sugar
from
the
on
their
farm
all
she
wanted
with
money
she
said
was
to
buy
coffee
tea
and
whiskey
and
she
could
get
enough
any
day
by
sending
a
batch
of
butter
and
chicken
to
market
they
used
no
wheat
nor
sold
any
of
their
corn
which
though
it
appeared
a
very
large
quantity
was
not
more
than
they
required
to
make
their
bread
and
cakes
of
various
kinds
and
to
feed
all
their
live
stock
during
the
winter
she
did
not
look
in
health
and
said
they
had
all
had
ague
in
the
fall
but
she
seemed
contented
and
proud
of
her
independence
though
it
was
in
somewhat
a
mournful
accent
that
she
said
tis
strange
to
us
to
see
company
i
expect
the
sun
may
rise
and
set
a
hundred
times
before
i
shall
see
another
that
does
not
belong
to
the
family
i
have
been
minute
in
the
description
of
this
forest
farm
as
i
think
it
the
best
specimen
i
saw
of
the
independence
of
which
so
much
is
said
in
america
these
people
were
indeed
independent
robinson
crusoe
was
hardly
more
so
and
they
eat
and
drink
abundantly
but
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
something
awful
and
almost
unnatural
in
their
loneliness
no
village
bell
ever
summoned
them
to
prayer
where
they
might
meet
the
friendly
greeting
of
their
when
they
die
no
spot
sacred
by
ancient
reverence
will
receive
their
bones
religion
will
not
breathe
her
sweet
and
solemn
farewell
upon
their
grave
the
husband
or
the
father
will
dig
the
pit
that
is
to
hold
them
beneath
the
nearest
tree
he
will
himself
deposit
them
within
it
and
the
wind
that
whispers
through
the
boughs
will
be
their
only
requiem
but
then
they
pay
neither
taxes
nor
tythes
are
never
expected
to
pull
off
a
hat
or
to
make
a
curtsy
and
will
live
and
die
without
hearing
or
uttering
the
dreadful
words
god

the
king
about
two
miles
below
cincinnati
on
the
kentucky
side
of
the
river
bullock
the
well
known
proprietor
of
the
egyptian
hall
has
bought
a
large
estate
with
a
noble
house
upon
it
he
and
his
amiable
wife
were
devoting
themselves
to
the
embellishment
of
the
house
and
grounds
and
certainly
there
is
more
taste
and
art
lavished
on
one
of
their
beautiful
saloons
than
all
western
america
can
show
elsewhere
it
is
impossible
to
help
feeling
that
bullock
is
rather
out
of
his
element
in
this
remote
spot
and
the
gems
of
art
he
has
brought
with
him
shew
as
strangely
there
as
would
a
bower
of
roses
in
siberia
or
a
cincinnati
fashionable
at
almack
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
spot
commanding
one
of
the
finest
reaches
of
the
ohio
the
extensive
gardens
and
the
large
and
handsome
mansion
have
tempted
bullock
to
spend
a
large
sum
in
the
purchase
of
this
place
and
if
any
one
who
has
passed
his
life
in
london
could
endure
such
a
change
the
active
mind
and
sanguine
spirit
of
bullock
might
enable
him
to
do
it
but
his
frank
and
truly
english
hospitality
and
his
enlightened
and
enquiring
mind
seemed
sadly
wasted
there
i
have
since
heard
with
pleasure
that
bullock
has
parted
with
this
beautiful
but
secluded
mansion
chapter

the
greatest
difficulty
in
organising
a
family
establishment
in
ohio
is
getting
servants
or
as
it
is
there
called
getting
help
for
it
is
more
than
petty
treason
to
the
republic
to
call
a
free
citizen
a
the
whole
class
of
young
women
whose
bread
depends
upon
their
labour
are
taught
to
believe
that
the
most
abject
poverty
is
preferable
to
domestic
service
hundreds
of
girls
work
in
the
or
in
any
other
manufactory
for
less
than
half
the
wages
they
would
receive
in
service
but
they
think
their
equality
is
compromised
by
the
latter
and
nothing
but
the
wish
to
obtain
some
particular
article
of
finery
will
ever
induce
them
to
submit
to
it
a
kind
friend
however
exerted
herself
so
effectually
for
me
that
a
tall
stately
lass
soon
presented
herself
saying
i
be
come
to
help
you
the
intelligence
was
very
agreeable
and
i
welcomed
her
in
the
most
gracious
manner
possible
and
asked
what
i
should
give
her
by
the
year
oh
gimini
exclaimed
the
damsel
with
a
loud
laugh
you
be
a
downright
englisher
sure
enough
i
should
like
to
see
a
young
lady
engage
by
the
year
in
america
i
hope
i
shall
get
a
husband
before
many
months
or
i
expect
i
shall
be
an
outright
old
maid
for
i
be
most
seventeen
already
besides
mayhap
i
may
want
to
go
to
school
you
must
just
give
me
a
dollar
and
half
a
week
and
mother
slave
phillis
must
come
over
once
a
week
i
expect
from
side
the
water
to
help
me
clean
i
agreed
to
the
bargain
of
course
with
all
dutiful
submission
and
seeing
she
was
preparing
to
set
to
work
in
a
yellow
dress
parseme
with
red
roses
i
gently
hinted
that
i
thought
it
was
a
pity
to
spoil
so
fine
a
gown
and
that
she
had
better
change
it
is
just
my
best
and
my
worst
she
answered
for
i
got
no
other
and
in
truth
i
found
that
this
young
lady
had
left
the
paternal
mansion
with
no
more
clothes
of
any
kind
than
what
she
had
on
i
immediately
gave
her
money
to
purchase
what
was
necessary
for
cleanliness
and
decency
and
set
to
work
with
my
daughters
to
make
her
a
gown
she
grinned
applause
when
our
labour
was
completed
but
never
uttered
the
slightest
expression
of
gratitude
for
that
or
for
any
thing
else
we
could
do
for
her
she
was
constantly
asking
us
to
lend
her
different
articles
of
dress
and
when
we
declined
it
she
said
well
i
never
seed
such
grumpy
folks
as
you
be
there
is
several
young
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
what
goes
to
live
out
now
and
then
with
the
old
women
about
the
town
and
they
and
their
gurls
always
lends
them
what
they
asks
for
i
guess
you
inglish
thinks
we
should
poison
your
things
just
as
bad
as
if
we
was
negurs
and
here
i
beg
to
assure
the
reader
that
whenever
i
give
conversations
they
were
not
made
à
loisir
but
were
written
down
immediately
after
they
occurred
with
all
the
verbal
fidelity
my
memory
permitted
this
young
lady
left
me
at
the
end
of
two
months
because
i
refused
to
lend
her
money
enough
to
buy
a
silk
dress
to
go
to
a
ball
saying
then
is
not
worth
my
while
to
stay
any
longer
i
can
not
imagine
it
possible
that
such
a
state
of
things
can
be
desirable
or
beneficial
to
any
of
the
parties
concerned
i
might
occupy
a
hundred
pages
on
the
subject
and
yet
fail
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
sore
angry
ever
wakeful
pride
that
seemed
to
torment
these
poor
wretches
in
many
of
them
it
was
so
excessive
that
all
feeling
of
displeasure
or
even
of
ridicule
was
lost
in
pity
one
of
these
was
a
pretty
girl
whose
natural
disposition
must
have
been
gentle
and
kind
but
her
good
feelings
were
soured
and
her
gentleness
turned
to
morbid
sensitiveness
by
having
heard
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
that
she
was
as
good
as
any
other
lady
that
all
men
were
equal
and
women
too
and
that
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
a
american
to
be
treated
like
a
servant
when
she
found
she
was
to
dine
in
the
kitchen
she
turned
up
her
pretty
lip
and
said
i
guess
that
you
do
think
good
enough
to
eat
with
you
you
find
that
wo
do
here
i
found
afterwards
that
she
rarely
ate
any
dinner
at
all
and
generally
passed
the
time
in
tears
i
did
every
thing
in
my
power
to
conciliate
and
make
her
happy
but
i
am
sure
she
hated
me
i
gave
her
very
high
wages
and
she
staid
till
she
had
obtained
several
expensive
articles
of
dress
and
then
un
beau
matin
she
came
to
me
full
dressed
and
said
i
must
go
when
shall
you
return
charlotte
i
expect
you
see
no
more
of
me
and
so
we
parted
her
sister
was
also
living
with
me
but
her
wardrobe
was
not
yet
completed
and
she
remained
some
weeks
longer
till
it
was
i
fear
it
may
be
called
bad
taste
to
say
so
much
concerning
my
domestics
but
nevertheless
the
circumstances
are
so
characteristic
of
america
that
i
must
recount
another
history
relating
to
them
a
few
days
after
the
departure
of
my
ambitious
belle
my
cries
for
help
had
been
so
effectual
that
another
young
lady
presented
herself
with
the
usual
preface
i
come
to
help
you
i
had
been
cautioned
never
to
ask
for
a
reference
for
character
as
it
would
not
only
rob
me
of
that
help
but
entirely
prevent
my
ever
getting
another
so
five
minutes
after
she
entered
she
was
installed
bundle
and
all
as
a
member
of
the
family
she
was
by
no
means
handsome
but
there
was
an
air
of
simple
frankness
in
her
manner
that
won
us
all
for
my
own
part
i
thought
i
had
got
a
second
jeanie
deans
for
she
recounted
to
me
histories
of
her
early
youth
wherein
her
plain
good
sense
and
strong
mind
had
enabled
her
to
win
her
way
through
a
host
of
cruel
faithless
lovers
and
cheating
brothers
among
other
things
she
told
me
with
the
appearance
of
much
emotion
that
she
had
found
since
she
came
to
town
a
cure
for
all
her
sorrows
thanks
and
praise
for
it
i
have
got
religion
and
then
she
asked
if
i
would
spare
her
to
go
to
meeting
every
tuesday
and
thursday
evening
you
shall
not
have
to
want
me
trollope
for
our
minister
knows
that
we
have
all
our
duties
to
perform
to
man
as
well
as
to
god
and
he
makes
the
meeting
late
in
the
evening
that
they
may
not
cross
one
another
who
could
refuse
not
i
and
nancy
had
leave
to
go
to
meeting
two
evenings
in
the
week
besides
sundays
one
night
that
the
mosquitoes
had
found
their
way
under
my
net
and
prevented
my
sleeping
i
heard
some
one
enter
the
house
very
late
i
got
up
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
by
the
help
of
a
bright
moon
recognised
nancy
best
bonnet
i
called
to
her
you
are
very
late
said
i
what
is
the
reason
of
it
oh
trollope
she
replied
i
am
late
indeed
we
have
this
night
had
seventeen
souls
added
to
our
flock
may
they
live
to
bless
this
night
but
it
has
been
a
long
sitting
and
very
warm
i
just
take
a
drink
of
water
and
get
to
bed
you
find
me
later
in
the
morning
for
it
nor
did
i
she
was
an
excellent
servant
and
performed
more
than
was
expected
from
her
moreover
she
always
found
time
to
read
the
bible
several
times
in
the
day
and
i
seldom
saw
her
occupied
about
any
thing
without
observing
that
she
had
placed
it
near
her
at
last
she
fell
sick
with
the
cholera
and
her
life
was
despaired
of
i
nursed
her
with
great
care
and
sat
up
the
greatest
part
of
two
nights
with
her
she
was
often
delirious
and
all
her
wandering
thoughts
seemed
to
ramble
to
heaven
i
have
been
a
sinner
she
said
but
i
am
safe
in
the
lord
jesus
when
she
recovered
she
asked
me
to
let
her
go
into
the
country
for
a
few
days
to
change
the
air
and
begged
me
to
lend
her
three
dollars
while
she
was
absent
a
lady
called
on
me
and
enquired
with
some
agitation
if
my
servant
nancy
fletcher
were
at
home
i
replied
that
she
was
gone
into
the
country
thank
god
she
exclaimed
never
let
her
enter
your
doors
again
she
is
the
most
abandoned
woman
in
the
town
a
gentleman
who
knows
you
has
been
told
that
she
lives
with
you
and
that
she
boasts
of
having
the
power
of
entering
your
house
at
any
hour
of
night
she
told
me
many
other
circumstances
unnecessary
to
repeat
but
all
tending
to
prove
that
she
was
a
very
dangerous
inmate
i
expected
her
home
the
next
evening
and
i
believe
i
passed
the
interval
in
meditating
how
to
get
rid
of
her
without
an
at
length
she
arrived
and
all
my
study
having
failed
to
supply
me
with
any
other
reason
than
the
real
one
for
dismissing
her
i
stated
it
at
once
not
the
slightest
change
passed
over
her
countenance
but
she
looked
steadily
at
me
and
said
in
a
very
civil
tone
i
should
like
to
know
who
told
you
i
replied
that
it
could
be
of
no
advantage
to
her
to
know
and
that
i
wished
her
to
go
immediately
i
am
ready
to
go
she
said
in
the
same
quiet
tone
but
what
will
you
do
for
your
three
dollars
i
must
do
without
them
nancy
good
morning
to
you
i
must
just
put
up
my
things
she
said
and
left
the
room
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
when
we
were
all
assembled
at
dinner
she
entered
with
her
usual
civil
composed
air
well
i
am
come
to
wish
you
all
goodbye
and
with
a
friendly
smile
she
left
us
this
adventure
frightened
me
so
heartily
that
notwithstanding
i
had
the
dread
of
cooking
my
own
dinner
before
my
eyes
i
would
not
take
any
more
young
ladies
into
my
family
without
receiving
some
slight
sketch
of
their
former
history
at
length
i
met
with
a
very
worthy
french
woman
and
soon
after
with
a
tidy
english
girl
to
assist
her
and
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
keep
them
till
a
short
time
before
my
departure
so
happily
i
have
no
more
misfortunes
of
this
nature
to
relate
such
being
the
difficulties
respecting
domestic
arrangements
it
is
obvious
that
the
ladies
who
are
brought
up
amongst
them
can
not
have
leisure
for
any
great
development
of
the
mind
it
is
in
fact
out
of
the
question
and
remembering
this
it
is
more
surprising
that
some
among
them
should
be
very
pleasing
than
that
none
should
be
highly
instructed
had
i
passed
as
many
evenings
in
company
in
any
other
town
that
i
ever
visited
as
i
did
in
cincinnati
i
should
have
been
able
to
give
some
little
account
of
the
conversations
i
had
listened
to
but
upon
reading
over
my
notes
and
then
taxing
my
memory
to
the
utmost
to
supply
the
deficiency
i
can
scarcely
find
a
trace
of
any
thing
that
deserves
the
name
such
as
i
have
shall
be
given
in
their
place
but
whatever
may
be
the
talents
of
the
persons
who
meet
together
in
society
the
very
shape
form
and
arrangement
of
the
meeting
is
sufficient
to
paralyze
conversation
the
women
invariably
herd
together
at
one
part
of
the
room
and
the
men
at
the
other
but
in
justice
to
cincinnati
i
must
acknowledge
that
this
arrangement
is
by
no
means
peculiar
to
that
city
or
to
the
western
side
of
the
alleghanies
sometimes
a
small
attempt
at
music
produces
a
partial
reunion
a
few
of
the
most
daring
youths
animated
by
the
consciousness
of
curled
hair
and
smart
waistcoats
approach
the
piano
forte
and
begin
to
mutter
a
little
to
the
pretty
things
who
are
comparing
with
one
another
how
many
quarters
music
they
have
had
where
the
mansion
is
of
sufficient
dignity
to
have
two
the
piano
the
little
ladies
and
the
slender
gentlemen
are
left
to
themselves
and
on
such
occasions
the
sound
of
laughter
is
often
heard
to
issue
from
among
them
but
the
fate
of
the
more
dignified
personages
who
are
left
in
the
other
room
is
extremely
dismal
the
gentlemen
spit
talk
of
elections
and
the
price
of
produce
and
spit
again
the
ladies
look
at
each
other
dresses
till
they
know
every
pin
by
heart
talk
of
parson
somebody
last
sermon
on
the
day
of
judgment
on
new
pills
for
dyspepsia
till
the
tea
is
announced
when
they
all
console
themselves
together
for
whatever
they
may
have
suffered
in
keeping
awake
by
taking
more
tea
coffee
hot
cake
and
custard
hoe
cake
johny
cake
waffle
cake
and
dodger
cake
pickled
peaches
and
preserved
cucumbers
ham
turkey
hung
beef
apple
sauce
and
pickled
oysters
than
ever
were
prepared
in
any
other
country
of
the
known
world
after
this
massive
meal
is
over
they
return
to
the
and
it
always
appeared
to
me
that
they
remained
together
as
long
as
they
could
bear
it
and
then
they
rise
en
masse

and

perhaps
the
most
advantageous
feature
in
cincinnati
is
its
market
which
for
excellence
abundance
and
cheapness
can
hardly
i
should
think
be
surpassed
in
any
part
of
the
world
if
i
except
the
luxury
of
fruits
which
are
very
inferior
to
any
i
have
seen
in
europe
there
are
no
butchers
fishmongers
or
indeed
any
shops
for
eatables
except
bakeries
as
they
are
called
in
the
town
every
thing
must
be
purchased
at
market
and
to
accomplish
this
the
busy
housewife
must
be
stirring
betimes
or
of
the
abundant
supply
she
will
find
her
hopes
of
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
for
the
day
defeated
the
market
being
pretty
well
over
by
eight
the
beef
is
excellent
and
the
highest
price
when
we
were
there
four
cents
about
the
pound
the
mutton
was
inferior
and
so
was
veal
to
the
eye
but
it
ate
well
though
not
very
fat
the
price
was
about
the
same
the
poultry
was
excellent
fowls
or
chickens
ready
for
table
twelve
cents
but
much
less
if
bought
alive
and
not
quite
fat
turkeys
about
fifty
cents
and
geese
the
same
the
ohio
furnishes
several
sorts
of
fish
some
of
them
very
good
and
always
to
be
found
cheap
and
abundant
in
the
market
eggs
butter
nearly
all
kinds
of
vegetables
excellent
and
at
moderate
prices
from
june
till
december
tomatoes
the
great
luxury
of
the
american
table
in
the
opinion
of
most
europeans
may
be
found
in
the
highest
perfection
in
the
market
for
about
sixpence
the
peck
they
have
a
great
variety
of
beans
unknown
in
england
particularly
the
the
seed
of
which
is
dressed
like
the
french
harico
it
furnishes
a
very
abundant
crop
and
is
a
most
delicious
vegetable
could
it
be
naturalised
with
us
it
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
the
windsor
or
will
not
do
well
there
bullock
had
them
in
his
garden
where
they
were
cultivated
with
much
care
they
grew
about
a
foot
high
and
blossomed
but
the
pod
never
ripened
all
the
fruit
i
saw
exposed
for
sale
in
cincinnati
was
most
miserable
i
passed
two
summers
there
but
never
tasted
a
peach
worth
eating
of
apricots
and
nectarines
i
saw
none
strawberries
very
small
raspberries
much
worse
gooseberries
very
few
and
quite
uneatable
currants
about
half
the
size
of
ours
and
about
double
the
price
grapes
too
sour
for
tarts
apples
abundant
but
very
indifferent
none
that
would
be
thought
good
enough
for
an
english
table
pears
cherries
and
plums
most
miserably
bad
the
flowers
of
these
regions
were
at
least
equally
inferior
whether
this
proceeds
from
want
of
cultivation
or
from
peculiarity
of
soil
i
know
not
but
after
leaving
cincinnati
i
was
told
by
a
gentleman
who
appeared
to
understand
the
subject
that
the
state
of
ohio
had
no
indigenous
flowers
or
fruits
the
which
in
that
warm
climate
furnish
a
delightful
refreshment
were
abundant
and
cheap
but
all
other
melons
very
inferior
to
those
of
france
or
even
of
england
when
ripened
in
a
common
from
the
almost
total
want
of
pasturage
near
the
city
it
is
difficult
for
a
stranger
to
divine
how
milk
is
furnished
for
its
supply
but
we
soon
learnt
that
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
keeping
a
cow
a
large
proportion
of
the
families
in
the
town
particularly
of
the
poorer
class
have
one
though
apparently
without
any
accommodation
whatever
for
it
these
animals
are
fed
morning
and
evening
at
the
door
of
the
house
with
a
good
mess
of
indian
corn
boiled
with
water
while
they
eat
they
are
milked
and
when
the
operation
is
completed
the
and
the
retreat
into
the
dwelling
leaving
the
republican
cow
to
walk
away
to
take
her
pleasure
on
the
hills
or
in
the
gutters
as
may
suit
her
fancy
best
they
generally
return
very
regularly
to
give
and
take
the
morning
and
evening
meal
though
it
more
than
once
happened
to
us
before
we
were
supplied
by
a
regular
milk
cart
to
have
our
jug
sent
home
empty
with
the
sad
news
that
the
cow
was
not
come
home
and
it
was
too
late
to
look
for
her
to
breakfast
now
once
i
remember
the
good
woman
told
us
that
she
had
overslept
herself
and
that
the
cow
had
come
and
gone
again
not
liking
i
expect
to
hanker
about
by
herself
for
nothing
poor
thing
cincinnati
has
not
many
lions
to
boast
but
among
them
are
two
museums
of
natural
history
both
of
these
contain
many
respectable
specimens
particularly
that
of
dorfeuille
who
has
moreover
some
highly
interesting
indian
antiquities
he
is
a
man
of
taste
and
science
but
a
collection
formed
strictly
according
to
their
dictates
would
by
no
means
satisfy
the
western
metropolis
the
people
have
a
most
extravagant
passion
for
wax
figures
and
the
two
museums
vie
with
each
other
in
displaying
specimens
of
this
barbarous
branch
of
art
as
dorfeuille
can
not
trust
to
his
science
for
attracting
the
citizens
he
has
put
his
ingenuity
into
requisition
and
this
has
proved
to
him
the
surer
aid
of
the
two
he
has
constructed
a
pandaemonium
in
an
upper
story
of
his
museum
in
which
he
has
congregated
all
the
images
of
horror
that
his
fertile
fancy
could
devise
dwarfs
that
by
machinery
grow
into
giants
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectator
imps
of
ebony
with
eyes
of
flame
monstrous
reptiles
devouring
youth
and
beauty
lakes
of
fire
and
mountains
of
ice
in
short
wax
paint
and
springs
have
done
wonders
to
give
the
scheme
some
more
effect
he
makes
it
visible
only
through
a
grate
of
massive
iron
bars
among
which
are
arranged
wires
connected
with
an
electrical
machine
in
a
neighbouring
chamber
should
any
daring
hand
or
foot
obtrude
itself
with
the
bars
it
receives
a
smart
shock
that
often
passes
through
many
of
the
crowd
and
the
cause
being
unknown
the
effect
is
exceedingly
comic
terror
astonishment
curiosity
are
all
set
in
action
and
all
contribute
to
make
dorfeuille
hell
one
of
the
most
amusing
exhibitions
imaginable
there
is
also
a
picture
gallery
at
cincinnati
and
this
was
a
circumstance
of
much
interest
to
us
as
our
friend
who
had
accompanied
miss
wright
to
america
in
the
expectation
of
finding
a
good
opening
in
the
line
of
historical
painting
intended
commencing
his
experiment
at
cincinnati
it
would
be
invidious
to
describe
the
picture
gallery
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
years
hence
it
will
present
a
very
different
appearance
was
very
kindly
received
by
many
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
city
and
though
the
state
of
the
fine
arts
there
gave
him
but
little
hope
that
he
should
meet
with
much
success
he
immediately
occupied
himself
in
painting
a
noble
historical
picture
of
the
landing
of
general
lafayette
at
cincinnati
perhaps
the
clearest
proof
of
the
little
feeling
for
art
that
existed
at
that
time
in
cincinnati
may
be
drawn
from
the
result
of
an
experiment
originated
by
a
german
who
taught
drawing
there
he
conceived
the
project
of
forming
a
chartered
academy
of
fine
arts
and
he
succeeded
in
the
beginning
to
his
utmost
wish
or
rather
they
fooled
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent
three
thousand
dollars
were
subscribed
that
is
to
say
names
were
written
against
different
sums
to
that
amount
a
house
was
chosen
and
finally
application
was
made
to
the
government
and
the
charter
obtained
rehearsing
formally
the
names
of
the
subscribing
members
the
professors
and
the
officers
so
far
did
the
steam
of
their
zeal
impel
them
but
at
this
point
it
was
let
off
the
affair
stood
still
and
i
never
heard
the
academy
of
fine
arts
mentioned
afterwards
this
same
german
gentleman
on
seeing
sketches
was
so
well
pleased
with
them
that
he
immediately
proposed
his
joining
him
in
his
drawing
school
with
an
agreement
i
believe
that
his
payment
from
it
should
be
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
accepted
the
proposal
but
the
union
did
not
last
long
and
the
cause
of
its
dissolution
was
too
american
to
be
omitted
prepared
his
models
and
attended
the
class
which
was
numerous
consisting
both
of
boys
and
girls
he
soon
found
that
the
sage
called
decipline
was
not
one
of
the
assistants
and
he
remonstrated
against
the
constant
talking
and
running
from
one
part
of
the
room
to
another
but
in
vain
finding
however
that
he
could
do
nothing
till
this
was
discontinued
he
wrote
some
rules
enforcing
order
for
the
purpose
of
placing
them
at
the
door
of
the
academy
when
he
shewed
them
to
his
colleague
he
shook
his
head
and
said
very
goot
very
goot
in
europe
but
america
boys
and
gals
vill
not
bear
it
dey
will
do
just
vat
dey
please
suur
dey
vould
all
go
avay
next
day
and
you
will
not
enforce
these
regulations
monsieur
olar
not
for
de
vorld
monsieur
i
must
leave
the
young
republicans
to
your
management
i
heard
another
anecdote
that
will
help
to
show
the
state
of
art
at
this
time
in
the
west
bullock
was
shewing
to
some
gentlemen
of
the
first
standing
the
very
of
cincinnati
his
beautiful
collection
of
engravings
when
one
among
them
exclaimed
have
you
really
done
all
these
since
you
came
here
how
hard
you
must
have
worked
i
was
also
told
of
a
gentleman
of
high
cincinnati
ton
and
critical
of
his
taste
for
the
fine
arts
who
having
a
drawing
put
into
his
hands
representing
hebe
and
the
bird
umquhile
sacred
to
jupiter
demanded
in
a
satirical
tone
what
is
this
hebe
replied
the
alarmed
collector
hebe
sneered
the
man
of
taste
what
the
devil
has
hebe
to
do
with
the
american
eagle
we
had
not
been
long
at
cincinnati
when
caldwell
the
spurzheim
of
america
arrived
there
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
lectures
on
phrenology
i
attended
his
lectures
and
was
introduced
to
him
he
has
studied
spurzheim
and
combe
diligently
and
seems
to
understand
the
science
to
which
he
has
devoted
himself
but
neither
his
lectures
nor
his
conversation
had
that
delightful
truth
of
genuine
enthusiasm
which
makes
listening
to
spurzheim
so
great
a
treat
his
lectures
however
produced
considerable
effect
between
twenty
and
thirty
of
the
most
erudite
citizens
decided
upon
forming
a
phrenological
society
a
meeting
was
called
and
fully
attended
a
respectable
number
of
subscribers
names
was
registered
the
payment
of
subscriptions
being
arranged
for
a
future
day
president
president
treasurer
and
secretary
were
chosen
and
the
first
meeting
dissolved
with
every
appearance
of
energetic
perseverance
in
scientific
research
the
second
meeting
brought
together
of
this
learned
body
and
they
enacted
rules
and
laws
and
passed
resolutions
sufficient
it
was
said
to
have
filled
three
folios
a
third
day
of
meeting
arrived
which
was
an
important
one
as
on
this
occasion
the
subscriptions
were
to
be
paid
the
treasurer
came
punctually
but
found
himself
alone
with
patient
hope
he
waited
two
hours
for
the
wise
men
of
the
west
but
he
waited
in
vain
and
so
expired
the
phrenological
society
of
cincinnati
i
had
often
occasion
to
remark
that
the
spirit
of
enterprise
or
improvement
seldom
glowed
with
sufficient
ardour
to
resist
the
smothering
effect
of
a
demand
for
dollars
the
americans
love
talking
all
great
works
however
that
promise
a
profitable
result
are
sure
to
meet
support
from
men
who
have
enterprise
and
capital
sufficient
to
await
the
return
but
where
there
is
nothing
but
glory
or
the
gratification
of
taste
to
be
expected
it
is
i
believe
very
rarely
that
they
give
any
thing
beyond
their
most
sweet
voices
perhaps
they
are
right
in
europe
we
see
fortunes
crippled
by
a
passion
for
statues
or
for
pictures
or
for
books
or
for
gems
for
all
and
every
of
the
artificial
wants
that
give
grace
to
life
and
tend
to
make
man
forget
that
he
is
a
thing
of
clay
they
are
wiser
in
their
generation
on
the
other
side
the
atlantic
i
rarely
saw
any
thing
that
led
to
such
oblivion
there
soon
after
caldwell
departure
another
lecturer
appeared
upon
the
scene
whose
purpose
of
publicly
addressing
the
people
was
no
sooner
made
known
than
the
most
violent
sensation
was
excited
that
a
lady
of
fortune
family
and
education
whose
youth
had
been
passed
in
the
most
refined
circles
of
private
life
should
present
herself
to
the
people
as
a
public
lecturer
would
naturally
excite
surprise
any
where
and
the
nil
admirari
of
the
old
world
itself
would
hardly
be
sustained
before
such
a
spectacle
but
in
america
where
women
are
guarded
by
a
fold
shield
of
habitual
insignificance
it
caused
an
effect
that
can
hardly
be
described
miss
wright
of
nashoba
is
going
to
lecture
at
the
sounded
from
street
to
street
and
from
house
to
house
i
shared
the
surprise
but
not
the
wonder
i
knew
her
extraordinary
gift
of
eloquence
her
almost
unequalled
command
of
words
and
the
wonderful
power
of
her
rich
and
thrilling
voice
and
i
doubted
not
that
if
it
was
her
will
to
do
it
she
had
the
power
of
commanding
the
attention
and
enchanting
the
ear
of
any
audience
before
whom
it
was
her
pleasure
to
appear
i
was
most
anxious
to
hear
her
but
was
almost
deterred
from
attempting
it
by
the
reports
that
reached
me
of
the
immense
crowd
that
was
expected
after
many
consultations
and
hearing
that
many
other
ladies
intended
going
my
friend
p
and
myself
decided
upon
making
the
attempt
accompanied
by
a
party
of
gentlemen
and
found
the
difficulty
less
than
we
anticipated
though
the
building
was
crowded
in
every
part
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
we
had
had
the
courage
to
be
among
the
number
for
all
my
expectations
fell
far
short
of
the
splendour
the
brilliance
the
overwhelming
eloquence
of
this
extraordinary
orator
her
lecture
was
upon
the
nature
of
true
knowledge
and
it
contained
little
that
could
be
objected
to
by
any
sect
or
party
it
was
intended
as
an
introduction
to
the
strange
and
startling
theories
contained
in
her
subsequent
lectures
and
could
alarm
only
by
the
hints
it
contained
that
the
fabric
of
human
wisdom
could
rest
securely
on
no
other
base
than
that
of
human
knowledge
there
was
however
one
passage
from
which
revolted
it
was
one
wherein
she
quoted
that
phrase
of
mischievous
sophistry
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
this
false
and
futile
axiom
which
has
done
is
doing
and
will
do
so
much
harm
to
this
fine
country
came
from
jefferson
and
truly
his
life
was
a
glorious
commentary
upon
it
i
pretend
not
to
criticise
his
written
works
but
commonsense
enables
me
to
pronounce
this
his
favourite
maxim
false
few
names
are
held
in
higher
estimation
in
america
than
that
of
jefferson
it
is
the
touchstone
of
the
democratic
party
and
all
seem
to
agree
that
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
men
yet
i
have
heard
his
name
coupled
with
deeds
which
would
make
the
sons
of
europe
shudder
the
facts
i
allude
to
are
spoken
openly
by
all
not
whispered
privately
by
a
few
and
in
a
country
where
religion
is
the
talk
and
its
strict
observance
a
fashionable
distinction
these
facts
are
recorded
and
listened
to
without
horror
nay
without
emotion
jefferson
is
said
to
have
been
the
father
of
children
by
almost
all
his
numerous
gang
of
female
slaves
these
wretched
offspring
were
also
the
lawful
slaves
of
their
father
and
worked
in
his
house
and
plantations
as
such
in
particular
it
is
recorded
that
it
was
his
especial
pleasure
to
be
waited
upon
by
them
at
table
and
the
hospitable
orgies
for
which
his
montecielo
was
so
celebrated
were
incomplete
unless
the
goblet
he
quaffed
were
tendered
by
the
trembling
hand
of
his
own
slavish
offspring
i
once
heard
it
stated
by
a
democratical
adorer
of
this
great
man
that
when
as
it
sometimes
happened
his
children
by
quadroon
slaves
were
white
enough
to
escape
suspicion
of
their
origin
he
did
not
pursue
them
if
they
attempted
to
escape
saying
laughingly
let
the
rogues
get
off
if
they
can
i
will
not
hinder
them
this
was
stated
in
a
large
party
as
a
proof
of
his
kind
and
noble
nature
and
was
received
by
all
with
approving
smiles
if
i
know
anything
of
right
or
wrong
if
virtue
and
vice
be
indeed
something
more
than
words
then
was
this
great
american
an
unprincipled
tyrant
and
most
heartless
libertine
but
to
return
to
miss
wright
it
is
impossible
to
imaging
any
thing
more
striking
than
her
appearance
her
tall
and
majestic
figure
the
deep
and
almost
solemn
expression
of
her
eyes
the
simple
contour
of
her
finely
formed
head
unadorned
excepting
by
its
own
natural
ringlets
her
garment
of
plain
white
muslin
which
hung
around
her
in
folds
that
recalled
the
drapery
of
a
grecian
statue
all
contributed
to
produce
an
effect
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
seen
before
or
ever
expect
to
see
again
chapter
absence
of
public
and
private
amusement
churches
and
chapels
influence
of
the
clergy
a
revival
i
never
saw
any
people
who
appeared
to
live
so
much
without
amusement
as
the
cincinnatians
billiards
are
forbidden
by
law
so
are
cards
to
sell
a
pack
of
cards
in
ohio
subjects
the
seller
to
a
penalty
of
fifty
dollars
they
have
no
public
balls
excepting
i
think
six
during
the
christmas
holidays
they
have
no
concerts
they
have
no
dinner
parties
they
have
a
theatre
which
is
in
fact
the
only
public
amusement
of
this
triste
little
town
but
they
seem
to
care
little
about
it
and
either
from
economy
or
distaste
it
is
very
poorly
attended
ladies
are
rarely
seen
there
and
by
far
the
larger
proportion
of
females
deem
it
an
offence
against
religion
to
witness
the
representation
of
a
play
it
is
in
the
churches
and
chapels
of
the
town
that
the
ladies
are
to
be
seen
in
full
costume
and
i
am
tempted
to
believe
that
a
stranger
from
the
continent
of
europe
would
be
inclined
on
first
reconnoitering
the
city
to
suppose
that
the
places
of
worship
were
the
theatres
and
cafes
of
the
place
no
evening
in
the
week
but
brings
throngs
of
the
young
and
beautiful
to
the
chapels
and
houses
all
dressed
with
care
and
sometimes
with
great
pretension
it
is
there
that
all
display
is
made
and
all
fashionable
distinction
sought
the
proportion
of
gentlemen
attending
these
evening
meetings
is
very
small
but
often
as
might
be
expected
a
sprinkling
of
smart
young
clerks
make
this
sedulous
display
of
ribbons
and
ringlets
intelligible
and
natural
were
it
not
for
the
churches
indeed
i
think
there
might
be
a
general
bonfire
of
best
bonnets
for
i
never
could
discover
any
other
use
for
them
the
ladies
are
too
actively
employed
in
the
interior
of
their
houses
to
permit
much
parading
in
full
dress
for
morning
visits
there
are
no
public
gardens
or
lounging
shops
of
fashionable
resort
and
were
it
not
for
public
worship
and
private
drinkings
all
the
ladies
in
cincinnati
would
be
in
danger
of
becoming
perfect
recluses
the
influence
which
the
ministers
of
all
the
innumerable
religious
sects
throughout
america
have
on
the
females
of
their
respective
congregations
approaches
very
nearly
to
what
we
read
of
in
spain
or
in
other
strictly
roman
catholic
countries
there
are
many
causes
for
this
peculiar
influence
where
equality
of
rank
is
affectedly
acknowledged
by
the
rich
and
clamourously
claimed
by
the
poor
distinction
and
preeminence
are
allowed
to
the
clergy
only
this
gives
them
high
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
ladies
i
think
also
that
it
is
from
the
clergy
only
that
the
women
of
america
receive
that
sort
of
attention
which
is
so
dearly
valued
by
every
female
heart
throughout
the
world
with
the
priests
of
america
the
women
hold
that
degree
of
influential
importance
which
in
the
countries
of
europe
is
allowed
them
throughout
all
orders
and
ranks
of
society
except
perhaps
the
very
lowest
and
in
return
for
this
they
seem
to
give
their
hearts
and
souls
into
their
keeping
i
never
saw
or
read
of
any
country
where
religion
had
so
strong
a
hold
upon
the
women
or
a
slighter
hold
upon
the
men
i
mean
not
to
assert
that
i
met
with
no
men
of
sincerely
religious
feelings
or
with
no
women
of
no
religious
feeling
at
all
but
i
feel
perfectly
secure
of
being
correct
as
to
the
great
majority
in
the
statement
i
have
made
we
had
not
been
many
months
in
cincinnati
when
our
curiosity
was
excited
by
hearing
the
revival
talked
of
by
every
one
we
met
throughout
the
town
the
revival
will
be
very
full
we
shall
be
constantly
engaged
during
the
revival
were
the
phrases
we
constantly
heard
repeated
and
for
a
long
time
without
in
the
least
comprehending
what
was
meant
but
at
length
i
learnt
that
the
church
of
america
required
to
be
roused
at
regular
intervals
to
greater
energy
and
exertion
at
these
seasons
the
most
enthusiastic
of
the
clergy
travel
the
country
and
enter
the
cities
and
towns
by
scores
or
by
hundreds
as
the
accommodation
of
the
place
may
admit
and
for
a
week
or
fortnight
or
if
the
population
be
large
for
a
month
they
preach
and
pray
all
day
and
often
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
night
in
the
various
churches
and
chapels
of
the
place
this
is
called
a
revival
i
took
considerable
pains
to
obtain
information
on
this
subject
but
in
detailing
what
i
learnt
i
fear
that
it
is
probable
i
shall
be
accused
of
exaggeration
all
i
can
do
is
cautiously
to
avoid
deserving
it
the
subject
is
highly
interesting
and
it
would
be
a
fault
of
no
trifling
nature
to
treat
it
with
levity
these
itinerant
clergymen
are
of
all
persuasions
i
believe
except
the
episcopalian
catholic
unitarian
and
quaker
i
heard
of
presbyterians
of
all
varieties
of
baptists
of
i
know
not
how
many
divisions
and
of
methodists
of
more
denominations
than
i
can
remember
whose
innumerable
shades
of
varying
belief
it
would
require
much
time
to
explain
and
more
to
comprehend
they
enter
all
the
cities
towns
and
villages
of
the
union
in
succession
i
could
not
learn
with
sufficient
certainty
to
repeat
what
the
interval
generally
is
between
their
visits
these
itinerants
are
for
the
most
part
lodged
in
the
houses
of
their
respective
followers
and
every
evening
that
is
not
spent
in
the
churches
and
is
devoted
to
what
would
be
called
parties
by
others
but
which
they
designate
as
prayer
meetings
here
they
eat
drink
pray
sing
hear
confessions
and
make
converts
to
these
meetings
i
never
got
invited
and
therefore
i
have
nothing
but
hearsay
evidence
to
offer
but
my
information
comes
from
an
and
one
on
whom
i
believe
i
may
depend
if
one
half
of
what
i
heard
may
be
believed
these
social
prayer
meetings
are
by
no
means
the
most
curious
or
the
least
important
part
of
the
business
it
is
impossible
not
to
smile
at
the
close
resemblance
to
be
traced
between
the
feelings
of
a
presbyterian
or
methodist
lady
fortunate
enough
to
have
secured
a
favourite
itinerant
for
her
meeting
and
those
of
a
london
blue
equally
blest
in
the
presence
of
a
fashionable
poet
there
is
a
strong
family
likeness
among
us
all
the
world
over
the
best
rooms
the
best
dresses
the
choicest
refreshments
solemnize
the
meeting
while
the
party
is
assembling
the
of
the
hour
is
occupied
in
whispering
conversations
with
the
guests
as
they
arrive
they
are
called
brothers
and
sisters
and
the
greetings
are
very
affectionate
when
the
room
is
full
the
company
of
whom
a
vast
majority
are
always
women
are
invited
intreated
and
coaxed
to
confess
before
their
brothers
and
sisters
all
their
thoughts
faults
and
follies
these
confessions
are
strange
scenes
the
more
they
confess
the
more
invariably
are
they
encouraged
and
caressed
when
this
is
over
they
all
kneel
and
the
itinerant
prays
extempore
they
then
eat
and
drink
and
then
they
sing
hymns
pray
exhort
sing
and
pray
again
till
the
excitement
reaches
a
very
high
pitch
indeed
these
scenes
are
going
on
at
some
house
or
other
every
evening
during
the
revival
nay
at
many
at
the
same
time
for
the
churches
and
can
not
give
occupation
to
half
the
itinerants
though
they
are
all
open
throughout
the
day
and
till
a
late
hour
in
the
night
and
the
officiating
ministers
succeed
each
other
in
the
occupation
of
them
it
was
at
the
principal
of
the
presbyterian
churches
that
i
was
twice
witness
to
scenes
that
made
me
shudder
in
describing
one
i
describe
both
and
every
one
the
same
thing
is
constantly
repeated
it
was
in
the
middle
of
summer
but
the
service
we
were
recommended
to
attend
did
not
begin
till
it
was
dark
the
church
was
well
lighted
and
crowded
almost
to
suffocation
on
entering
we
found
three
priests
standing
side
by
side
in
a
sort
of
tribune
placed
where
the
altar
usually
is
handsomely
fitted
up
with
crimson
curtains
and
elevated
about
as
high
as
our
pulpits
we
took
our
places
in
a
pew
close
to
the
rail
which
surrounded
it
the
priest
who
stood
in
the
middle
was
praying
the
prayer
was
extravagantly
vehement
and
offensively
familiar
in
expression
when
this
ended
a
hymn
was
sung
and
then
another
priest
took
the
centre
place
and
preached
the
sermon
had
considerable
eloquence
but
of
a
frightful
kind
the
preacher
described
with
ghastly
minuteness
the
last
feeble
fainting
moments
of
human
life
and
then
the
gradual
progress
of
decay
after
death
which
he
followed
through
every
process
up
to
the
last
loathsome
stage
of
decomposition
suddenly
changing
his
tone
which
had
been
that
of
sober
accurate
description
into
the
shrill
voice
of
horror
he
bent
forward
his
head
as
if
to
gaze
on
some
object
beneath
the
pulpit
and
as
rebecca
made
known
to
ivanhoe
what
she
saw
through
the
window
so
the
preacher
made
known
to
us
what
he
saw
in
the
pit
that
seemed
to
open
before
him
the
device
was
certainly
a
happy
one
for
giving
effect
to
his
description
of
hell
no
image
that
fire
flame
brimestone
molten
lead
or
pincers
could
supply
with
flesh
nerves
and
sinews
quivering
under
them
was
omitted
the
perspiration
ran
in
streams
from
the
face
of
the
preacher
his
eyes
rolled
his
lips
were
covered
with
foam
and
every
feature
had
the
deep
expression
of
horror
it
would
have
borne
had
he
in
truth
been
gazing
at
the
scene
he
described
the
acting
was
excellent
at
length
he
gave
a
languishing
look
to
his
supporters
on
each
side
as
if
to
express
his
feeble
state
and
then
sat
down
and
wiped
the
drops
of
agony
from
his
brow
the
other
two
priests
arose
and
began
to
sing
a
hymn
it
was
some
seconds
before
the
congregation
could
join
as
usual
every
upturned
face
looked
pale
and
horror
struck
when
the
singing
ended
another
took
the
centre
place
and
began
in
a
sort
of
coaxing
affectionate
tone
to
ask
the
congregation
if
what
their
dear
brother
had
spoken
had
reached
their
hearts
whether
they
would
avoid
the
hell
he
had
made
them
see
come
then
he
continued
stretching
out
his
arms
towards
them
come
to
us
and
tell
us
so
and
we
will
make
you
see
jesus
the
dear
gentle
jesus
who
shall
save
you
from
it
but
you
must
come
to
him
you
must
not
be
ashamed
to
come
to
him
this
night
you
shall
tell
him
that
you
are
not
ashamed
of
him
we
will
make
way
for
you
we
will
clear
the
bench
for
anxious
sinners
to
sit
upon
come
then
come
to
the
anxious
bench
and
we
will
shew
you
jesus
come
come
come
again
a
hymn
was
sung
and
while
it
continued
one
of
the
three
was
employed
in
clearing
one
or
two
long
benches
that
went
across
the
rail
sending
the
people
back
to
the
lower
part
of
the
church
the
singing
ceased
and
again
the
people
were
invited
and
exhorted
not
to
be
ashamed
of
jesus
but
to
put
themselves
upon
the
anxious
benches
and
lay
their
heads
on
his
bosom
once
more
we
will
sing
he
concluded
that
we
may
give
you
time
and
again
they
sung
a
hymn
and
now
in
every
part
of
the
church
a
movement
was
perceptible
slight
at
first
but
by
degrees
becoming
more
decided
young
girls
arose
and
sat
down
and
rose
again
and
then
the
pews
opened
and
several
came
tottering
out
their
hands
clasped
their
heads
hanging
on
their
bosoms
and
every
limb
trembling
and
still
the
hymn
went
on
but
as
the
poor
creatures
approached
the
rail
their
sobs
and
groans
became
audible
they
seated
themselves
on
the
anxious
benches
the
hymn
ceased
and
two
of
the
three
priests
walked
down
from
the
tribune
and
going
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
began
whispering
to
the
poor
tremblers
seated
there
these
whispers
were
inaudible
to
us
but
the
sobs
and
groans
increased
to
a
frightful
excess
young
creatures
with
features
pale
and
distorted
fell
on
their
knees
on
the
pavement
and
soon
sunk
forward
on
their
faces
the
most
violent
cries
and
shrieks
followed
while
from
time
to
time
a
voice
was
heard
in
convulsive
accents
exclaiming
oh
lord
oh
lord
jesus
help
me
jesus
and
the
like
meanwhile
the
two
priests
continued
to
walk
among
them
they
repeatedly
mounted
on
the
benches
and
proclaimed
to
the
whole
congregation
the
tidings
of
salvation
and
then
from
every
corner
of
the
building
arose
in
reply
short
sharp
cries
of
amen
glory
amen
while
the
prostrate
penitents
continued
to
receive
whispered
comfortings
and
from
time
to
time
a
mystic
caress
more
than
once
i
saw
a
young
neck
encircled
by
a
reverend
arm
violent
hysterics
and
convulsions
seized
many
of
them
and
when
the
tumult
was
at
the
highest
the
priest
who
remained
above
again
gave
out
a
hymn
as
if
to
drown
it
it
was
a
frightful
sight
to
behold
innocent
young
creatures
in
the
gay
morning
of
existence
thus
seized
upon
horror
struck
and
rendered
feeble
and
enervated
for
ever
one
young
girl
apparently
not
more
than
fourteen
was
supported
in
the
arms
of
another
some
years
older
her
face
was
pale
as
death
her
eyes
wide
open
and
perfectly
devoid
of
meaning
her
chin
and
bosom
wet
with
slaver
she
had
every
appearance
of
idiotism
i
saw
a
priest
approach
her
he
took
her
delicate
hand
jesus
is
with
her
bless
the
lord
he
said
and
passed
on
did
the
men
of
america
value
their
women
as
men
ought
to
value
their
wives
and
daughters
would
such
scenes
be
permitted
among
them
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
all
who
obeyed
the
call
to
place
themselves
on
the
anxious
benches
were
women
and
by
far
the
greater
number
very
young
women
the
congregation
was
in
general
extremely
well
dressed
and
the
smartest
and
most
fashionable
ladies
of
the
town
were
there
during
the
whole
revival
the
churches
and
were
every
day
crowded
with
well
dressed
people
it
is
thus
the
ladies
of
cincinnati
amuse
themselves
to
attend
the
theatre
is
forbidden
to
play
cards
is
unlawful
but
they
work
hard
in
their
families
and
must
have
some
relaxation
for
myself
i
confess
that
i
think
the
coarsest
comedy
ever
written
would
be
a
less
detestable
exhibition
for
the
eyes
of
youth
and
innocence
than
such
a
scene
chapter
schools
climate

fourth

flint
literature
cincinnati
contains
many
schools
but
of
their
rank
or
merit
i
had
very
little
opportunity
of
judging
the
only
one
which
i
visited
was
kept
by
dr
lock
a
gentleman
who
appears
to
have
liberal
and
enlarged
opinions
on
the
subject
of
female
education
should
his
system
produce
practical
results
proportionably
excellent
the
ladies
of
cincinnati
will
probably
some
years
hence
be
much
improved
in
their
powers
of
companionship
i
attended
the
annual
public
exhibition
at
this
school
and
perceived
with
some
surprise
that
the
higher
branches
of
science
were
among
the
studies
of
the
pretty
creatures
i
saw
assembled
there
one
lovely
girl
of
sixteen
took
her
degree
in
mathematics
and
another
was
examined
in
moral
philosophy
they
blushed
so
sweetly
and
looked
so
beautifully
puzzled
and
confounded
that
it
might
have
been
difficult
for
an
abler
judge
than
i
was
to
decide
how
far
they
merited
the
diploma
they
received
this
method
of
letting
young
ladies
graduate
and
granting
them
diplomas
on
quitting
the
establishment
was
quite
new
to
me
at
least
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
of
any
thing
similar
elsewhere
i
should
fear
that
the
time
allowed
to
the
fair
graduates
of
cincinnati
for
the
acquirement
of
these
various
branches
of
education
would
seldom
be
sufficient
to
permit
their
reaching
the
eminence
in
each
which
their
enlightened
instructor
anticipates
a
quarter
mathematics
or
two
quarters
political
economy
moral
philosophy
algebra
and
quadratic
equations
would
seldom
i
should
think
enable
the
teacher
and
the
scholar
by
their
joint
efforts
to
lay
in
such
a
stock
of
these
sciences
as
would
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
half
a
score
of
children
and
one
help
towards
the
end
of
may
we
began
to
feel
that
we
were
in
a
climate
warmer
than
any
we
had
been
accustomed
to
and
my
son
suffered
severely
from
the
effects
of
it
a
bilious
complaint
attended
by
a
frightful
degree
of
fever
seized
him
and
for
some
days
we
feared
for
his
life
the
treatment
he
received
was
i
have
no
doubt
judicious
but
the
quantity
of
calomel
prescribed
was
enormous
i
asked
one
day
how
many
grains
i
should
prepare
and
was
told
to
give
half
a
teaspoonful
the
difference
of
climate
must
i
imagine
make
a
difference
in
the
effect
of
this
drug
or
the
practice
of
the
old
and
new
world
could
hardly
differ
so
widely
as
it
does
in
the
use
of
it
anstey
speaking
of
the
bath
physicians
says
no
one
viewed
any
one
of
the
medical
gentlemen
stewed
but
i
can
vouch
upon
my
own
experience
that
no
similar
imputation
lies
against
the
gentlemen
who
prescribe
large
quantities
of
calomel
in
america
to
give
one
instance
in
proof
of
this
when
i
was
afterwards
in
montgomery
county
near
washington
a
physician
attended
one
of
our
neighbours
and
complained
that
he
was
himself
unwell
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
doctor
said
the
patient
i
do
so
he
replied
i
took
forty
grains
of
calomel
yesterday
and
i
feel
better
than
i
did
repeated
and
violent
bleeding
was
also
had
recourse
to
in
the
case
of
my
son
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
able
to
leave
his
room
but
he
was
dreadfully
emaciated
and
it
was
many
weeks
before
he
recovered
his
strength
as
the
heat
of
the
weather
increased
we
heard
of
much
sickness
around
us
the
city
is
full
of
physicians
and
they
were
all
to
be
seen
driving
about
in
their
cabs
at
a
very
alarming
rate
one
of
these
gentlemen
told
us
that
when
a
medical
man
intended
settling
in
a
new
situation
he
always
if
he
knew
his
business
walked
through
the
streets
at
nights
before
he
decided
if
he
saw
the
dismal
twinkle
of
the
from
many
windows
he
might
be
sure
that
disease
was
busy
and
the
the
location
might
suit
him
well
judging
by
this
criterion
cincinnati
was
far
from
healthy
i
began
to
fear
for
our
health
and
determined
to
leave
the
city
but
for
a
considerable
time
i
found
it
impossible
to
procure
a
dwelling
out
of
it
there
were
many
in
the
vicinity
but
they
were
all
overflowing
with
guests
we
were
advised
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
walking
out
in
the
heat
of
the
day
but
the
mornings
and
evenings
were
delightful
particularly
the
former
if
taken
sufficiently
early
for
several
weeks
i
was
never
in
bed
after
four
and
at
this
hour
i
almost
daily
accompanied
my
help
to
market
where
the
busy
novelty
of
the
scene
afforded
me
much
amusement
many
of
enormous
were
brought
to
market
every
day
and
i
was
sure
to
see
groups
of
men
women
and
children
seated
on
the
pavement
round
the
spot
where
they
were
sold
sucking
in
prodigious
quantities
of
this
their
manner
of
devouring
them
is
extremely
unpleasant
the
huge
fruit
is
cut
into
half
a
dozen
sections
of
about
a
foot
long
and
then
dripping
as
it
is
with
water
applied
to
the
mouth
from
either
side
of
which
pour
copious
streams
of
the
fluid
while
ever
and
anon
a
mouthful
of
the
hard
black
seeds
are
shot
out
in
all
directions
to
the
great
annoyance
of
all
within
reach
when
i
first
tasted
this
fruit
i
thought
it
very
vile
stuff
indeed
but
before
the
end
of
the
season
we
all
learned
to
like
it
when
taken
with
claret
and
sugar
it
makes
delicious
wine
and
water
it
is
the
custom
for
the
gentlemen
to
go
to
market
at
cincinnati
the
smartest
men
in
the
place
and
those
of
the
highest
standing
do
not
scruple
to
leave
their
beds
with
the
sun
six
days
in
the
week
and
prepared
with
a
mighty
basket
to
sally
forth
in
search
of
meat
butter
eggs
and
vegetables
i
have
continually
seen
them
returning
with
their
weighty
basket
on
one
arm
and
an
enormous
ham
depending
from
the
other
and
now
arrived
the
of
july
that
greatest
of
all
american
festivals
on
the
of
july
the
declaration
of
their
independence
was
signed
at
the
in
philadelphia
to
me
the
dreary
coldness
and
want
of
enthusiasm
in
american
manners
is
one
of
their
greatest
defects
and
i
therefore
hailed
the
demonstrations
of
general
feeling
which
this
day
elicits
with
real
pleasure
on
the
of
july
the
hearts
of
the
people
seem
to
awaken
from
a
three
hundred
and
days
sleep
they
appear
gay
animated
social
generous
or
at
least
liberal
in
expense
and
would
they
but
refrain
from
spitting
on
that
hallowed
day
i
should
say
that
on
the
of
july
at
least
they
appeared
to
be
an
amiable
people
it
is
true
that
the
women
have
but
little
to
do
with
the
pageantry
the
splendour
or
the
gaiety
of
the
day
but
setting
this
defect
aside
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
sight
to
behold
a
jubilee
so
heartfelt
as
this
and
had
they
not
the
bad
taste
and
bad
feeling
to
utter
an
annual
oration
with
unvarying
abuse
of
the
mother
country
to
say
nothing
of
the
warlike
manifesto
called
declaration
of
independence
our
gracious
king
himself
might
look
upon
the
scene
and
say
that
it
was
good
nay
even
rejoice
that
twelve
millions
of
bustling
bodies
at
four
thousand
miles
distance
from
his
throne
and
his
altars
should
make
their
own
laws
and
drink
their
own
tea
after
the
fashion
that
pleased
them
best
one
source
of
deep
interest
to
us
in
this
new
clime
was
the
frequent
recurrence
of
thunderstorms
those
who
have
only
listened
to
thunder
in
england
have
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
language
which
the
gods
speak
when
they
are
angry
description
however
will
do
it
is
hardly
possible
that
words
can
better
paint
the
spectacle
or
more
truly
echo
to
the
sound
than
his
do
the
only
point
he
does
not
reach
is
the
vast
blaze
of
light
that
ever
and
anon
sets
the
landscape
on
fire
in
reading
this
celebrated
description
in
america
and
observing
how
admirably
true
it
was
to
nature
there
i
seemed
to
get
a
glimpse
at
a
poet
machinery
and
to
perceive
that
in
order
to
produce
effect
he
must
give
his
images
more
vast
than
he
finds
them
in
nature
but
the
proportions
must
be
just
and
the
colouring
true
every
thing
seems
colossal
on
this
great
continent
if
it
rains
if
it
blows
if
it
thunders
it
is
all
done
but
i
often
felt
terror
yield
to
wonder
and
delight
so
grand
so
glorious
were
the
scenes
a
storm
exhibited
accidents
are
certainly
more
frequent
than
with
us
but
not
so
much
so
as
reasonably
to
bring
terror
home
to
one
bosom
every
time
a
mass
of
lurid
clouds
is
seen
rolling
up
against
the
wind
it
seems
hardly
fair
to
quarrel
with
a
place
because
its
staple
commodity
is
not
pretty
but
i
am
sure
i
should
have
liked
cincinnati
much
better
if
the
people
had
not
dealt
so
very
largely
in
hogs
the
immense
quantity
of
business
done
in
this
line
would
hardly
be
believed
by
those
who
had
not
witnessed
it
i
never
saw
a
newspaper
without
remarking
such
advertisements
as
the
following
wanted
immediately
fat
hogs
for
sale
barrels
of
prime
pork
but
the
annoyance
came
nearer
than
this
if
i
determined
upon
a
walk
up
the
chances
were
five
hundred
to
one
against
my
reaching
the
shady
side
without
brushing
by
a
snout
fresh
dripping
from
the
kennel
when
we
had
screwed
our
courage
to
the
enterprise
of
mounting
a
certain
noble
looking
hill
that
promised
pure
air
and
a
fine
view
we
found
the
brook
we
had
to
cross
at
its
foot
red
with
the
stream
from
a
pig
slaughter
house
while
our
noses
instead
of
meeting
the
thyme
that
loves
the
green
hill
breast
were
greeted
by
odours
that
i
will
not
describe
and
which
i
heartily
hope
my
readers
can
not
imagine
our
feet
that
on
leaving
the
city
had
expected
to
press
the
flowery
sod
literally
got
entangled
in
pigs
tails
and
and
thus
the
prettiest
walk
in
the
neighbourhood
was
interdicted
for
ever
one
of
the
sights
to
stare
at
in
america
is
that
of
houses
moving
from
place
to
place
we
were
often
amused
by
watching
this
exhibition
of
mechanical
skill
in
the
streets
they
make
no
difficulty
of
moving
dwellings
from
one
part
of
the
town
to
another
those
i
saw
travelling
were
all
of
them
that
is
built
wholly
of
wood
except
the
chimneys
but
it
is
said
that
brick
buildings
are
sometimes
treated
in
the
same
manner
the
largest
dwelling
that
i
saw
in
motion
was
one
containing
two
stories
of
four
rooms
each
forty
oxen
were
yoked
to
it
the
first
few
yards
brought
down
the
two
stacks
of
chimneys
but
it
afterwards
went
on
well
the
great
difficulties
were
the
first
getting
it
in
motion
and
the
stopping
exactly
in
the
right
place
this
locomotive
power
was
extremely
convenient
at
cincinnati
as
the
constant
improvements
going
on
there
made
it
often
desirable
to
change
a
wooden
dwelling
for
one
of
brick
and
whenever
this
happened
we
were
sure
to
see
the
ex
of
or
the
ex
of
second
street
creeping
quietly
out
of
town
to
take
possession
of
a
humble
suburban
station
on
the
common
above
it
the
most
agreeable
acquaintance
i
made
in
cincinnati
and
indeed
one
of
the
most
talented
men
i
ever
met
was
flint
the
author
of
several
extremely
clever
volumes
and
the
editor
of
the
western
monthly
review
his
conversational
powers
are
of
the
highest
order
he
is
the
only
person
i
remember
to
have
known
with
first
rate
powers
of
satire
and
even
of
sarcasm
whose
kindness
of
nature
and
of
manner
remained
perfectly
uninjured
in
some
of
his
critical
notices
there
is
a
strength
and
keenness
second
to
nothing
of
the
kind
i
have
ever
read
he
is
a
warm
patriot
and
so
an
american
that
we
could
not
always
be
of
the
same
opinion
on
all
the
subjects
we
discussed
but
whether
it
were
the
force
and
brilliancy
of
his
language
his
genuine
and
manly
sincerity
of
feeling
or
his
bland
and
manner
that
beguiled
me
i
know
not
but
certainly
he
is
the
only
american
i
ever
listened
to
whose
unqualified
praise
of
his
country
did
not
appear
to
me
somewhat
overstrained
and
ridiculous
on
one
occasion
but
not
at
the
house
of
flint
i
passed
an
evening
in
company
with
a
gentleman
said
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
man
of
reading
he
was
also
what
is
called
a
gentleman
and
he
appeared
to
have
pleasure
in
feeling
that
his
claim
to
distinction
was
acknowledged
in
both
capacities
there
was
a
very
amiable
lady
in
the
company
to
whom
he
seemed
to
trust
for
the
development
of
his
celestial
pretensions
and
to
me
he
did
the
honour
of
addressing
most
of
his
terrestrial
superiority
the
difference
between
us
was
that
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
spoke
as
to
a
being
who
if
not
his
equal
was
at
least
deserving
high
distinction
and
he
gave
her
smiles
such
as
michael
might
have
vouchsafed
to
eve
to
me
he
spoke
as
paul
to
the
offending
jews
he
did
not
indeed
shake
his
raiment
at
me
but
he
used
his
so
as
to
answer
the
purpose
and
if
every
sentence
did
not
end
with
i
am
clean
pronounced
by
his
lips
his
tone
his
look
his
action
fully
supplied
the
deficiency
our
poor
lord
byron
as
may
be
supposed
was
the
against
which
every
dart
in
his
black
little
quiver
was
aimed
i
had
never
heard
any
serious
gentleman
talk
of
lord
byron
at
full
length
before
and
i
listened
attentively
it
was
evident
that
the
noble
passages
which
are
graven
on
the
hearts
of
the
genuine
lovers
of
poetry
had
altogether
escaped
the
serious
gentleman
attention
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
he
knew
by
rote
all
those
that
they
wish
the
mighty
master
had
never
written
i
told
him
so
and
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
look
he
gave
me
of
other
authors
his
knowledge
was
very
imperfect
but
his
criticisms
very
amusing
of
pope
he
said
he
is
so
entirely
gone
by
that
in
country
it
is
considered
quite
fustian
to
speak
of
him
but
i
persevered
and
named
the
rape
of
the
lock
as
evincing
some
little
talent
and
being
in
a
tone
that
might
still
hope
for
admittance
in
the
but
on
the
mention
of
this
poem
the
serious
gentleman
became
almost
as
strongly
agitated
as
when
he
talked
of
don
juan
and
i
was
unfeignedly
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
his
feelings
till
he
muttered
with
an
indignant
shake
of
the
handkerchief
the
very
title
at
the
name
of
dryden
he
smiled
and
the
smile
spoke
as
plainly
as
a
smile
could
speak
how
the
old
woman
twaddles
we
only
know
dryden
by
quotations
madam
and
these
indeed
are
found
only
in
books
that
have
long
since
had
their
day
and
shakspeare
sir
shakspeare
madam
is
obscene
and
thank
god
we
are
sufficiently
advanced
to
have
found
it
out
if
we
must
have
the
abomination
of
stage
plays
let
them
at
least
be
marked
by
the
refinement
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
this
was
certainly
being
courant
du
of
massenger
he
knew
nothing
of
ford
he
had
never
heard
gray
had
had
his
day
prior
he
had
never
read
but
understood
he
was
a
very
childish
writer
chaucer
and
spenser
he
tied
in
a
couple
and
dismissed
by
saying
that
he
thought
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
affectation
to
talk
of
authors
who
wrote
in
a
tongue
no
longer
intelligible
this
was
the
most
literary
conversation
i
was
ever
present
at
in
cincinnati
the
pleasant
easy
unpretending
talk
on
all
subjects
which
i
enjoyed
in
flint
family
was
an
exception
to
every
thing
else
i
met
at
cincinnati
in
truth
there
are
many
reasons
which
render
a
very
general
diffusion
of
literature
impossible
in
america
i
can
scarcely
class
the
universal
reading
of
newspapers
as
an
exception
to
this
remark
if
i
could
my
statement
would
be
exactly
the
reverse
and
i
should
say
that
america
beat
the
world
in
letters
the
fact
is
that
throughout
all
ranks
of
society
from
the
successful
merchant
which
is
the
highest
to
the
domestic
serving
man
which
is
the
lowest
they
are
all
too
actively
employed
to
read
except
at
such
broken
moments
as
may
suffice
for
a
peep
at
a
newspaper
it
is
for
this
reason
i
presume
that
every
is
more
or
less
a
magazine
wherein
the
merchant
may
scan
while
he
holds
out
his
hand
for
an
invoice
stanzas
by
hemans
or
a
garbled
extract
from
moore
life
of
byron
the
lawyer
may
study
his
brief
faithfully
and
yet
contrive
to
pick
up
the
valuable
dictum
of
some
american
critic
that
bulwer
novels
are
decidedly
superior
to
sir
walter
scott
nay
even
the
auctioneer
may
find
time
as
he
bustles
to
his
tub
or
his
tribune
to
support
his
pretensions
to
polite
learning
by
glancing
his
quick
eye
over
the
columns
and
reading
that
miss
mitford
descriptions
are
indescribable
if
you
buy
a
yard
of
ribbon
the
shopkeeper
lays
down
his
newspaper
perhaps
two
or
three
to
measure
it
i
have
seen
a
drayman
perched
on
the
shaft
of
his
dray
and
reading
one
newspaper
while
another
was
tucked
under
his
arm
and
i
once
went
into
the
cottage
of
a
country
shoemaker
of
the
name
of
harris
where
i
saw
a
newspaper
half
full
of
original
poetry
directed
to
madison
harris
to
be
sure
of
the
fact
i
asked
the
man
if
his
name
were
madison
yes
madam
madison
franklin
harris
is
my
name
the
last
and
the
lyre
divided
his
time
i
fear
too
equally
for
he
looked
pale
and
poor
this
i
presume
is
what
is
meant
by
the
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
so
boasted
of
in
the
united
states
such
as
it
is
the
diffusion
of
it
is
general
enough
certainly
but
i
greatly
doubt
its
being
advantageous
to
the
population
the
only
reading
men
i
met
with
were
those
who
made
letters
their
profession
and
of
these
there
were
some
who
would
hold
a
higher
rank
in
the
great
republic
not
of
america
but
of
letters
did
they
write
for
persons
less
given
to
the
study
of
magazines
and
newspapers
and
they
might
hold
a
higher
rank
still
did
they
write
for
the
few
and
not
for
the
many
i
was
always
drawing
a
parallel
perhaps
a
childish
one
between
the
external
and
internal
deficiency
of
polish
and
of
elegance
in
the
native
volumes
of
the
country
their
compositions
have
not
that
condensation
of
thought
or
that
elaborate
finish
which
the
consciousness
of
writing
for
the
scholar
and
the
man
of
taste
is
calculated
to
give
nor
have
their
dirty
blue
paper
and
slovenly
the
polished
elegance
that
fits
a
volume
for
the
hand
or
the
eye
of
the
fastidious
epicure
in
literary
enjoyment
the
first
book
i
bought
in
america
was
the
chronicles
of
the
cannongate
in
asking
the
price
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
a
dollar
and
a
half
named
being
about
one
sixth
of
what
i
used
to
pay
for
its
fellows
in
england
but
on
opening
the
grim
pages
it
was
long
before
i
could
again
call
them
cheap
to
be
sure
the
pleasure
of
a
bright
page
ought
to
be
quite
lost
sight
of
in
the
glowing
galloping
bewitching
course
that
the
imagination
sets
out
upon
with
a
new
waverley
novel
and
so
it
was
with
me
till
i
felt
the
want
of
it
and
then
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
confess
how
often
in
turning
the
thin
dusky
pages
my
poor
spirit
paused
in
its
pleasure
to
sigh
for
i
must
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
the
american
quarterly
review
to
the
eye
of
the
body
it
is
in
all
respects
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
english
quarterly
review
chapter
removal
to
the
country
walk
in
the
forest
equality
at
length
my
wish
of
obtaining
a
house
in
the
country
was
gratified
a
very
pretty
cottage
the
residence
of
a
gentleman
who
was
removing
into
town
for
the
convenience
of
his
business
as
a
lawyer
was
to
let
and
i
immediately
secured
it
it
was
situated
in
a
little
village
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
close
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
formerly
mentioned
as
the
northern
boundary
of
it
we
found
ourselves
much
more
comfortable
here
than
in
the
city
the
house
was
pretty
and
commodious
our
were
cool
and
airy
we
had
got
rid
of
the
detestable
mosquitoes
and
we
had
an
that
never
failed
beside
all
this
we
had
the
pleasure
of
gathering
our
tomatoes
from
our
own
garden
and
receiving
our
milk
from
our
own
cow
our
manner
of
life
was
infinitely
more
to
my
taste
than
before
it
gave
us
all
the
privileges
of
rusticity
which
are
fully
as
incompatible
with
a
residence
in
a
little
town
of
western
america
as
with
a
residence
in
london
we
lived
on
terms
of
primaeval
intimacy
with
our
cow
for
if
we
lay
down
on
our
lawn
she
did
not
scruple
to
take
a
sniff
at
the
book
we
were
reading
but
then
she
gave
us
her
own
sweet
breath
in
return
the
verge
of
the
forest
that
rose
opposite
our
windows
was
so
near
that
we
often
used
it
as
an
extra
room
and
there
was
no
one
to
wonder
if
we
went
out
with
no
other
preparation
than
our
parasols
carrying
books
and
work
enough
to
while
away
a
long
summer
day
in
the
shade
the
meadow
that
divided
us
from
it
was
covered
with
a
fine
short
grass
that
continued
for
a
little
way
under
the
trees
making
a
beautiful
carpet
while
sundry
logs
and
stumps
furnished
our
sofas
and
tables
but
even
this
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
us
when
we
first
escaped
from
the
city
and
we
determined
upon
having
a
enjoyment
of
the
wildest
forest
scenery
we
could
find
so
we
packed
up
books
albums
pencils
and
sandwiches
and
despite
a
burning
sun
dragged
up
a
hill
so
steep
that
we
sometimes
fancied
we
could
rest
ourselves
against
it
by
only
leaning
forward
a
little
in
panting
and
in
groaning
we
reached
the
top
hoping
to
be
refreshed
by
the
purest
breath
of
heaven
but
to
have
tasted
the
breath
of
heaven
we
must
have
climbed
yet
farther
even
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
themselves
for
we
soon
found
that
the
air
beneath
them
stirred
not
nor
ever
had
stirred
as
it
seemed
to
us
since
first
it
settled
there
so
heavily
did
it
weigh
upon
our
lungs
still
we
were
determined
to
enjoy
ourselves
and
forward
we
went
crunching
knee
deep
through
aboriginal
leaves
hoping
to
reach
some
spot
less
perfectly
airtight
than
our
wearied
with
the
fruitless
search
we
decided
on
reposing
awhile
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
being
all
considerably
exhausted
the
idea
of
sitting
down
on
this
tempting
log
was
conceived
and
executed
simultaneously
by
the
whole
party
and
the
whole
party
sunk
together
through
its
treacherous
surface
into
a
mass
of
rotten
rubbish
that
had
formed
part
of
the
pith
and
marrow
of
the
eternal
forest
a
hundred
years
before
we
were
by
no
means
the
only
sufferers
by
the
accident
frogs
lizards
locusts
katiedids
beetles
and
hornets
had
the
whole
of
their
various
tenements
disturbed
and
testified
their
displeasure
very
naturally
by
annoying
us
as
much
as
possible
in
return
we
were
bit
we
were
stung
we
were
scratched
and
when
at
last
we
succeeded
in
raising
ourselves
from
the
venerable
ruin
we
presented
as
woeful
a
spectacle
as
can
well
be
imagined
we
shook
our
not
ambrosial
garments
and
panting
with
heat
stings
and
vexation
moved
a
few
paces
from
the
scene
of
our
misfortune
and
again
sat
down
but
this
time
it
was
upon
the
solid
earth
we
had
no
sooner
began
to
chew
the
cud
of
the
bitter
fancy
that
had
beguiled
us
to
these
mountain
solitudes
than
a
new
annoyance
assailed
us
a
cloud
of
mosquitoes
gathered
round
and
while
each
sharp
proboscis
sucked
our
blood
they
teased
us
with
their
humming
chorus
till
we
lost
all
patience
and
started
again
on
our
feet
pretty
firmly
resolved
never
to
try
the
joys
of
an
american
forest
again
the
sun
was
now
in
its
meridian
splendour
but
our
homeward
path
was
short
and
down
hill
so
again
packing
up
our
preparations
for
felicity
we
started
homeward
or
more
properly
speaking
we
started
for
in
looking
for
an
agreeable
spot
in
this
dungeon
forest
we
had
advanced
so
far
from
the
verge
of
the
hill
that
we
had
lost
all
trace
of
the
precise
spot
where
we
had
entered
it
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
multitudes
of
tall
slender
melancholy
stems
as
like
as
peas
and
standing
within
a
foot
of
each
other
the
ground
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
which
certainly
was
not
far
was
covered
with
an
unvaried
bed
of
dried
leaves
no
trace
no
track
no
trail
as
cooper
would
call
it
gave
us
a
hint
which
way
to
turn
and
having
paused
for
a
moment
to
meditate
we
remembered
that
chance
must
decide
for
us
at
last
so
we
set
forward
in
no
very
good
mood
to
encounter
new
misfortunes
we
walked
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
coming
to
a
steep
descent
we
thought
ourselves
extremely
fortunate
and
began
to
scramble
down
nothing
doubting
that
it
was
the
same
we
had
scrambled
up
in
truth
nothing
could
be
more
like
but
alas
things
that
are
like
are
not
the
same
when
we
had
slipped
and
stumbled
down
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
were
able
to
look
beyond
it
we
saw
no
pretty
cottage
with
the
shadow
of
its
beautiful
acacias
coming
forward
to
meet
us
all
was
different
and
what
was
worse
all
was
distant
from
the
spot
where
we
had
hoped
to
be
we
had
come
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
ridge
and
had
now
to
win
our
weary
way
a
distance
of
three
miles
round
its
base
i
believe
we
shall
none
of
us
ever
forget
that
walk
the
bright
glowing
like
heat
of
the
atmosphere
seems
to
scorch
as
i
recall
it
it
was
painful
to
tread
it
was
painful
to
breathe
it
was
painful
to
look
round
every
object
glowed
with
the
reflection
of
the
fierce
tyrant
that
glared
upon
us
from
above
we
got
home
alive
which
agreeably
surprised
us
and
when
our
parched
tongues
again
found
power
of
utterance
we
promised
each
other
faithfully
never
to
propose
any
more
parties
of
pleasure
in
the
grim
forests
of
ohio
we
were
now
in
daily
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
but
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
passed
by
till
we
began
to
fear
some
untoward
circumstance
might
delay
his
coming
till
the
spring
at
last
when
we
had
almost
ceased
to
look
out
for
him
on
the
road
which
led
from
the
town
he
arrived
late
at
night
by
that
which
leads
across
the
country
from
pitzburgh
the
pleasure
we
felt
at
seeing
him
was
greatly
increased
by
his
bringing
with
him
our
eldest
son
which
was
a
happiness
we
had
not
hoped
for
our
walks
and
our
drives
now
became
doubly
interesting
the
young
men
fresh
from
a
public
school
found
america
so
totally
unlike
all
the
nations
with
which
their
reading
had
made
them
acquainted
that
it
was
indeed
a
new
world
to
them
had
they
visited
greece
or
rome
they
would
have
encountered
objects
with
whose
images
their
minds
had
been
long
acquainted
or
had
they
travelled
to
france
or
italy
they
would
have
seen
only
what
daily
conversation
had
already
rendered
familiar
but
at
our
public
schools
america
except
perhaps
as
to
her
geographical
position
is
hardly
better
known
than
fairy
land
and
the
american
character
has
not
been
much
more
deeply
studied
than
that
of
the
anthropophagi
all
therefore
was
new
and
every
thing
amusing
the
extraordinary
familiarity
of
our
poor
neighbours
startled
us
at
first
and
we
hardly
knew
how
to
receive
their
uncouth
advances
or
what
was
expected
of
us
in
return
however
it
sometimes
produced
very
laughable
scenes
upon
one
occasion
two
of
my
children
set
off
upon
an
exploring
walk
up
the
hills
they
were
absent
rather
longer
than
we
expected
and
the
rest
of
our
party
determined
upon
going
out
to
meet
them
we
knew
the
direction
they
had
taken
but
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
enquire
at
a
little
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
if
such
a
pair
had
been
seen
to
pass
a
woman
whose
appearance
more
resembled
a
covent
garden
than
any
thing
else
i
can
remember
came
out
and
answered
my
question
with
the
most
jovial
good
humour
in
the
affirmative
and
prepared
to
join
us
in
our
search
her
look
her
voice
her
manner
were
so
exceedingly
coarse
and
vehement
that
she
almost
frightened
me
she
passed
her
arm
within
mine
and
to
the
inexpressible
amusement
of
my
young
people
she
dragged
me
on
talking
and
questioning
me
without
ceasing
she
lived
but
a
short
distance
from
us
and
i
am
sure
intended
to
be
a
very
good
neighbour
but
her
violent
intimacy
made
me
dread
to
pass
her
door
my
children
including
my
sons
she
always
addressed
by
their
christian
names
excepting
when
she
substituted
the
word
honey
this
familiarity
of
address
however
i
afterwards
found
was
universal
throughout
all
ranks
in
the
united
states
my
general
appellation
amongst
my
neighbours
was
the
english
old
woman
but
in
mentioning
each
other
they
constantly
employed
the
term
lady
and
they
evidently
had
a
pleasure
in
using
it
for
i
repeatedly
observed
that
in
speaking
of
a
neighbour
instead
of
saying
they
described
her
as
the
lady
over
the
way
what
takes
in
washing
or
as
that
there
lady
out
by
the
gulley
what
is
making
trollope
was
as
constantly
called
the
old
man
while
draymen
butchers
boys
and
the
labourers
on
the
canal
were
invariably
denominated
them
gentlemen
nay
we
once
saw
one
of
the
most
gentlemanlike
men
in
cincinnati
introduce
a
fellow
in
dirty
shirt
sleeves
and
all
sorts
of
detestable
et
cetera
to
one
of
his
friends
with
this
formula
d
let
me
introduce
this
gentleman
to
you
our
respective
titles
certainly
were
not
very
important
but
the
eternal
shaking
hands
with
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
was
really
an
annoyance
and
the
more
so
as
the
near
approach
of
the
gentlemen
was
always
redolent
of
whiskey
and
tobacco
but
the
point
where
this
republican
equality
was
the
most
distressing
was
in
the
long
and
frequent
visitations
that
it
produced
no
one
dreams
of
fastening
a
door
in
western
america
i
was
told
that
it
would
be
considered
as
an
affront
by
the
whole
neighbourhood
i
was
thus
exposed
to
perpetual
and
most
vexatious
interruptions
from
people
whom
i
had
often
never
seen
and
whose
names
still
oftener
were
unknown
to
me
those
who
are
native
there
and
to
the
manner
born
seem
to
pass
over
these
annoyances
with
more
skill
than
i
could
ever
acquire
more
than
once
i
have
seen
some
of
my
acquaintance
beset
in
the
same
way
without
appearing
at
all
distressed
by
it
they
continued
their
employment
or
conversation
with
me
much
as
if
no
such
interruption
had
taken
place
when
the
visitor
entered
they
would
say
how
do
you
do
and
shake
hands
tolerable
i
thank
ye
how
be
you
was
the
reply
if
it
was
a
female
she
took
off
her
hat
if
a
male
he
kept
it
on
and
then
taking
possession
of
the
first
chair
in
their
way
they
would
retain
it
for
an
hour
together
without
uttering
another
word
at
length
rising
abruptly
they
would
again
shake
hands
with
well
now
i
must
be
going
i
guess
and
so
take
themselves
off
apparently
well
contented
with
their
reception
i
could
never
attain
this
philosophical
composure
i
could
neither
write
nor
read
and
i
always
fancied
i
must
talk
to
them
i
will
give
the
minutes
of
a
conversation
which
i
once
set
down
after
one
of
their
visits
as
a
specimen
of
their
tone
and
manner
of
speaking
and
thinking
my
visitor
was
a
milkman
well
now
so
you
be
from
the
old
country
ay
you
see
sights
here
i
guess
i
hope
i
shall
see
many
that
a
fact
i
expect
your
little
place
of
an
island
grow
such
dreadful
fine
corn
as
you
sees
here
corn
always
means
indian
corn
or
maize
it
grows
no
corn
at
all
sir
possible
no
wonder
then
that
we
reads
such
awful
stories
in
the
papers
of
your
poor
people
being
starved
to
death
we
have
wheat
however
ay
for
your
rich
folks
but
i
calculate
the
poor
seldom
gets
a
belly
full
you
have
certainly
much
greater
abundance
here
i
expect
so
why
they
do
say
that
if
a
poor
body
contrives
to
be
smart
enough
to
scrape
together
a
few
dollars
that
your
king
george
always
comes
down
upon
and
takes
it
all
away
do
he
i
do
not
remember
hearing
of
such
a
transaction
i
guess
they
be
pretty
close
about
it
your
papers
be
like
ourn
i
reckon
now
we
says
and
prints
just
what
we
likes
you
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
reading
the
newspapers
and
i
like
you
to
tell
me
how
we
can
spend
it
better
how
should
freemen
spend
their
time
but
looking
after
their
government
and
watching
that
them
fellers
as
we
gives
offices
to
doos
their
duty
and
gives
themselves
no
airs
but
i
sometimes
think
sir
that
your
fences
might
be
in
more
thorough
repair
and
your
roads
in
better
order
if
less
time
was
spent
in
politics
the
lord
to
see
how
little
you
knows
of
a
free
country
why
what
the
smoothness
of
a
road
put
against
the
freedom
of
a
american
and
what
does
a
broken
signify
comparable
to
knowing
that
the
men
what
we
have
been
pleased
to
send
up
to
congress
speaks
handsome
and
straight
as
we
chooses
they
should
it
is
from
a
sense
of
duty
then
that
you
all
go
to
the
liquor
store
to
read
the
papers
to
be
sure
it
is
and
he
be
no
true
born
american
as
did
i
do
say
that
the
father
of
a
family
should
always
be
after
liquor
but
i
do
say
that
i
rather
have
my
son
drunk
three
times
in
a
week
than
not
look
after
the
affairs
of
his
country
our
autumn
walks
were
delightful
the
sun
ceased
to
scorch
the
want
of
flowers
was
no
longer
peculiar
to
ohio
and
the
trees
took
a
colouring
which
in
richness
brilliance
and
variety
exceeded
all
description
i
think
it
is
the
maple
or
tree
that
first
sprinkles
the
forest
with
rich
crimson
the
beech
follows
with
all
its
harmony
of
golden
tints
from
pale
yellow
up
to
brightest
orange
the
gives
almost
the
purple
colour
of
the
mulberry
the
chesnut
softens
all
with
its
frequent
mass
of
delicate
brown
and
the
sturdy
oak
carries
its
deep
green
into
the
very
lap
of
winter
these
tints
are
too
bright
for
the
landscape
painter
the
attempt
to
follow
nature
in
an
american
autumn
scene
must
be
abortive
the
colours
are
in
reality
extremely
brilliant
but
the
medium
through
which
they
are
seen
increases
the
effect
surprisingly
of
all
the
points
in
which
america
has
the
advantage
of
england
the
one
i
felt
most
sensibly
was
the
clearness
and
brightness
of
the
atmosphere
by
day
and
by
night
this
exquisite
purity
of
air
gives
tenfold
beauty
to
every
object
i
could
hardly
believe
the
stars
were
the
same
the
great
bear
looked
like
a
constellation
of
suns
and
jupiter
justified
all
the
fine
things
said
of
him
in
those
beautiful
lines
from
i
know
not
what
spirited
pen
beginning
i
looked
on
thee
jove
till
my
gaze
shrunk
smote
by
the
of
thy
blaze
i
always
remarked
that
the
first
silver
line
of
the
crescent
attracted
the
eye
on
the
first
day
in
america
as
strongly
as
it
does
here
on
the
third
i
observed
another
phenomenon
in
the
crescent
moon
of
that
region
the
cause
of
which
i
less
understood
that
appearance
which
shakespear
describes
as
the
new
moon
with
the
old
moon
in
her
lap
and
which
i
have
heard
ingeniously
explained
as
the
effect
of
was
less
visible
there
than
here
cuyp
clearest
landscapes
have
an
atmosphere
that
approaches
nearer
to
that
of
america
than
any
i
remember
on
canvas
but
even
cuyp
can
not
reach
the
lungs
and
therefore
can
only
give
an
idea
of
half
the
enjoyment
for
it
makes
itself
felt
as
well
as
seen
and
is
indeed
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
our
walks
were
however
curtailed
in
several
directions
by
my
old
cincinnati
enemies
the
pigs
immense
droves
of
them
were
continually
arriving
from
the
country
by
the
road
that
led
to
most
of
our
favourite
walks
they
were
often
fed
and
lodged
in
the
prettiest
valleys
and
worse
still
were
slaughtered
beside
the
prettiest
streams
another
evil
threatened
us
from
the
same
quarter
that
was
yet
heavier
our
cottage
had
an
ample
piazza
a
luxury
almost
universal
in
the
country
houses
of
america
which
shaded
by
a
group
of
acacias
made
a
delightful
room
from
this
favourite
spot
we
one
day
perceived
symptoms
of
building
in
a
field
close
to
it
with
much
anxiety
we
hastened
to
the
spot
and
asked
what
building
was
to
be
erected
there
is
to
be
a
slaughter
house
for
hogs
was
the
dreadful
reply
as
there
were
several
gentlemen
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
i
asked
if
such
an
erection
might
not
be
indicted
as
a
nuisance
a
what
a
nuisance
i
repeated
and
explained
what
i
meant
no
no
was
the
reply
that
may
do
very
well
for
your
tyrannical
country
where
a
rich
man
nose
is
more
thought
of
than
a
poor
man
mouth
but
hogs
be
profitable
produce
here
and
we
be
too
free
for
such
a
law
as
that
i
guess
during
my
residence
in
america
little
circumstances
like
the
foregoing
often
recalled
to
my
mind
a
conversation
i
once
held
in
france
with
an
old
gentleman
on
the
subject
of
their
active
police
and
its
omnipresent
gens
croyez
moi
madame
il
a
que
ceux
à
qui
ils
ont
à
faire
qui
les
trouvent
de
trop
and
the
old
gentleman
was
right
not
only
in
speaking
of
france
but
of
the
whole
human
family
as
philosophers
call
us
the
well
disposed
those
whose
own
feeling
of
justice
would
prevent
their
annoying
others
will
never
complain
of
the
restraints
of
the
law
all
the
freedom
enjoyed
in
america
beyond
what
is
enjoyed
in
england
is
enjoyed
solely
by
the
disorderly
at
the
expense
of
the
orderly
and
were
i
a
stout
knight
either
of
the
sword
or
of
the
pen
i
would
fearlessly
throw
down
my
gauntlet
and
challenge
the
whole
republic
to
prove
the
contrary
but
being
as
i
am
a
feeble
looker
on
with
a
needle
for
my
spear
and
i
talk
for
my
device
i
must
be
contented
with
the
power
of
stating
the
fact
perfectly
certain
that
i
shall
be
contradicted
by
one
loud
shout
from
maine
to
georgia
chapter
religion
i
had
often
heard
it
observed
before
i
visited
america
that
one
of
the
great
blessings
of
its
constitution
was
the
absence
of
a
national
religion
the
country
being
thus
exonerated
from
all
obligation
of
supporting
the
clergy
those
only
contributing
to
do
so
whose
principles
led
them
to
it
my
residence
in
the
country
has
shewn
me
that
a
religious
tyranny
may
be
exerted
very
effectually
without
the
aid
of
the
government
in
a
way
much
more
oppressive
than
the
paying
of
tithe
and
without
obtaining
any
of
the
salutary
decorum
which
i
presume
no
one
will
deny
is
the
result
of
an
established
mode
of
worship
as
it
was
impossible
to
remain
many
weeks
in
the
country
without
being
struck
with
the
strange
anomalies
produced
by
its
religious
system
my
early
notes
contain
many
observations
on
the
subject
but
as
nearly
the
same
scenes
recurred
in
every
part
of
the
country
i
state
them
here
not
as
belonging
to
the
west
alone
but
to
the
whole
union
the
same
cause
producing
the
same
effect
every
where
the
whole
people
appear
to
be
divided
into
an
almost
endless
variety
of
religious
factions
and
i
was
told
that
to
be
well
received
in
society
it
was
necessary
to
declare
yourself
as
belonging
to
some
one
of
these
let
your
acknowledged
belief
be
what
it
may
you
are
said
to
be
a
unless
you
attach
yourself
to
a
particular
congregation
besides
the
broad
and
distinctions
of
episcopalian
catholic
presbyterian
calvinist
baptist
quaker
universalist
dunker
there
are
innumerable
others
springing
out
of
these
each
of
which
assumes
a
church
government
of
its
own
of
this
the
most
intriguing
and
factious
individual
is
invariably
the
head
and
in
order
as
it
should
seem
to
shew
a
reason
for
this
separation
each
congregation
invests
itself
with
some
queer
variety
of
external
observance
that
has
the
melancholy
effect
of
exposing
religious
ceremonies
to
contempt
it
is
impossible
in
witnessing
all
these
unseemly
vagaries
not
to
recognise
the
advantages
of
an
established
church
as
a
sort
of
headquarters
for
quiet
unpresuming
christians
who
are
contented
to
serve
faithfully
without
insisting
upon
having
each
a
little
separate
banner
embroidered
with
a
device
of
their
own
imagining
the
catholics
alone
appear
exempt
from
the
fury
of
division
and
that
has
seized
every
other
persuasion
having
the
pope
for
their
common
head
regulates
i
presume
their
movements
and
prevents
the
outrageous
display
of
individual
whim
which
every
other
sect
is
permitted
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
introduced
to
the
catholic
bishop
of
cincinnati
and
have
never
known
in
any
country
a
priest
of
a
character
and
bearing
more
truly
apostolic
he
was
an
american
but
i
should
never
have
discovered
it
from
his
pronunciation
or
manner
he
received
his
education
partly
in
england
and
partly
in
france
his
manners
were
highly
polished
his
piety
active
and
sincere
and
infinitely
more
mild
and
tolerant
than
that
of
the
factious
sectarians
who
form
the
great
majority
of
the
american
priesthood
i
believe
i
am
sufficiently
tolerant
but
this
does
not
prevent
my
seeing
that
the
object
of
all
religious
observances
is
better
obtained
when
the
government
of
the
church
is
confided
to
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
the
most
venerated
among
the
people
than
when
it
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
every
tinker
and
tailor
who
chooses
to
claim
a
share
in
it
nor
is
this
the
only
evil
attending
the
want
of
a
national
religion
supported
by
the
state
as
there
is
no
legal
and
fixed
provision
for
the
clergy
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
their
services
are
confined
to
those
who
can
pay
them
the
vehement
expressions
of
insane
or
hypocritical
zeal
such
as
were
exhibited
during
the
revival
can
but
ill
atone
for
the
want
of
village
worship
any
more
than
the
eternal
talk
of
the
admirable
and
unequalled
government
can
atone
for
the
continual
contempt
of
social
order
church
and
state
hobble
along
side
by
side
notwithstanding
their
boasted
independence
almost
every
man
you
meet
will
tell
you
that
he
is
occupied
in
labours
most
abundant
for
the
good
of
his
country
and
almost
every
woman
will
tell
you
that
besides
those
things
that
are
within
her
house
she
has
coming
upon
her
daily
the
care
of
all
the
churches
yet
spite
of
this
universal
attention
to
the
government
its
laws
are
half
asleep
and
spite
of
the
old
women
and
their
dorcas
societies
atheism
is
awake
and
thriving
in
the
smaller
cities
and
towns
take
the
place
of
almost
all
other
amusements
but
as
the
thinly
scattered
population
of
most
villages
can
give
no
parties
and
pay
no
priests
they
contrive
to
marry
christen
and
bury
without
them
a
stranger
taking
up
his
residence
in
any
city
in
america
must
think
the
natives
the
most
religious
people
upon
earth
but
if
chance
lead
him
among
her
western
villages
he
will
rarely
find
either
churches
or
chapels
prayer
or
preacher
except
indeed
at
that
most
terrific
saturnalia
a
i
was
much
struck
with
the
answer
of
a
poor
woman
whom
i
saw
ironing
on
a
sunday
do
you
make
no
difference
in
your
occupations
on
a
sunday
i
said
i
beant
a
christian
we
have
got
no
opportunity
was
the
reply
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
a
country
where
all
men
are
equal
the
government
would
be
guilty
of
no
great
crime
did
it
so
far
interfere
as
to
give
them
all
of
becoming
christians
if
they
wished
it
but
should
the
federal
government
dare
to
propose
building
a
church
and
endowing
it
in
some
village
that
has
never
heard
the
bringing
home
of
bell
and
burial
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
not
only
the
sovereign
state
where
such
an
abomination
was
proposed
would
rush
into
the
congress
to
resent
the
odious
interference
but
that
all
the
other
states
would
join
the
clamour
and
such
an
intermeddling
administration
would
run
great
risk
of
impeachment
and
degradation
where
there
is
a
so
constituted
as
to
deserve
human
respect
i
believe
it
will
always
be
found
to
receive
it
even
from
those
who
may
not
assent
to
the
dogma
of
its
creed
and
where
such
respect
exists
it
produces
a
decorum
in
manners
and
language
often
found
wanting
where
it
does
not
sectarians
will
not
venture
to
rhapsodise
nor
infidels
to
scoff
in
the
common
intercourse
of
society
both
are
injurious
to
the
cause
of
rational
religion
and
to
check
both
must
be
advantageous
it
is
certainly
possible
that
some
of
the
fanciful
variations
upon
the
ancient
creeds
of
the
christian
church
with
which
transatlantic
religionists
amuse
themselves
might
inspire
morbid
imaginations
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
but
before
they
can
disturb
the
solemn
harmony
here
they
must
prelude
by
a
defiance
not
only
to
common
sense
but
what
is
infinitely
more
appalling
to
common
usage
they
must
at
once
rank
themselves
with
the
low
and
the
illiterate
for
only
such
prefer
the
eloquence
of
the
tub
to
that
of
the
pulpit
the
aristocracy
must
ever
as
a
body
belong
to
the
established
church
and
it
is
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
influential
classes
who
would
be
willing
to
allow
that
they
do
not
belong
to
the
aristocracy
that
such
feelings
influence
the
professions
of
men
it
were
ignorance
or
hypocrisy
to
deny
and
that
nation
is
wise
who
knows
how
to
turn
even
such
feelings
into
a
wholesome
stream
of
popular
influence
as
a
specimen
of
the
tone
in
which
religion
is
mixed
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
society
i
will
transcribe
the
notes
i
took
of
a
conversation
at
which
i
was
present
at
cincinnati
i
wrote
them
immediately
after
the
conversation
took
place
a
i
wish
that
you
would
explain
to
me
what
a
revival
is
i
hear
it
talked
of
all
over
the
city
and
i
know
it
means
something
about
jesus
christ
and
religion
but
that
is
all
i
know
will
you
instruct
me
farther
i
expect
that
you
want
to
laugh
at
me
but
that
makes
no
difference
i
am
firm
in
my
principles
and
i
fear
no
one
laughter
a
well
but
what
is
a
revival
it
is
difficult
very
difficult
to
make
those
see
who
have
no
light
to
make
those
understand
whose
souls
are
darkened
a
revival
means
just
an
elegant
kindling
of
the
spirit
it
is
brought
about
to
the
lord
people
by
the
hands
of
his
saints
and
it
means
salvation
in
the
highest
a
but
what
is
it
the
people
mean
by
talking
of
feeling
the
revival
and
waiting
in
spirit
for
the
revival
and
the
extacy
of
the
revival
oh
doctor
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
too
far
gone
astray
to
understand
all
that
it
is
a
glorious
assurance
a
whispering
of
the
everlasting
covenant
it
is
the
bleating
of
the
lamb
it
is
the
welcome
of
the
shepherd
it
is
the
essence
of
love
it
is
the
fullness
of
glory
it
is
being
in
jesus
it
is
jesus
being
in
us
it
is
taking
the
holy
ghost
into
our
bosoms
it
is
sitting
ourselves
down
by
god
it
is
being
called
to
the
high
places
it
is
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
in
the
lord
it
is
becoming
a
lion
in
the
faith
it
is
being
lowly
and
meek
and
kissing
the
hand
that
smites
it
is
being
mighty
and
powerful
and
scorning
reproof
it
is
a
thank
you
i
feel
quite
satisfied
and
i
think
i
understand
a
revival
now
almost
as
well
as
you
do
yourself
a
my
where
can
you
have
learnt
all
that
stuff
mrs
how
benighted
you
are
from
the
holy
book
from
the
word
of
the
lord
from
the
holy
ghost
and
jesus
christ
themselves
a
it
does
seem
so
droll
to
me
to
hear
you
talk
of
the
word
of
the
lord
why
i
have
been
brought
up
to
look
upon
the
bible
as
nothing
better
than
an
old
newspaper
o
surely
you
only
say
this
for
the
sake
of
hearing
what
will
say
in
return
you
do
not
mean
it
a
la
yes
to
be
sure
i
do
a
i
profess
that
i
by
no
means
wish
my
wife
to
read
all
she
might
find
what
says
the
colonel
mrs
as
to
that
i
never
stop
to
ask
him
i
tell
him
every
day
that
i
believe
in
father
son
and
holy
ghost
and
that
it
is
his
duty
to
believe
in
them
too
and
then
my
conscience
is
clear
and
i
do
care
what
he
believes
really
i
have
no
notion
of
husband
interfering
in
such
matters
a
you
are
quite
right
i
am
sure
i
give
my
wife
leave
to
believe
just
what
she
likes
but
she
is
a
good
woman
and
does
not
abuse
the
liberty
for
she
believes
nothing
it
was
not
once
nor
twice
nor
thrice
but
many
many
times
during
my
residence
in
america
that
i
was
present
when
subjects
which
custom
as
well
as
principle
had
taught
me
to
consider
as
fitter
for
the
closet
than
the
were
thus
lightly
discussed
i
hardly
know
whether
i
was
more
startled
at
first
hearing
in
little
dainty
namby
pamby
tones
a
profession
of
atheism
over
a
teacup
or
at
having
my
attention
called
from
a
johnny
cake
to
a
rhapsody
on
election
and
the
second
birth
but
notwithstanding
this
revolting
license
persecution
exists
to
a
degree
unknown
i
believe
in
our
land
since
the
days
of
cromwell
i
had
the
following
anecdote
from
a
gentleman
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
a
tailor
sold
a
suit
of
clothes
to
a
sailor
a
few
moments
before
he
sailed
which
was
on
a
sunday
morning
the
corporation
of
new
york
prosecuted
the
tailor
and
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
fine
greatly
beyond
his
means
to
pay
a
lawyer
of
new
york
defended
him
with
much
eloquence
but
in
vain
his
powerful
speech
however
was
not
without
effect
for
it
raised
him
such
a
host
of
presbyterian
enemies
as
sufficed
to
destroy
his
practice
nor
was
this
all
his
nephew
was
at
the
time
preparing
for
the
bar
and
soon
after
the
above
circumstance
occurred
his
certificates
were
presented
and
refused
with
this
declaration
that
no
man
of
the
name
and
family
of
should
be
admitted
i
have
met
this
young
man
in
society
he
is
a
person
of
very
considerable
talent
and
being
thus
cruelly
robbed
of
his
profession
has
become
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
chapter
peasantry
compared
to
that
of
england
early
marriages
charity
independence
and
equality
cottage
mohawk
as
our
little
village
was
called
gave
us
an
excellent
opportunity
of
comparing
the
peasants
of
the
united
states
with
those
of
england
and
of
judging
the
average
degree
of
comfort
enjoyed
by
each
i
believe
ohio
gives
as
fair
a
specimen
as
any
part
of
the
union
if
they
have
the
roughness
and
inconveniences
of
a
new
state
to
contend
with
they
have
higher
wages
and
cheaper
provisions
if
i
err
in
supposing
it
a
mean
state
in
point
of
comfort
it
certainly
is
not
in
taking
too
low
a
standard
mechanics
if
good
workmen
are
certain
of
employment
and
good
wages
rather
higher
than
with
us
the
average
wages
of
a
labourer
throughout
the
union
is
ten
dollars
a
month
with
lodging
boarding
washing
and
mending
if
he
lives
at
his
own
expense
he
has
a
dollar
a
day
it
appears
to
me
that
the
necessaries
of
life
that
is
to
say
meat
bread
butter
tea
and
coffee
not
to
mention
whiskey
are
within
the
reach
of
every
sober
industrious
and
healthy
man
who
chooses
to
have
them
and
yet
i
think
that
an
english
peasant
with
the
same
qualifications
would
in
coming
to
the
united
states
change
for
the
worse
he
would
find
wages
somewhat
higher
and
provisions
in
western
america
considerably
lower
but
this
statement
true
as
it
is
can
lead
to
nothing
but
delusion
if
taken
apart
from
other
facts
fully
as
certain
and
not
less
important
but
which
require
more
detail
in
describing
and
which
perhaps
can
not
be
fully
comprehended
except
by
an
the
american
poor
are
accustomed
to
eat
meat
three
times
a
day
i
never
enquired
into
the
habits
of
any
cottagers
in
western
america
where
this
was
not
the
case
i
found
afterwards
in
maryland
pennsylvania
and
other
parts
of
the
country
where
the
price
of
meat
was
higher
that
it
was
used
with
more
economy
yet
still
a
much
larger
portion
of
the
weekly
income
is
thus
expended
than
with
us
ardent
spirits
though
lamentably
cheap
still
cost
something
and
the
use
of
them
among
the
men
with
more
or
less
of
discretion
according
to
the
character
is
universal
tobacco
also
grows
at
their
doors
and
is
not
taxed
yet
this
too
costs
something
and
the
air
of
heaven
is
not
in
more
general
use
among
the
men
of
america
than
chewing
tobacco
i
am
not
now
pointing
out
the
evils
of
but
it
is
evident
that
where
this
practice
prevails
universally
and
often
to
the
most
frightful
excess
the
consequence
must
be
that
the
money
spent
to
obtain
the
dram
is
less
than
the
money
lost
by
the
time
consumed
in
drinking
it
long
disabling
and
expensive
fits
of
sickness
are
incontestably
more
frequent
in
every
part
of
america
than
in
england
and
the
sufferers
have
no
aid
to
look
to
but
what
they
have
saved
or
what
they
may
be
enabled
to
sell
i
have
never
seen
misery
exceed
what
i
have
witnessed
in
an
american
cottage
where
disease
has
entered
about
a
shilling
a
gallon
is
the
retail
price
of
good
whiskey
if
bought
wholesale
or
of
inferior
quality
it
is
much
cheaper
but
if
the
condition
of
the
labourer
be
not
superior
to
that
of
the
english
peasant
that
of
his
wife
and
daughters
is
incomparably
worse
it
is
they
who
are
indeed
the
slaves
of
the
soil
one
has
but
to
look
at
the
wife
of
an
american
cottager
and
ask
her
age
to
be
convinced
that
the
life
she
leads
is
one
of
hardship
privation
and
labour
it
is
rare
to
see
a
woman
in
this
station
who
has
reached
the
age
of
thirty
without
losing
every
trace
of
youth
and
beauty
you
continually
see
women
with
infants
on
their
knee
that
you
feel
sure
are
their
children
till
some
convincing
proof
of
the
contrary
is
displayed
even
the
young
girls
though
often
with
lovely
features
look
pale
thin
and
haggard
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
in
any
single
instance
among
the
poor
a
specimen
of
the
plump
rosy
laughing
physiognomy
so
common
among
our
cottage
girls
the
horror
of
domestic
service
which
the
reality
of
slavery
and
the
fable
of
equality
have
generated
excludes
the
young
women
from
that
sure
and
most
comfortable
resource
of
decent
english
girls
and
the
consequence
is
that
with
a
most
irreverend
freedom
of
manner
to
the
parents
the
daughters
are
to
the
full
extent
of
the
word
domestic
slaves
this
condition
which
no
periodical
no
village
fête
ever
occurs
to
cheer
is
only
changed
for
the
still
sadder
burdens
of
a
teeming
wife
they
marry
very
young
in
fact
in
no
rank
of
life
do
you
meet
with
young
women
in
that
delightful
period
of
existence
between
childhood
and
marriage
wherein
if
only
tolerably
well
spent
so
much
useful
information
is
gained
and
the
character
takes
a
sufficient
degree
of
firmness
to
support
with
dignity
the
more
important
parts
of
wife
and
mother
the
slender
childish
thing
without
vigour
of
mind
or
body
is
made
to
stem
a
sea
of
troubles
that
dims
her
young
eye
and
makes
her
cheek
grow
pale
even
before
nature
has
given
it
the
last
beautiful
finish
of
the
woman
we
shall
get
along
is
the
answer
in
full
for
all
that
can
be
said
in
way
of
advice
to
a
boy
and
girl
who
take
it
into
their
heads
to
go
before
a
magistrate
and
get
married
and
they
do
get
along
till
sickness
overtakes
them
by
means
perhaps
of
borrowing
a
kettle
from
one
and
a
from
another
but
intemperance
idleness
or
sickness
will
in
one
week
plunge
those
who
are
even
getting
along
well
into
utter
destitution
and
where
this
happens
they
are
completely
without
resource
the
absence
of
is
without
doubt
a
blessing
to
the
country
but
they
have
not
that
natural
and
reasonable
dependence
on
the
richer
classes
which
in
countries
differently
constituted
may
so
well
supply
their
place
i
suppose
there
is
less
in
america
than
in
any
other
christian
country
on
the
face
of
the
globe
it
is
not
in
the
temper
of
the
people
either
to
give
or
to
receive
i
extract
the
following
pompous
passage
from
a
washington
paper
of
a
season
of
uncommon
severity
and
distress
which
i
think
justifies
my
observation
among
the
liberal
evidences
of
sympathy
for
the
suffering
poor
of
this
city
two
have
come
to
our
knowledge
which
deserve
to
be
especially
noticed
the
one
a
donation
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
the
committee
of
the
ward
in
which
he
resides
of
fifty
dollars
the
other
the
donation
by
a
few
of
the
officers
of
the
war
department
to
the
howard
and
dorcas
societies
of
dollars
when
such
mention
is
made
of
a
gift
of
about
nine
pounds
sterling
from
the
sovereign
magistrate
of
the
united
states
and
of
thirteen
pounds
sterling
as
a
contribution
from
one
of
the
state
departments
the
inference
is
pretty
obvious
that
the
sufferings
of
the
destitute
in
america
are
not
liberally
relieved
by
individual
charity
i
had
not
been
three
days
at
before
a
pair
of
ragged
children
came
to
ask
for
medicine
for
a
sick
mother
and
when
it
was
given
to
them
the
eldest
produced
a
handful
of
cents
and
desired
to
know
what
he
was
to
pay
the
superfluous
milk
of
our
cow
was
sought
after
eagerly
but
every
new
comer
always
proposed
to
pay
for
it
when
they
found
out
that
the
english
old
woman
did
not
sell
anything
i
am
persuaded
they
by
no
means
liked
her
the
better
for
it
but
they
seemed
to
think
that
if
she
were
a
fool
it
was
no
reason
they
should
be
so
too
and
accordingly
the
borrowing
as
they
called
it
became
very
constant
but
always
in
a
form
that
shewed
their
dignity
and
freedom
one
woman
sent
to
borrow
a
pound
of
cheese
another
half
a
pound
of
coffee
and
more
than
once
an
intimation
accompanied
the
that
the
milk
must
be
fresh
and
unskimmed
on
one
occasion
the
messenger
refused
milk
and
said
mother
only
wanted
a
little
cream
for
her
coffee
i
could
never
teach
them
to
believe
during
above
a
year
that
i
lived
at
this
house
that
i
would
not
sell
the
old
clothes
of
the
family
and
so
pertinacious
were
they
in
that
often
when
i
had
given
them
the
articles
which
they
wanted
to
purchase
they
would
say
well
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
do
a
turn
of
work
for
this
you
may
send
for
me
when
you
want
me
but
as
i
never
did
ask
for
the
turn
of
work
and
as
this
formula
was
constantly
repeated
i
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
spoken
solely
to
avoid
uttering
the
most
phrase
i
thank
you
there
was
one
man
whose
progress
in
wealth
i
watched
with
much
interest
and
pleasure
when
i
first
became
his
neighbour
himself
his
wife
and
four
children
were
living
in
one
room
with
plenty
of
and
onions
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
but
with
very
few
other
comforts
he
was
one
of
the
finest
men
i
ever
saw
full
of
natural
intelligence
and
activity
of
mind
and
body
but
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
drank
but
little
whiskey
and
but
rarely
chewed
tobacco
and
was
therefore
more
free
from
that
plague
spot
of
spitting
which
rendered
male
colloquy
so
difficult
to
endure
he
worked
for
us
frequently
and
often
used
to
walk
into
the
and
seat
himself
on
the
sofa
and
tell
me
all
his
plans
he
made
an
engagement
with
the
proprietor
of
the
wooded
hill
before
mentioned
by
which
half
the
wood
he
could
fell
was
to
be
his
own
his
unwearied
industry
made
this
a
profitable
bargain
and
from
the
proceeds
he
purchased
the
materials
for
building
a
comfortable
frame
or
wooden
house
he
did
the
work
almost
entirely
himself
he
then
got
a
job
for
cutting
rails
and
as
he
could
cut
twice
as
many
in
a
day
as
any
other
man
in
the
neighbourhood
he
made
a
good
thing
of
it
he
then
let
half
his
pretty
house
which
was
admirably
constructed
with
an
ample
portico
that
kept
it
always
cool
his
next
step
was
contracting
for
the
building
a
wooden
bridge
and
when
i
left
mohawk
he
had
fitted
up
his
half
of
the
building
as
an
hotel
and
grocery
store
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
every
sun
that
sets
sees
him
a
richer
man
than
when
it
rose
he
hopes
to
make
his
son
a
lawyer
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
will
live
to
see
him
sit
in
congress
when
this
time
arrives
the
son
will
rank
with
any
other
member
of
congress
not
of
courtesy
but
of
right
and
the
idea
that
his
origin
is
a
disadvantage
will
never
occur
to
the
imagination
of
the
most
exalted
of
his
this
is
the
only
feature
in
american
society
that
i
recognise
as
indicative
of
the
equality
they
profess
any
man
son
may
become
the
equal
of
any
other
man
son
and
the
consciousness
of
this
is
certainly
a
spur
to
exertion
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
a
spur
to
that
coarse
familiarity
untempered
by
any
shadow
of
respect
which
is
assumed
by
the
grossest
and
the
lowest
in
their
intercourse
with
the
highest
and
most
refined
this
is
a
positive
evil
and
i
think
more
than
balances
its
advantages
and
here
again
it
may
be
observed
that
the
theory
of
equality
may
be
very
daintily
discussed
by
english
gentlemen
in
a
london
when
the
servant
having
placed
a
fresh
bottle
of
cool
wine
on
the
table
respectfully
shuts
the
door
and
leaves
them
to
their
walnuts
and
their
wisdom
but
it
will
be
found
less
palatable
when
it
presents
itself
in
the
shape
of
a
hard
greasy
paw
and
is
claimed
in
accents
that
breathe
less
of
freedom
than
of
onions
and
whiskey
strong
indeed
must
be
the
love
of
equality
in
an
english
breast
if
it
can
survive
a
tour
through
the
union
there
was
one
house
in
the
village
which
was
remarkable
from
its
wretchedness
it
had
an
air
of
indecent
poverty
about
it
which
long
prevented
my
attempting
an
entrance
but
at
length
upon
being
told
that
i
could
get
chicken
and
eggs
there
whenever
i
wanted
them
i
determined
upon
venturing
the
door
being
opened
to
my
knock
i
very
nearly
abandoned
my
almost
blunted
purpose
i
never
beheld
such
a
den
of
filth
and
misery
a
woman
the
very
image
of
dirt
and
disease
held
a
squalid
imp
of
a
baby
on
her
hip
bone
while
she
kneaded
her
dough
with
her
right
fist
only
a
great
lanky
girl
of
twelve
years
old
was
sitting
on
a
barrel
gnawing
a
corn
cob
when
i
made
known
my
business
the
woman
answered
no
not
i
i
got
no
chickens
to
sell
nor
eggs
neither
but
my
son
will
plenty
i
expect
here
nick
bawling
at
the
bottom
of
a
ladder
here
an
old
woman
what
wants
chickens
half
a
moment
brought
nick
to
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
i
found
my
merchant
was
one
of
a
ragged
crew
whom
i
had
been
used
to
observe
in
my
daily
walk
playing
marbles
in
the
dust
and
swearing
lustily
he
looked
about
ten
years
old
have
you
chicken
to
sell
my
boy
yes
and
eggs
too
more
nor
what
you
buy
having
enquired
price
condition
and
so
on
i
recollected
that
i
had
been
used
to
give
the
same
price
at
market
the
feathers
plucked
and
the
chicken
prepared
for
the
table
and
i
told
him
that
he
ought
not
to
charge
the
same
oh
for
that
i
expect
i
can
fix
as
well
as
ever
them
was
what
you
got
in
market
you
fix
them
yes
to
be
sure
why
not
i
thought
you
were
too
fond
of
marbles
he
gave
me
a
keen
glance
and
said
you
do
know
when
will
you
be
wanting
the
chickens
he
brought
them
at
the
time
directed
extremely
well
fixed
and
i
often
dealt
with
him
afterwards
when
i
paid
him
he
always
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breaches
pocket
which
i
presume
as
being
was
fortified
more
strongly
than
the
dilapidated
outworks
and
drew
from
thence
rather
more
dollars
levies
and
fips
than
his
dirty
little
hand
could
well
hold
my
curiosity
was
excited
and
though
i
felt
an
involuntary
disgust
towards
the
young
jew
i
repeatedly
conversed
with
him
you
are
very
rich
nick
i
said
to
him
one
day
on
his
making
an
ostentatious
display
of
change
as
he
called
it
he
sneered
with
a
most
unchildish
expression
of
countenance
and
replied
i
guess
be
a
bad
job
for
i
if
that
was
all
i
got
to
shew
i
asked
him
how
he
managed
his
business
he
told
me
that
he
bought
eggs
by
the
hundred
and
lean
chicken
by
the
score
from
the
waggons
that
passed
their
door
on
the
way
to
market
that
he
fatted
the
latter
in
coops
he
had
made
himself
and
could
easily
double
their
price
and
that
his
eggs
answered
well
too
when
he
sold
them
out
by
the
dozen
and
do
you
give
the
money
to
your
mother
i
expect
not
was
the
answer
with
another
sharp
glance
of
his
ugly
blue
eyes
what
do
you
do
with
it
nick
his
look
said
plainly
what
is
that
to
you
but
he
only
answered
quaintly
enough
i
takes
care
of
it
how
nick
got
his
first
dollar
is
very
doubtful
i
was
told
that
when
he
entered
the
village
store
the
person
serving
always
called
in
another
pair
of
eyes
but
having
obtained
it
the
spirit
activity
and
industry
with
which
he
caused
it
to
increase
and
multiply
would
have
been
delightful
in
one
of
miss
edgeworth
dear
little
clean
boys
who
would
have
carried
all
he
got
to
his
mother
but
in
nick
it
was
detestable
no
human
feeling
seemed
to
warm
his
young
heart
not
even
the
love
of
for
he
was
not
only
ragged
and
dirty
but
looked
considerably
more
than
half
starved
and
i
doubt
not
his
dinners
and
suppers
half
fed
his
fat
chickens
i
by
no
means
give
this
history
of
nick
the
chicken
merchant
as
an
anecdote
characteristic
in
all
respects
of
america
the
only
part
of
the
story
which
is
so
is
the
independence
of
the
little
man
and
is
one
instance
out
of
a
thousand
of
the
hard
dry
calculating
character
that
is
the
result
of
it
probably
nick
will
be
very
rich
perhaps
he
will
be
president
i
once
got
so
heartily
scolded
for
saying
that
i
did
not
think
all
american
citizens
were
equally
eligible
to
that
office
that
i
shall
never
again
venture
to
doubt
it
another
of
our
cottage
acquaintance
was
a
from
whom
we
frequently
bought
vegetables
from
the
wife
of
this
man
we
one
day
received
a
very
civil
invitation
to
please
to
come
and
pass
the
evening
with
them
in
prayer
the
novelty
of
the
circumstance
and
its
great
dissimilarity
to
the
ways
and
manners
of
our
own
country
induced
me
to
accept
the
invitation
and
also
to
record
the
visit
here
we
were
received
with
great
attention
and
a
place
was
assigned
us
on
one
of
the
benches
that
surrounded
the
little
parlour
several
persons
looking
like
mechanics
and
their
wives
were
present
every
one
sat
in
profound
silence
and
with
that
quiet
subdued
air
that
serious
people
assume
on
entering
a
church
at
length
a
long
black
man
entered
his
dress
the
cut
of
his
hair
and
his
whole
appearance
strongly
recalled
the
idea
of
one
of
cromwell
fanatics
he
stepped
solemnly
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
took
a
chair
that
stood
there
but
not
to
sit
upon
it
he
turned
the
back
towards
him
on
which
he
placed
his
hands
and
stoutly
uttering
a
sound
between
a
hem
and
a
cough
he
deposited
freely
on
either
side
of
him
a
considerable
portion
of
masticated
tobacco
he
then
began
to
preach
his
text
was
live
in
hope
and
he
continued
to
expound
it
for
two
hours
in
a
drawling
nasal
tone
with
no
other
respite
than
what
he
allowed
himself
for
expectoration
if
i
say
that
he
repeated
the
words
of
this
text
a
hundred
times
i
think
i
shall
not
exceed
the
truth
for
that
allows
more
than
a
minute
for
each
repetition
and
in
fact
the
whole
discourse
was
made
up
of
it
the
various
tones
in
which
he
uttered
it
might
have
served
as
a
lesson
on
emphasis
as
a
question
in
accents
of
triumph
in
accents
of
despair
of
pity
of
threatening
of
authority
of
doubt
of
hope
of
faith
having
exhausted
every
imaginable
variety
of
tone
he
abruptly
said
let
us
pray
and
twisting
his
chair
round
knelt
before
it
every
one
knelt
before
the
seat
they
had
occupied
and
listened
for
another
half
hour
to
a
rant
of
miserable
low
familiar
jargon
that
he
presumed
to
improvise
to
his
maker
as
a
prayer
in
this
however
the
cottage
apostle
only
followed
the
example
set
by
every
preacher
throughout
the
union
excepting
those
of
the
episcopalian
and
catholic
congregations
they
only
do
not
deem
themselves
privileged
to
address
the
deity
in
strains
of
crude
and
unweighed
importunity
these
ranters
may
sometimes
be
very
much
in
earnest
but
surely
the
least
we
can
say
of
it
is
that
they
praise
their
god
amiss
i
enquired
afterwards
of
a
friend
well
acquainted
with
such
matters
how
the
grim
preacher
of
hope
got
paid
for
his
labours
and
he
told
me
that
the
trade
was
an
excellent
one
for
that
many
a
gude
wife
bestowed
more
than
a
tithe
of
what
her
gude
man
trusted
to
her
keeping
in
rewarding
the
zeal
of
these
chosen
apostles
these
sable
ministers
walk
from
house
to
house
or
if
the
distance
be
considerable
ride
on
a
comfortable
ambling
nag
they
are
not
only
as
empty
as
wind
but
resemble
it
in
other
particulars
for
they
blow
where
they
list
and
no
man
knoweth
whence
they
come
nor
whither
they
go
when
they
see
a
house
that
promises
comfortable
lodging
and
entertainment
they
enter
there
and
say
to
the
good
woman
of
the
house
sister
shall
i
pray
with
you
if
the
answer
be
favourable
and
it
is
seldom
otherwise
he
instals
himself
and
his
horse
till
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
best
meat
drink
and
lodging
are
his
while
he
stays
and
he
seldom
departs
without
some
little
contribution
in
money
for
the
support
of
the
crucified
and
suffering
church
is
it
not
strange
that
the
most
intelligent
people
in
the
world
should
prefer
such
a
religion
as
this
to
a
form
established
by
the
wisdom
and
piety
of
the
ablest
and
best
among
the
erring
sons
of
men
solemnly
sanctioned
by
the
law
and
rendered
sacred
by
the
use
of
their
fathers
it
would
be
well
for
all
reasoners
on
the
social
system
to
observe
steadily
and
with
an
eye
obscured
by
no
beam
of
prejudice
the
result
of
the
experiment
that
is
making
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
if
i
mistake
not
they
might
learn
there
better
than
by
any
abstract
speculation
what
are
the
points
on
which
the
magistrates
of
a
great
people
should
dictate
to
them
and
on
what
points
they
should
be
left
freely
to
their
own
guidance
i
sincerely
believe
that
if
a
or
an
indian
brahmin
were
to
come
to
the
united
states
prepared
to
preach
and
pray
in
english
he
would
not
be
long
without
a
very
respectable
congregation
the
influence
of
a
religion
sanctioned
by
the
government
could
in
no
country
in
the
nineteenth
century
interfere
with
the
speculations
of
a
philosopher
in
his
closet
but
it
might
and
must
steady
the
weak
and
wavering
opinions
of
the
multitude
there
is
something
really
pitiable
in
the
effect
produced
by
the
want
of
this
rudder
oar
i
knew
a
family
where
one
was
a
methodist
one
a
presbyterian
and
a
third
a
baptist
and
another
where
one
was
a
quaker
one
a
declared
atheist
and
another
an
universalist
these
are
all
females
and
all
moving
in
the
best
society
that
america
affords
but
one
and
all
of
them
as
incapable
of
reasoning
on
things
past
present
and
to
come
as
the
infants
they
nourish
yet
one
and
all
of
them
perfectly
fit
to
move
steadily
and
usefully
in
a
path
marked
out
for
them
but
i
shall
be
called
an
itinerant
preacher
myself
if
i
pursue
this
theme
as
i
have
not
the
magic
power
of
my
admirable
friend
miss
mitford
to
give
grace
and
interest
to
the
humblest
rustic
details
i
must
not
venture
to
linger
among
the
cottages
that
surrounded
us
but
before
i
quit
them
i
must
record
the
pleasing
recollection
of
one
or
two
neighbours
of
more
companionable
rank
from
whom
i
received
so
much
friendly
attention
and
such
unfailing
kindness
in
all
my
little
domestic
embarrassments
that
i
shall
never
recall
the
memory
of
mohawk
without
paying
an
affectionate
tribute
to
these
far
distant
friends
i
wish
it
were
within
the
range
of
hope
that
i
might
see
them
again
in
my
own
country
and
repay
in
part
the
obligations
i
owe
them

visit
of
the
president
the
theatre
at
cincinnati
is
small
and
not
very
brilliant
in
decoration
but
in
the
absence
of
every
other
amusement
our
young
men
frequently
attended
it
and
in
the
bright
clear
nights
of
autumn
and
winter
the
mile
and
a
half
of
distance
was
not
enough
to
prevent
the
less
enterprising
members
of
the
family
from
sometimes
accompanying
them
the
great
inducement
to
this
was
the
excellent
acting
of
and
alexander
drake
the
managers
drake
was
an
englishman
nothing
could
be
more
distinct
than
their
line
of
acting
but
the
great
versatility
of
their
powers
enabled
them
often
to
appear
together
her
cast
was
the
highest
walk
of
tragedy
and
his
the
broadest
comedy
but
yet
as
goldsmith
says
of
his
sister
heroines
i
have
known
them
change
characters
for
a
whole
evening
together
and
have
wept
with
him
and
laughed
with
her
as
it
was
their
will
and
pleasure
to
ordain
i
think
in
his
comedy
he
was
superior
to
any
actor
i
ever
saw
in
the
same
parts
except
emery
alexander
comedy
was
like
that
of
the
french
who
never
appear
to
be
acting
at
all
he
was
himself
the
comic
being
the
author
aimed
at
depicting
let
him
speak
whose
words
he
would
from
shakspeare
to
colman
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
half
the
fun
was
his
own
he
had
too
in
a
very
high
degree
the
power
that
fawcett
possessed
of
drawing
tears
by
a
sudden
touch
of
natural
feeling
his
comic
songs
might
have
set
the
gravity
of
the
judges
and
bishops
together
at
defiance
liston
is
great
but
alexander
drake
was
greater
drake
formerly
miss
denny
greatly
resembles
miss
a
proof
of
this
is
that
kean
who
had
heard
of
the
resemblance
arrived
at
new
york
late
in
the
evening
and
having
repaired
to
the
theatre
saw
her
for
the
first
time
across
the
stage
and
immediately
exclaimed
that
miss
denny
her
voice
too
has
the
same
rich
and
touching
tones
and
is
superior
in
power
her
talent
is
decidedly
deep
and
genuine
feeling
correct
judgment
and
the
most
perfect
good
taste
distinguish
her
play
in
every
character
her
last
act
of
belvidera
is
superior
in
tragic
effect
to
any
thing
i
ever
saw
on
the
stage
the
one
great
exception
to
all
comparison
siddons
being
set
aside
it
was
painful
to
see
these
excellent
performers
playing
to
a
miserable
house
not
a
third
full
and
the
audience
probably
not
including
half
a
dozen
persons
who
would
prefer
their
playing
to
that
of
the
vilest
strollers
in
proof
of
this
i
saw
them
as
managers
give
place
to
paltry
actors
from
london
who
would
immediately
draw
crowded
houses
and
be
overwhelmed
with
applause
poor
drake
died
just
before
we
left
ohio
and
his
wife
who
besides
her
merit
as
an
actress
is
a
most
estimable
and
amiable
woman
is
left
with
a
large
family
i
have
little
or
rather
no
doubt
of
her
being
able
to
obtain
an
excellent
engagement
in
london
but
her
having
property
in
several
of
the
western
theatres
will
i
fear
detain
her
in
a
neighbourhood
where
she
is
neither
understood
nor
appreciated
she
told
me
many
very
excellent
professional
anecdotes
collected
during
her
residence
in
the
west
one
of
these
particularly
amused
me
as
a
specimen
of
western
idiom
a
lady
who
professed
a
great
admiration
for
drake
had
obtained
her
permission
to
be
present
upon
one
occasion
at
her
theatrical
toilet
she
was
dressing
for
some
character
in
which
she
was
to
stab
herself
and
her
dagger
was
lying
on
the
table
the
visitor
took
it
up
and
examining
it
with
much
emotion
exclaimed
what
do
you
really
jab
this
into
yourself
sevagarous
we
also
saw
the
great
american
star
forrest
what
he
may
become
i
will
not
pretend
to
prophesy
but
when
i
saw
him
play
hamlet
at
cincinnati
not
even
drake
sweet
ophelia
could
keep
me
beyond
the
third
act
it
is
true
that
i
have
seen
kemble
macready
kean
young
kemble
cook
and
talma
play
hamlet
and
i
might
not
perhaps
be
a
very
fair
judge
of
this
young
actor
merits
but
i
was
greatly
amused
when
a
gentleman
who
asked
my
opinion
of
him
told
me
upon
hearing
it
that
he
would
not
advise
me
to
state
it
freely
in
america
for
they
would
not
bear
it
the
theatre
was
really
not
a
bad
one
though
the
very
poor
receipts
rendered
it
impossible
to
keep
it
in
high
order
but
an
annoyance
infinitely
greater
than
decorations
indifferently
clean
was
the
style
and
manner
of
the
audience
men
came
into
the
lower
tier
of
boxes
without
their
coats
and
i
have
seen
shirt
sleeves
tucked
up
to
the
shoulder
the
spitting
was
incessant
and
the
mixed
smell
of
onions
and
whiskey
was
enough
to
make
one
feel
even
the
drakes
acting
dearly
bought
by
the
obligation
of
enduring
its
accompaniments
the
bearing
and
attitudes
of
the
men
are
perfectly
indescribable
the
heels
thrown
higher
than
the
head
the
entire
rear
of
the
person
presented
to
the
audience
the
whole
length
supported
on
the
benches
are
among
the
varieties
that
these
exquisite
exhibit
the
noises
too
were
perpetual
and
of
the
most
unpleasant
kind
the
applause
is
expressed
by
cries
and
thumping
with
the
feet
instead
of
clapping
and
when
a
patriotic
fit
seized
them
and
yankee
doodle
was
called
for
every
man
seemed
to
think
his
reputation
as
a
citizen
depended
on
the
noise
he
made
two
very
indifferent
figurantes
probably
from
the
ambigu
comique
or
la
gaiete
made
their
appearance
at
cincinnati
while
we
were
there
and
had
mercury
stepped
down
and
danced
a
upon
earth
his
godship
could
not
have
produced
a
more
violent
sensation
but
wonder
and
admiration
were
by
no
means
the
only
feelings
excited
horror
and
dismay
were
produced
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
no
one
i
believe
doubted
their
being
admirable
dancers
but
every
one
agreed
that
the
morals
of
the
western
world
would
never
recover
the
shock
when
i
was
asked
if
i
had
ever
seen
any
thing
so
dreadful
before
i
was
embarrassed
how
to
answer
for
the
young
women
had
been
exceedingly
careful
both
in
their
dress
and
in
their
dancing
to
meet
the
taste
of
the
people
but
had
it
been
virginie
in
her
most
transparent
attire
or
taglioni
in
her
most
remarkable
pirouette
they
could
not
have
been
more
reprobated
the
ladies
altogether
forsook
the
theatre
the
gentlemen
muttered
under
their
breath
and
turned
their
heads
aside
when
the
subject
was
mentioned
the
clergy
denounced
them
from
the
pulpit
and
if
they
were
named
at
the
meetings
of
the
saints
it
was
to
show
how
deep
the
horror
such
a
theme
could
produce
i
could
not
but
ask
myself
if
virtue
were
a
plant
thriving
under
one
form
in
one
country
and
flourishing
under
a
different
one
in
another
if
these
western
americans
are
right
then
how
dreadfully
wrong
are
we
it
is
really
a
very
puzzling
subject
but
this
was
not
the
only
point
on
which
i
found
my
notions
of
right
and
wrong
utterly
confounded
hardly
a
day
passed
in
which
i
did
not
discover
that
something
or
other
that
i
had
been
taught
to
consider
lawful
as
eating
was
held
in
abhorrence
by
those
around
me
many
words
to
which
i
had
never
heard
an
objectionable
meaning
attached
were
totally
interdicted
and
the
strangest
paraphrastic
sentences
substituted
i
confess
it
struck
me
that
notwithstanding
a
general
stiffness
of
manner
which
i
think
must
exceed
that
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
the
americans
have
imaginations
that
kindle
with
alarming
facility
i
could
give
many
anecdotes
to
prove
this
but
will
content
myself
with
a
few
a
young
german
gentleman
of
perfectly
good
manners
once
came
to
me
greatly
chagrined
at
having
offended
one
of
the
principal
families
in
the
neighbourhood
by
having
pronounced
the
word
before
the
ladies
of
it
an
old
female
friend
had
kindly
overcome
her
own
feelings
so
far
as
to
mention
to
him
the
cause
of
the
coolness
he
had
remarked
and
strongly
advised
his
making
an
apology
he
told
me
that
he
was
perfectly
well
disposed
to
do
so
but
felt
himself
greatly
at
a
loss
how
to
word
it
an
english
lady
who
had
long
kept
a
fashionable
in
one
of
the
atlantic
cities
told
me
that
one
of
her
earliest
cares
with
every
new
comer
was
the
endeavour
to
substitute
real
delicacy
for
this
affected
precision
of
manner
among
many
anecdotes
she
told
me
one
of
a
young
lady
about
fourteen
who
on
entering
the
receiving
room
where
she
only
expected
to
see
a
lady
who
had
enquired
for
her
and
finding
a
young
man
with
her
put
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
ran
out
of
the
room
again
screaming
a
man
a
man
a
man
on
another
occasion
one
of
the
young
ladies
in
going
up
stairs
to
the
unfortunately
met
a
boy
of
fourteen
coming
down
and
her
feelings
were
so
violently
agitated
that
she
stopped
panting
and
sobbing
nor
would
pass
on
till
the
boy
had
swung
himself
up
on
the
upper
banisters
to
leave
the
passage
free
at
cincinnati
there
is
a
garden
where
the
people
go
to
eat
ices
and
to
look
at
roses
for
the
preservation
of
the
flowers
there
is
placed
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
walks
a
sort
of
daub
representing
a
swiss
peasant
girl
holding
in
her
hand
a
scroll
requesting
that
the
roses
might
not
be
gathered
unhappily
for
the
artist
or
for
the
proprietor
or
for
both
the
petticoat
of
this
figure
was
so
short
as
to
shew
her
ancles
the
ladies
saw
and
shuddered
and
it
was
formally
intimated
to
the
proprietor
that
if
he
wished
for
the
patronage
of
the
ladies
of
cincinnati
he
must
have
the
petticoat
of
this
figure
lengthened
the
affrighted
purveyor
of
ices
sent
off
an
express
for
the
artist
and
his
paint
pot
he
came
but
unluckily
not
provided
with
any
colour
that
would
match
the
petticoat
the
necessity
however
was
too
urgent
for
delay
and
a
flounce
of
blue
was
added
to
the
petticoat
of
red
giving
bright
and
shining
evidence
before
all
men
of
the
immaculate
delicacy
of
the
cincinnati
ladies
i
confess
i
was
sometimes
tempted
to
suspect
that
this
ultra
refinement
was
not
very
deep
seated
it
often
appeared
to
me
like
the
consciousness
of
grossness
that
wanted
a
veil
but
the
veil
was
never
gracefully
adjusted
occasionally
indeed
the
very
same
persons
who
appeared
ready
to
faint
at
the
idea
of
a
statue
would
utter
some
unaccountable
sally
that
was
quite
startling
and
which
made
me
feel
that
the
indelicacy
of
which
we
were
accused
had
its
limits
the
following
anecdote
is
hardly
fit
to
tell
but
it
explains
what
i
mean
too
well
to
be
omitted
a
young
married
lady
of
and
most
fastidious
delicacy
who
had
been
brought
up
at
one
of
the
atlantic
seminaries
of
highest
reputation
told
me
that
her
house
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
a
populous
city
was
unfortunately
opposite
a
mansion
of
worse
than
doubtful
reputation
it
is
abominable
she
said
to
see
the
people
that
go
there
they
ought
to
be
exposed
i
and
another
lady
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
did
make
one
of
them
look
foolish
enough
last
summer
she
was
passing
the
day
with
me
and
while
we
were
sitting
at
the
window
we
saw
a
young
man
we
both
knew
ride
up
there
we
went
into
the
garden
and
watched
at
the
gate
for
him
to
come
back
and
when
he
did
we
both
stepped
out
and
i
said
to
him
are
you
not
ashamed
william
to
ride
by
my
house
and
back
again
in
that
manner
i
never
saw
a
man
look
so
foolish
in
conversing
with
ladies
on
the
customs
and
manners
of
europe
i
remarked
a
strong
propensity
to
consider
every
thing
as
wrong
to
which
they
were
not
accustomed
i
once
mentioned
to
a
young
lady
that
i
thought
a
picnic
party
would
be
very
agreeable
and
that
i
would
propose
it
to
some
of
our
friends
she
agreed
that
it
would
be
delightful
but
she
added
i
fear
you
will
not
succeed
we
are
not
used
to
such
sort
of
things
here
and
i
know
it
is
considered
very
indelicate
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
sit
down
together
on
the
grass
i
could
multiply
anecdotes
of
this
nature
but
i
think
these
sufficient
to
give
an
accurate
idea
of
the
tone
of
manners
in
this
particular
and
i
trust
to
justify
the
observations
i
have
made
one
of
the
spectacles
which
produced
the
greatest
astonishment
on
us
all
was
the
republican
simplicity
of
the
courts
of
justice
we
had
heard
that
the
judges
indulged
themselves
on
the
bench
in
those
extraordinary
attitudes
which
doubtless
some
peculiarity
of
the
american
formation
leads
them
to
find
the
most
comfortable
of
this
we
were
determined
to
judge
for
ourselves
and
accordingly
entered
the
court
when
it
was
in
full
business
with
three
judges
on
the
bench
the
annexed
sketch
will
better
describe
what
we
saw
than
any
thing
i
can
write
our
winter
passed
rapidly
away
and
pleasantly
enough
by
the
help
of
frosty
walks
a
little
skaiting
a
visit
to
lick
and
a
visit
to
the
shaking
quakers
a
good
deal
of
chess
and
a
good
deal
of
reading
notwithstanding
we
were
almost
in
the
back
woods
of
western
america
the
excursion
to
lick
in
kentucky
and
that
to
the
quaker
village
were
too
fatiguing
for
females
at
such
a
season
but
our
gentlemen
brought
us
home
mammoth
bones
and
shaking
quaker
stories
in
abundance
these
singular
people
the
shaking
quakers
of
america
give
undeniable
proof
that
communities
may
exist
and
prosper
for
they
have
continued
for
many
years
to
adhere
strictly
to
this
manner
of
life
and
have
been
constantly
increasing
in
wealth
they
have
formed
two
or
three
different
societies
in
distant
parts
of
the
union
all
governed
by
the
same
general
laws
and
all
uniformly
prosperous
and
flourishing
there
must
be
some
sound
and
wholesome
principle
at
work
in
these
establishments
to
cause
their
success
in
every
undertaking
and
this
principle
must
be
a
powerful
one
for
it
has
to
combat
much
that
is
absurd
and
much
that
is
mischievous
the
societies
are
generally
composed
of
about
an
equal
proportion
of
males
and
females
many
of
them
being
men
and
their
wives
but
they
are
all
bound
by
their
laws
not
to
cohabit
together
their
religious
observances
are
wholly
confined
to
singing
and
dancing
of
the
most
grotesque
kind
and
this
repeated
so
constantly
as
to
occupy
much
time
yet
these
people
become
rich
and
powerful
wherever
they
settle
themselves
whatever
they
manufacture
whatever
their
farms
produce
is
always
in
the
highest
repute
and
brings
the
highest
price
in
the
market
they
receive
all
strangers
with
great
courtesy
and
if
they
bring
an
introduction
they
are
lodged
and
fed
for
any
length
of
time
they
choose
to
stay
they
are
not
asked
to
join
in
their
labours
but
are
permitted
to
do
so
if
they
wish
it
the
lick
was
not
visited
and
even
partially
examined
without
considerable
fatigue
it
appeared
from
the
account
of
our
travellers
that
the
spot
which
gives
the
region
its
elegant
name
is
a
deep
bed
of
blue
clay
tenacious
and
unsound
so
much
so
as
to
render
it
both
difficult
and
dangerous
to
traverse
the
digging
it
has
been
found
so
laborious
that
no
one
has
yet
hazarded
the
expense
of
a
complete
search
into
its
depths
for
the
gigantic
relics
so
certainly
hidden
there
the
clay
has
never
been
moved
without
finding
some
of
them
and
i
think
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
money
and
perseverance
would
procure
a
more
perfect
specimen
of
an
entire
mammoth
than
we
have
yet
seen
since
the
above
was
written
an
immense
skeleton
nearly
perfect
has
been
extracted
and
now
the
time
arrived
that
our
domestic
circle
was
again
to
be
broken
up
our
eldest
son
was
to
be
entered
at
oxford
and
it
was
necessary
that
his
father
should
accompany
him
and
after
considerable
indecision
it
was
at
length
determined
that
i
and
my
daughters
should
remain
another
year
with
our
second
son
it
was
early
in
february
and
our
travellers
prepared
themselves
to
encounter
some
sharp
gales
upon
the
mountains
though
the
great
severity
of
the
cold
appeared
to
be
past
we
got
buffalo
robes
and
double
shoes
prepared
for
them
and
they
were
on
the
eve
of
departure
when
we
heard
that
general
jackson
the
president
was
expected
to
arrive
immediately
at
cincinnati
from
his
residence
in
the
west
and
to
proceed
by
steamboat
to
pittsburgh
on
his
way
to
washington
this
determined
them
not
to
fix
the
day
of
their
departure
till
they
heard
of
his
arrival
and
then
if
possible
to
start
in
the
same
boat
with
him
the
decent
dignity
of
a
private
conveyance
not
being
deemed
necessary
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
day
of
his
arrival
was
however
quite
uncertain
and
we
could
only
determine
to
have
every
thing
very
perfectly
in
readiness
let
it
come
when
it
would
this
resolution
was
hardly
acted
upon
when
the
news
reached
us
that
the
general
had
arrived
at
louisville
and
was
expected
at
cincinnati
in
a
few
hours
all
was
bustle
and
hurry
at
we
quickly
dispatched
our
packing
business
and
this
being
the
first
opportunity
we
had
had
of
witnessing
such
a
demonstration
of
popular
feeling
we
all
determined
to
be
present
at
the
debarkation
of
the
great
man
we
accordingly
walked
to
cincinnati
and
secured
a
favourable
station
at
the
both
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
first
magistrate
and
of
observing
his
reception
by
the
people
we
had
waited
but
a
few
moments
when
the
heavy
panting
of
the
steam
engines
and
then
a
discharge
of
cannon
told
that
we
were
just
in
time
another
moment
brought
his
vessel
in
sight
nothing
could
be
better
of
its
kind
than
his
approach
to
the
shore
the
noble
which
conveyed
him
was
flanked
on
each
side
by
one
of
nearly
equal
size
and
splendour
the
roofs
of
all
three
were
covered
by
a
crowd
of
men
cannon
saluted
them
from
the
shore
as
they
passed
by
to
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
the
town
there
they
turned
about
and
came
down
the
river
with
a
rapid
but
stately
motion
the
three
vessels
so
close
together
as
to
appear
one
mighty
mass
upon
the
water
when
they
arrived
opposite
the
principal
landing
they
swept
gracefully
round
and
the
side
vessels
separating
themselves
from
the
centre
fell
a
few
feet
back
permitting
her
to
approach
before
them
with
her
honoured
freight
all
this
manoeuvring
was
extremely
well
executed
and
really
beautiful
the
crowd
on
the
shore
awaited
her
arrival
in
perfect
stillness
when
she
touched
the
bank
the
people
on
board
gave
a
faint
huzza
but
it
was
answered
by
no
note
of
welcome
from
the
land
this
cold
silence
was
certainly
not
produced
by
any
want
of
friendly
feeling
towards
the
new
president
during
the
whole
of
the
canvassing
he
had
been
decidedly
the
popular
candidate
at
cincinnati
and
for
months
past
we
had
been
accustomed
to
the
cry
of
jackson
for
ever
from
an
overwhelming
majority
but
enthusiasm
is
not
either
the
virtue
or
the
vice
of
america
more
than
one
private
carriage
was
stationed
at
the
water
edge
to
await
the
general
orders
but
they
were
dismissed
with
the
information
that
he
would
walk
to
the
hotel
upon
receiving
this
intimation
the
silent
crowd
divided
itself
in
a
very
orderly
manner
leaving
a
space
for
him
to
walk
through
them
he
did
so
uncovered
though
the
distance
was
considerable
and
the
weather
very
cold
but
he
alone
with
the
exception
of
a
few
european
gentlemen
who
were
present
was
without
a
hat
he
wore
his
grey
hair
carelessly
but
not
ungracefully
arranged
and
spite
of
his
harsh
gaunt
features
he
looks
like
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
he
was
in
deep
mourning
having
very
recently
lost
his
wife
they
were
said
to
have
been
very
happy
together
and
i
was
pained
by
hearing
a
voice
near
me
exclaim
as
he
approached
the
spot
where
i
stood
there
goes
jackson
where
is
his
wife
another
sharp
voice
at
a
little
distance
cried
adams
for
ever
and
these
sounds
were
all
i
heard
to
break
the
silence
they
manage
these
matters
better
in
the
east
i
have
no
doubt
but
as
yet
i
was
still
in
the
west
and
still
inclined
to
think
that
however
meritorious
the
american
character
may
be
it
is
not
amiable
and
his
sons
joined
the
group
of
citizens
who
waited
upon
him
to
the
hotel
and
were
presented
to
the
president
in
form
that
is
they
shook
hands
with
him
learning
that
he
intended
to
remain
a
few
hours
there
or
more
properly
that
it
would
be
a
few
hours
before
the
would
be
ready
to
proceed
secured
berths
on
board
and
returned
to
take
a
hasty
dinner
with
us
at
the
hour
appointed
by
the
captain
and
his
son
accompanied
the
general
on
board
and
by
subsequent
letters
i
learnt
that
they
had
conversed
a
good
deal
with
him
and
were
pleased
by
his
conversation
and
manners
but
deeply
disgusted
by
the
brutal
familiarity
to
which
they
saw
him
exposed
at
every
place
on
their
progress
at
which
they
stopped
i
am
tempted
to
quote
one
passage
as
sufficiently
descriptive
of
the
manner
which
so
painfully
grated
against
their
european
feelings
was
not
a
hulking
boy
from
a
who
was
not
introduced
to
the
president
unless
indeed
as
was
the
case
with
some
they
introduced
themselves
for
instance
i
was
at
his
elbow
when
a
greasy
fellow
accosted
him
thus
general
jackson
i
guess
general
bowed
assent
why
they
told
me
you
was
dead
no
providence
has
hitherto
preserved
my
life
and
is
your
wife
alive
too
general
apparently
much
hurt
signified
the
contrary
upon
which
the
courtier
concluded
his
harangue
by
saying
aye
i
thought
it
was
the
one
or
the
of
ye
chapter
american
spring
controversy
between
owen
and
cambell
public
ball
separation
of
the
sexes
american
freedom
execution
the
american
spring
is
by
no
means
so
agreeable
as
the
american
autumn
both
move
with
faultering
step
and
slow
but
this
lingering
pace
which
is
delicious
in
autumn
is
most
tormenting
in
the
spring
in
the
one
case
you
are
about
to
part
with
a
friend
who
is
becoming
more
gentle
and
agreeable
at
every
step
and
such
steps
can
hardly
be
made
too
slowly
but
in
the
other
you
are
making
your
escape
from
a
dreary
cavern
where
you
have
been
shut
up
with
black
frost
and
biting
blasts
and
where
your
best
consolation
was
being
but
upon
second
thoughts
i
believe
it
would
be
more
correct
instead
of
complaining
of
the
slow
pace
of
the
american
spring
to
declare
that
they
have
no
spring
at
all
the
beautiful
autumn
often
lingers
on
till
christmas
after
which
winter
can
be
trifled
with
no
longer
and
generally
keeps
a
stubborn
hold
through
the
months
which
we
call
spring
when
he
suddenly
turns
his
back
and
summer
takes
his
place
the
inconceivable
uncertainty
of
the
climate
is
however
such
that
i
will
not
venture
to
state
about
what
time
this
change
takes
place
for
it
is
certain
that
let
me
name
what
time
i
would
it
would
be
easy
for
any
weather
journaliser
to
prove
me
wrong
by
quoting
that
the
thermometer
was
at
at
a
period
which
my
statement
included
in
the
winter
or
long
after
i
made
the
summer
commence
the
climate
of
england
is
called
uncertain
but
it
can
never
i
think
be
so
described
by
any
who
have
experienced
that
of
the
united
states
a
gentleman
on
whose
accuracy
i
could
depend
told
me
he
had
repeatedly
known
the
thermometer
vary
above
degrees
in
the
space
of
twelve
hours
this
most
unpleasant
caprice
of
the
temperature
is
i
conceive
one
cause
of
the
unhealthiness
of
the
climate
at
length
however
after
shivering
and
shaking
till
we
were
tired
of
it
and
having
been
half
ruined
in
which
by
the
way
is
nearly
as
dear
as
at
paris
and
dearer
in
many
parts
of
the
union
the
summer
burst
upon
us
full
blown
and
the
the
piazza
and
the
jalousies
were
again
in
full
requisition
it
was
in
the
early
summer
of
this
year
that
cincinnati
offered
a
spectacle
unprecedented
i
believe
in
any
age
or
country
owen
of
lanark
of
new
harmony
of
texas
well
known
to
the
world
by
all
or
either
of
these
additions
had
challenged
the
whole
religious
public
of
the
united
states
to
discuss
with
him
publicly
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
all
the
religions
that
had
ever
been
propagated
on
the
face
of
the
earth
stating
further
that
he
undertook
to
prove
that
they
were
all
equally
false
and
nearly
equally
mischievous
this
most
appalling
challenge
was
conveyed
to
the
world
through
the
medium
of
new
orleans
newspapers
and
for
some
time
it
remained
unanswered
at
length
the
reverend
alexander
campbell
from
bethany
not
of
judaea
but
of
kentucky
proclaimed
through
the
same
medium
that
he
was
ready
to
take
up
the
gauntlet
the
place
fixed
for
this
extraordinary
discussion
was
cincinnati
the
time
the
second
monday
in
may
being
about
a
year
from
the
time
the
challenge
was
accepted
thus
giving
the
disputants
time
to
prepare
themselves
owen
preparation
however
could
only
have
been
such
as
those
who
run
may
read
for
during
the
interval
he
traversed
great
part
of
north
america
crossed
the
atlantic
twice
visited
england
scotland
mexico
texas
and
i
know
not
how
many
places
besides
campbell
i
was
told
passed
this
period
very
differently
being
engaged
in
reading
with
great
research
and
perseverance
all
the
theological
works
within
his
reach
but
whatever
confidence
the
learning
and
piety
of
campbell
might
have
inspired
in
his
friends
or
in
the
cincinnati
christians
in
general
it
was
not
as
it
appeared
sufficient
to
induce
wilson
the
presbyterian
minister
of
the
largest
church
in
the
town
to
permit
the
display
of
them
within
its
walls
this
refusal
was
greatly
reprobated
and
much
regretted
as
the
curiosity
to
hear
the
discussion
was
very
general
and
no
other
edifice
offered
so
much
accommodation
a
methodist
large
enough
to
contain
a
thousand
persons
was
at
last
chosen
a
small
stage
was
arranged
round
the
pulpit
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
disputants
and
their
stenographers
the
pulpit
itself
was
throughout
the
whole
time
occupied
by
the
aged
father
of
campbell
whose
flowing
white
hair
and
venerable
countenance
constantly
expressive
of
the
deepest
attention
and
the
most
profound
interest
made
him
a
very
striking
figure
in
the
group
another
platform
was
raised
in
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
building
on
which
were
seated
seven
gentlemen
of
the
city
selected
as
moderators
the
chapel
was
equally
divided
one
half
being
appropriated
to
ladies
the
other
to
gentlemen
and
the
door
of
entrance
reserved
for
the
ladies
was
carefully
guarded
by
persons
appointed
to
prevent
any
crowding
or
difficulty
from
impeding
their
approach
i
suspect
that
the
ladies
were
indebted
to
owen
for
this
attention
the
arrangements
respecting
them
on
this
occasion
were
by
no
means
american
when
owen
rose
the
building
was
thronged
in
every
part
the
audience
or
congregation
i
hardly
know
which
to
call
them
were
of
the
highest
rank
of
citizens
and
as
large
a
proportion
of
best
bonnets
fluttered
there
as
the
two
horned
church
itself
could
boast
it
was
in
the
profoundest
silence
and
apparently
with
the
deepest
attention
that
owen
opening
address
was
received
and
surely
it
was
the
most
singular
one
that
ever
christian
men
and
women
sat
to
listen
to
when
i
recollect
its
object
and
the
uncompromising
manner
in
which
the
orator
stated
his
mature
conviction
that
the
whole
history
of
the
christian
mission
was
a
fraud
and
its
sacred
origin
a
fable
i
can
not
but
wonder
that
it
was
so
listened
to
yet
at
the
time
i
felt
no
such
wonder
never
did
any
one
practise
the
in
with
more
powerful
effect
than
owen
the
gentle
tone
of
his
voice
his
mild
sometimes
playful
but
never
ironical
manner
the
absence
of
every
vehement
or
harsh
expression
the
affectionate
interest
expressed
for
the
whole
human
family
the
air
of
candour
with
which
he
expressed
his
wish
to
be
convinced
he
was
wrong
if
he
indeed
were
so
his
kind
smile
the
mild
expression
of
his
eyes
in
short
his
whole
manner
disarmed
zeal
and
produced
a
degree
of
tolerance
that
those
who
did
not
hear
him
would
hardly
believe
possible
half
an
hour
was
the
time
allotted
for
each
haranguer
when
this
was
expired
the
moderators
were
seen
to
look
at
their
watches
owen
too
looked
at
his
without
pausing
smiled
shook
his
head
and
said
in
a
parenthesis
a
moment
patience
and
continued
for
nearly
another
half
hour
campbell
then
arose
his
person
voice
and
manner
all
greatly
in
his
favour
in
his
first
attack
he
used
the
arms
which
in
general
have
been
considered
as
belonging
to
the
other
side
of
the
question
he
quizzed
owen
most
unmercifully
pinched
him
here
for
his
parallelograms
hit
him
there
for
his
human
perfectibility
and
kept
the
whole
audience
in
a
roar
of
laughter
owen
joined
in
it
most
heartily
himself
and
listened
to
him
throughout
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
delighted
at
the
good
things
he
is
hearing
and
exactly
in
the
cue
to
enjoy
all
the
other
good
things
that
he
is
sure
will
follow
campbell
watch
was
the
only
one
which
reminded
us
that
we
had
listened
to
him
for
half
an
hour
and
having
continued
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
looked
at
it
he
sat
down
with
i
should
think
the
universal
admiration
of
his
auditory
owen
again
addressed
us
and
his
first
five
minutes
were
occupied
in
complimenting
campbell
with
all
the
strength
his
exceeding
hearty
laughter
had
left
him
but
then
he
changed
his
tone
and
said
the
business
was
too
serious
to
permit
the
next
half
hour
to
pass
so
lightly
and
so
pleasantly
as
the
last
and
then
he
read
us
what
he
called
his
twelve
fundamental
laws
of
human
nature
these
twelve
laws
he
has
taken
so
much
trouble
to
circulate
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
that
it
must
be
quite
unnecessary
to
repeat
them
here
to
me
they
appear
twelve
truisms
that
no
man
in
his
senses
would
ever
think
of
contradicting
but
how
any
one
can
have
conceived
that
the
explanation
and
defence
of
these
laws
could
furnish
forth
occupation
for
his
pen
and
his
voice
through
whole
years
of
unwearying
declamation
or
how
he
can
have
dreamed
that
they
could
be
twisted
into
a
refutation
of
the
christian
religion
is
a
mystery
which
i
never
expect
to
understand
from
this
time
owen
entrenched
himself
behind
his
twelve
laws
and
campbell
with
equal
gravity
confined
himself
to
bringing
forward
the
most
elaborate
theological
authorities
in
evidence
of
the
truth
of
revealed
religion
neither
appeared
to
me
to
answer
the
other
but
to
confine
themselves
to
the
utterance
of
what
they
had
uppermost
in
their
own
minds
when
the
discussion
began
i
lamented
this
on
the
side
of
campbell
as
i
am
persuaded
he
would
have
been
much
more
powerful
had
he
trusted
more
to
himself
and
less
to
his
books
owen
is
an
extraordinary
man
and
certainly
possessed
of
talent
but
he
appears
to
me
so
utterly
benighted
in
the
mists
of
his
own
theories
that
he
has
quite
lost
the
power
of
looking
through
them
so
as
to
get
a
peep
at
the
world
as
it
really
exists
around
him
at
the
conclusion
of
the
debate
which
lasted
for
fifteen
sittings
campbell
desired
the
whole
assembly
to
sit
down
they
obeyed
he
then
requested
all
who
wished
well
to
christianity
to
rise
and
a
very
large
majority
were
in
an
instant
on
their
legs
he
again
requested
them
to
be
seated
and
then
desired
those
who
believed
not
in
its
doctrines
to
rise
and
a
few
gentlemen
and
one
lady
obeyed
owen
protested
against
this
manoeuvre
as
he
called
it
and
refused
to
believe
that
it
afforded
any
proof
of
the
state
of
men
minds
or
of
either
declaring
that
not
only
was
such
a
result
to
be
expected
in
the
present
state
of
things
but
that
it
was
the
duty
of
every
man
who
had
children
to
feed
not
to
hazard
the
sale
of
his
hogs
or
his
iron
by
a
declaration
of
opinions
which
might
offend
the
majority
of
his
customers
it
was
said
that
at
the
end
of
the
fifteen
meetings
the
numerical
amount
of
the
christians
and
the
infidels
of
cincinnati
remained
exactly
what
it
was
when
they
began
this
was
a
result
that
might
have
been
perhaps
anticipated
but
what
was
much
less
to
have
been
expected
neither
of
the
disputants
ever
appeared
to
lose
their
temper
i
was
told
they
were
much
in
each
other
company
constantly
dining
together
and
on
all
occasions
expressed
most
cordially
their
mutual
esteem
all
this
i
think
could
only
have
happened
in
america
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
was
very
desirable
it
should
have
happened
any
where
in
noting
the
various
brilliant
events
which
diversified
our
residence
in
the
western
metropolis
i
have
omitted
to
mention
the
birthday
ball
as
it
is
called
a
festivity
which
i
believe
has
place
on
the
of
february
in
every
town
and
city
throughout
the
union
it
is
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
general
washington
and
well
deserves
to
be
marked
by
the
americans
as
a
day
of
jubilee
i
was
really
astonished
at
the
on
entering
for
i
saw
a
large
room
filled
with
extremely
company
among
whom
were
many
very
beautiful
girls
the
gentlemen
also
were
exceedingly
smart
but
i
had
not
yet
been
long
enough
in
western
america
not
to
feel
startled
at
recognising
in
almost
every
that
passed
me
the
master
or
shopman
that
i
had
been
used
to
see
behind
the
counter
or
lolling
at
the
door
of
every
shop
in
the
city
the
fairest
and
finest
belles
smiled
and
smirked
on
them
with
as
much
zeal
and
satisfaction
as
i
ever
saw
bestowed
on
an
eldest
son
and
i
therefore
could
feel
no
doubt
of
their
being
considered
as
of
the
highest
rank
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
there
is
no
distinction
of
classes
at
this
same
ball
i
was
looking
among
the
many
very
beautiful
girls
i
saw
there
for
one
more
beautiful
still
with
whose
lovely
face
i
had
been
particularly
struck
at
the
school
examination
i
have
mentioned
i
could
not
find
her
and
asked
a
gentleman
why
the
beautiful
miss
was
not
there
you
do
not
yet
understand
our
aristocracy
he
replied
the
family
of
miss
are
mechanics
but
the
young
lady
has
been
educated
at
the
same
school
as
these
whom
i
see
here
and
i
know
her
brother
has
a
shop
in
the
town
quite
as
large
and
apparently
as
prosperous
as
those
belonging
to
any
of
these
young
men
what
is
the
difference
he
is
a
mechanic
he
assists
in
making
the
articles
he
sells
the
others
call
themselves
merchants
the
dancing
was
not
quite
like
yet
not
very
unlike
what
we
see
at
an
assize
or
in
a
country
town
they
call
their
dances
cotillions
instead
of
quadrilles
and
the
figures
are
called
from
the
orchestra
in
english
which
has
very
ludicrous
effect
on
european
ears
the
arrangements
for
the
supper
were
very
singular
but
eminently
characteristic
of
the
country
the
gentlemen
had
a
splendid
entertainment
spread
for
them
in
another
large
room
of
the
hotel
while
the
poor
ladies
had
each
a
plate
put
into
their
hands
as
they
pensively
promenaded
the
ballroom
during
their
absence
and
shortly
afterwards
servants
appeared
bearing
trays
of
sweetmeats
cakes
and
creams
the
fair
creatures
then
sat
down
on
a
row
of
chairs
placed
round
the
walls
and
each
making
a
table
of
her
knees
began
eating
her
sweet
but
sad
and
sulky
repast
the
effect
was
extremely
comic
their
gala
dresses
and
the
decorated
room
forming
a
contrast
the
most
unaccountable
with
their
uncomfortable
and
forlorn
condition
this
arrangement
was
owing
neither
to
economy
nor
want
of
a
room
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
whole
party
but
purely
because
the
gentlemen
liked
it
better
this
was
the
answer
given
me
when
my
curiosity
tempted
me
to
ask
why
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
did
not
sup
together
and
this
was
the
answer
repeated
to
me
afterwards
by
a
variety
of
people
to
whom
i
put
the
same
question
i
am
led
to
mention
this
feature
of
american
manners
very
frequently
not
only
because
it
constantly
recurs
but
because
i
consider
it
as
being
in
a
great
degree
the
cause
of
that
universal
deficiency
in
good
manners
and
graceful
demeanour
both
in
men
and
women
which
is
so
remarkable
where
there
is
no
court
which
every
where
else
is
the
glass
wherein
the
higher
orders
dress
themselves
and
which
again
reflected
from
them
to
the
classes
below
goes
far
towards
polishing
in
some
degree
a
great
majority
of
the
population
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
manner
should
be
made
so
much
a
study
or
should
attain
an
equal
degree
of
elegance
but
the
deficiency
and
the
total
difference
is
greater
than
this
cause
alone
could
account
for
the
hours
of
enjoyment
are
important
to
human
beings
every
where
and
we
every
where
find
them
preparing
to
make
the
most
of
them
those
who
enjoy
themselves
only
in
society
whether
intellectual
or
convivial
prepare
themselves
for
it
and
such
make
but
a
poor
figure
when
forced
to
be
content
with
the
sweets
of
solitude
while
on
the
other
hand
those
to
whom
retirement
affords
the
greatest
pleasure
seldom
give
or
receive
much
in
society
wherever
the
highest
enjoyment
is
found
by
both
sexes
in
scenes
where
they
meet
each
other
both
will
prepare
themselves
to
appear
with
advantage
there
the
men
will
not
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
chewing
tobacco
or
even
of
spitting
and
the
women
will
contrive
to
be
capable
of
holding
a
higher
post
than
that
of
unwearied
in
america
with
the
exception
of
dancing
which
is
almost
wholly
confined
to
the
unmarried
of
both
sexes
all
the
enjoyments
of
the
men
are
found
in
the
absence
of
the
women
they
dine
they
play
cards
they
have
musical
meetings
they
have
suppers
all
in
large
parties
but
all
without
women
were
it
not
that
such
is
the
custom
it
is
impossible
but
that
they
would
have
ingenuity
enough
to
find
some
expedient
for
sparing
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
opulent
the
sordid
offices
of
household
drudgery
which
they
almost
all
perform
in
their
families
even
in
the
slave
states
though
they
may
not
and
iron
mix
puddings
and
cakes
one
half
of
the
day
and
watch
them
baking
the
other
half
still
the
very
highest
occupy
themselves
in
their
household
concerns
in
a
manner
that
precludes
the
possibility
of
their
becoming
elegant
and
enlightened
companions
in
baltimore
philadelphia
and
new
york
i
met
with
some
exceptions
to
this
but
speaking
of
the
country
generally
it
is
unquestionably
true
had
i
not
become
heartily
tired
of
my
prolonged
residence
in
a
place
i
cordially
disliked
and
which
moreover
i
began
to
fear
would
not
be
attended
with
the
favourable
results
we
had
anticipated
i
should
have
found
an
almost
inexhaustible
source
of
amusement
in
the
notions
and
opinions
of
the
people
i
conversed
with
and
as
it
was
i
often
did
enjoy
this
in
a
considerable
degree
we
received
as
i
have
mentioned
much
personal
kindness
but
this
by
no
means
interfered
with
the
national
feeling
of
i
believe
unconquerable
dislike
which
evidently
lives
at
the
bottom
of
every
truly
american
heart
against
the
english
this
shows
itself
in
a
thousand
little
ways
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
kind
and
friendly
intercourse
but
often
in
a
manner
more
comic
than
offensive
sometimes
it
was
well
now
i
think
your
government
must
just
be
fit
to
hang
themselves
for
that
last
war
they
cooked
up
it
has
been
the
ruin
of
you
i
expect
for
it
has
just
been
the
making
of
us
well
i
do
begin
to
understand
your
broken
english
better
than
i
did
but
no
wonder
i
could
not
make
it
out
very
well
at
first
as
you
come
from
london
for
every
body
knows
that
london
slang
is
the
most
dreadful
in
the
world
how
queer
it
is
now
that
all
the
people
that
live
in
london
should
put
the
where
it
is
not
and
never
will
put
it
where
it
is
i
was
egotistical
enough
to
ask
the
lady
who
said
this
if
she
found
that
i
did
so
no
you
do
not
was
the
reply
but
she
added
with
a
complacent
smile
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
the
pains
you
take
about
it
i
expect
you
have
heard
how
we
americans
laugh
at
you
all
for
it
and
so
you
are
trying
to
learn
our
way
of
pronouncing
one
lady
asked
me
very
gravely
if
we
had
left
home
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
vermin
with
which
the
english
of
all
ranks
were
afflicted
i
have
heard
from
unquestionable
authority
she
added
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
walk
through
the
streets
of
london
without
having
the
head
filled
i
laughed
a
little
but
spoke
not
a
word
she
coloured
highly
and
said
there
is
nothing
so
easy
as
to
laugh
but
truth
is
truth
laughed
at
or
not
i
must
preface
the
following
anecdote
by
observing
that
in
america
nearly
the
whole
of
the
insect
tribe
are
classed
under
the
general
name
of
bug
the
unfortunate
cosmopolite
known
by
that
name
amongst
us
is
almost
the
only
one
not
included
in
this
term
a
lady
abruptly
addressed
me
with
do
you
hate
chintzes
mrs
trollope
no
indeed
i
replied
i
think
them
very
pretty
there
now
if
that
is
not
being
english
i
reckon
you
call
that
loving
your
country
well
thank
god
we
americans
have
something
better
to
love
our
country
for
than
that
comes
to
we
are
not
obliged
to
say
that
we
like
nasty
filthy
chintzes
to
shew
that
we
are
good
patriots
chintzes
what
are
chintzes
possible
do
you
pretend
you
do
know
what
chintzes
are
why
the
nasty
little
stinking
that
all
the
beds
in
london
are
full
of
i
have
since
been
informed
that
is
spanish
for
bug
but
at
the
time
the
word
suggested
only
the
material
of
a
curtain
among
other
instances
of
that
species
of
modesty
so
often
seen
in
america
and
so
unknown
to
us
i
frequently
witnessed
one
which
while
it
evinced
the
delicacy
of
the
ladies
gave
opportunity
for
many
lively
sallies
from
the
gentlemen
i
saw
the
same
sort
of
thing
repeated
on
different
occasions
at
least
a
dozen
times
a
young
lady
is
employed
in
making
a
shirt
which
it
would
be
a
symptom
of
absolute
depravity
to
name
a
gentleman
enters
and
presently
begins
the
sprightly
dialogue
with
what
are
you
making
miss
clarissa
only
a
frock
for
my
sister
doll
sir
a
frock
not
possible
do
i
see
that
it
is
not
a
frock
come
miss
clarissa
what
is
it
tis
just
an
apron
for
one
of
our
negroes
mr
smith
how
can
you
miss
clarissa
why
is
not
the
two
side
joined
together
i
expect
you
were
better
tell
me
what
it
is
my
why
then
smith
it
is
just
a
now
that
passes
miss
clarissa
is
a
for
a
giant
then
shall
i
guess
miss
quit
smith
behave
yourself
or
i
certainly
be
affronted
before
the
conversation
arrives
at
this
point
both
gentleman
and
lady
are
in
convulsions
of
laughter
i
once
saw
a
young
lady
so
hard
driven
by
a
wit
that
to
prove
she
was
making
a
bag
and
nothing
but
a
bag
she
sewed
up
the
ends
before
his
eyes
shewing
it
triumphantly
and
exclaiming
there
now
what
can
you
say
to
that
one
of
my
friends
startled
me
one
day
by
saying
in
an
affectionate
but
rather
compassionate
tone
how
will
you
bear
to
go
back
to
england
to
live
and
to
bring
up
your
children
in
a
country
where
you
know
you
are
considered
as
no
better
than
the
dirt
in
the
streets
i
begged
she
would
explain
why
you
know
i
would
not
affront
you
for
any
thing
but
the
fact
is
we
americans
know
rather
more
than
you
think
for
and
certainly
if
i
was
in
england
i
should
not
think
of
associating
with
anything
but
lords
i
have
always
been
among
the
first
here
and
if
i
travelled
i
should
like
to
do
the
same
i
mean
i
sure
that
i
would
not
come
to
see
you
but
you
know
you
are
not
lords
and
therefore
i
know
very
well
how
you
are
treated
in
your
own
country
i
very
rarely
contradicted
statements
of
this
kind
as
i
found
it
less
trouble
and
infinitely
more
amusing
to
let
them
pass
indeed
had
i
done
otherwise
it
would
have
been
of
little
avail
as
among
the
many
conversations
i
held
in
america
respecting
my
own
country
i
do
not
recollect
a
single
instance
in
which
it
was
not
clear
that
i
knew
much
less
about
it
than
those
i
conversed
with
on
the
subject
of
national
glory
i
presume
i
got
more
than
my
share
of
buffeting
for
being
a
woman
there
was
no
objection
to
their
speaking
out
one
lady
indeed
who
was
a
great
patriot
evinced
much
delicacy
towards
me
for
upon
some
one
speaking
of
new
orleans
she
interrupted
them
saying
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
of
new
orleans
and
turning
to
me
added
with
great
gentleness
it
must
be
so
painful
to
your
feelings
to
hear
that
place
mentioned
the
immense
superiority
of
the
american
to
the
british
navy
was
a
constant
theme
and
to
this
i
always
listened
as
nearly
as
possible
in
silence
i
repeatedly
heard
it
stated
so
often
indeed
and
from
such
various
quarters
that
i
think
there
must
be
some
truth
in
it
that
the
american
sailors
fire
with
a
certainty
of
slaughter
whereas
our
shots
are
sent
very
nearly
at
random
this
said
a
naval
officer
of
high
reputation
is
the
blessed
effect
of
your
game
laws
your
sailors
never
fire
at
a
mark
whilst
our
free
tars
from
their
practice
in
pursuit
of
game
can
any
of
them
split
a
hair
but
the
favourite
the
constant
the
universal
sneer
that
met
me
every
where
was
on
our
attachments
to
things
obsolete
had
they
a
little
wit
among
them
i
am
certain
they
would
have
given
us
the
cognomen
of
my
grandmother
the
british
for
that
is
the
tone
they
take
and
it
is
thus
they
reconcile
themselves
to
the
crude
newness
of
every
thing
around
them
i
wonder
you
are
not
sick
of
kings
chancellors
and
archbishops
and
all
your
fustian
of
wigs
and
gowns
said
a
very
clever
gentleman
to
me
once
with
an
affected
yawn
i
protest
the
very
sound
almost
sets
me
to
sleep
it
is
amusing
to
observe
how
soothing
the
idea
seems
that
they
are
more
modern
more
advanced
than
england
our
classic
literature
our
princely
dignities
our
noble
institutions
are
all
relics
of
the
dark
ages
this
and
the
vastness
of
their
naked
territory
make
up
the
flattering
unction
which
is
laid
upon
the
soul
as
an
antidote
to
the
little
misgiving
which
from
time
to
time
arises
lest
their
large
country
be
not
of
quite
so
much
importance
among
the
nations
as
a
certain
paltry
little
place
that
they
wot
of
i
was
once
sitting
with
a
party
of
ladies
among
whom
were
one
or
two
young
girls
whose
curiosity
was
greater
than
their
patriotism
and
they
asked
me
many
questions
respecting
the
splendour
and
extent
of
london
i
was
endeavouring
to
satisfy
them
by
the
best
description
i
could
give
when
we
were
interrupted
by
another
lady
who
exclaimed
do
hold
your
tongues
girls
about
london
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
beautiful
city
is
look
at
philadelphia
when
trollope
has
been
there
i
think
she
will
allow
that
it
is
better
worth
talking
about
than
that
great
overgrown
collection
of
nasty
filthy
dirty
streets
that
they
call
london
once
in
ohio
and
once
in
the
district
of
columbia
i
had
an
atlas
displayed
before
me
that
i
might
be
convinced
by
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
what
a
very
contemptible
little
country
i
came
from
i
shall
never
forget
the
gravity
with
which
on
the
latter
occasion
a
gentleman
drew
out
his
graduated
and
shewed
me
past
contradiction
that
the
whole
of
the
british
dominions
did
not
equal
in
size
one
of
their
least
important
states
nor
the
air
with
which
after
the
demonstration
he
placed
his
feet
upon
the
considerably
higher
than
his
head
and
whistled
yankee
doodle
their
glorious
institutions
their
unequalled
freedom
were
of
course
not
left
unsung
i
took
some
pains
to
ascertain
what
they
meant
by
their
glorious
institutions
and
it
is
with
no
affectation
of
ignorance
that
i
profess
i
never
could
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
which
is
however
on
the
lip
of
every
american
when
he
talks
of
his
country
i
asked
if
by
their
institutions
they
meant
their
hospitals
and
penitentiaries
oh
no
we
mean
the
glorious
institutions
which
are
coeval
with
the
revolution
is
it
i
asked
your
institution
of
marriage
which
you
have
made
purely
a
civil
and
not
a
religious
rite
to
be
performed
by
a
justice
of
peace
instead
of
a
clergyman
oh
no
we
speak
of
our
divine
political
institutions
yet
still
i
was
in
the
dark
nor
can
i
guess
what
they
mean
unless
they
call
incessant
electioneering
without
pause
or
interval
for
a
single
day
for
a
single
hour
of
their
whole
existence
a
glorious
institution
their
unequalled
freedom
i
think
i
understand
better
their
code
of
common
law
is
built
upon
ours
and
the
difference
between
us
is
this
in
england
the
laws
are
acted
upon
in
america
they
are
not
i
do
not
speak
of
the
police
of
the
atlantic
cities
i
believe
it
is
well
arranged
in
new
york
it
is
celebrated
for
being
so
but
out
of
the
range
of
their
influence
the
contempt
of
law
is
greater
than
i
can
venture
to
state
with
any
hope
of
being
believed
trespass
assault
robbery
nay
even
murder
are
often
committed
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
legal
interference
during
the
summer
that
we
passed
most
delightfully
in
maryland
our
rambles
were
often
restrained
in
various
directions
by
the
advice
of
our
kind
friends
who
knew
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
country
when
we
asked
the
cause
we
were
told
there
is
a
on
that
road
and
it
will
not
be
safe
to
pass
it
the
line
of
the
chesapeak
and
ohio
canal
passed
within
a
few
miles
of
s
residence
it
twice
happened
during
our
stay
with
her
that
dead
bodies
were
found
partially
concealed
near
it
the
circumstance
was
related
as
a
sort
of
half
wonder
and
when
i
asked
particulars
of
those
who
on
one
occasion
brought
the
tale
the
reply
was
oh
he
was
murdered
i
expect
or
maybe
he
died
of
the
canal
fever
but
they
say
he
had
marks
of
being
throttled
no
inquest
was
summoned
and
certainly
no
more
sensation
was
produced
by
the
occurrence
than
if
a
sheep
had
been
found
in
the
same
predicament
the
abundance
of
food
and
the
scarcity
of
hanging
were
also
favourite
topics
as
proving
their
superiority
to
england
they
are
both
excellent
things
but
i
do
not
admit
the
inference
a
wide
and
most
fertile
territory
as
yet
but
thinly
inhabited
may
easily
be
made
to
yield
abundant
food
for
its
population
and
where
a
desperate
villain
knows
that
when
he
has
made
his
town
or
his
village
too
hot
to
hold
him
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
travel
a
few
miles
west
and
be
sure
of
finding
plenty
of
beef
and
whiskey
with
no
danger
that
the
law
shall
follow
him
it
is
not
extraordinary
that
executions
should
be
rare
once
during
our
residence
at
cincinnati
a
murderer
of
uncommon
atrocity
was
taken
tried
convicted
and
condemned
to
death
it
had
been
shewn
on
his
trial
that
some
years
before
he
had
murdered
a
wife
and
child
at
new
orleans
but
little
notice
had
been
taken
of
it
at
the
time
the
crime
which
had
now
thrown
him
into
the
hands
of
justice
was
the
recent
murder
of
a
second
wife
and
the
chief
evidence
against
him
was
his
own
son
the
day
of
his
execution
was
fixed
and
the
sensation
produced
was
so
great
from
the
strangeness
of
the
occurrence
no
white
man
having
ever
been
executed
at
cincinnati
that
persons
from
sixty
miles
distance
came
to
be
present
at
it
meanwhile
some
unco
good
people
began
to
start
doubts
as
to
the
righteousness
of
hanging
a
man
and
made
application
to
the
governor
of
the
of
ohio
to
commute
the
sentence
into
imprisonment
the
governor
for
some
time
refused
to
interfere
with
the
sentence
of
the
tribunal
before
which
he
had
been
tried
but
at
length
frightened
at
the
unusual
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
he
yielded
to
the
importunity
of
the
presbyterian
party
who
had
assailed
him
and
sent
off
an
order
to
the
sheriff
accordingly
but
this
order
was
not
to
reprieve
him
but
to
ask
him
if
he
pleased
to
be
reprieved
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
instead
of
being
hanged
the
governors
of
states
have
the
same
power
over
life
and
death
as
is
vested
with
us
in
the
crown
the
sheriff
waited
upon
the
criminal
and
made
his
proposal
and
was
answered
if
any
thing
could
make
me
agree
to
it
it
would
be
the
hope
of
living
long
enough
to
kill
you
and
my
dog
of
a
son
however
i
wo
agree
you
shall
have
the
hanging
of
me
the
worthy
sheriff
to
whom
the
ghastly
office
of
executioner
is
assigned
said
all
in
his
power
to
persuade
him
to
sign
the
offered
document
but
in
vain
he
obtained
nothing
but
abuse
for
his
efforts
the
day
of
execution
arrived
the
place
appointed
was
the
side
of
a
hill
the
only
one
cleared
of
trees
near
the
town
and
many
hours
before
the
time
fixed
we
saw
it
entirely
covered
by
an
immense
multitude
of
men
women
and
children
at
length
the
hour
arrived
the
dismal
cart
was
seen
slowly
mounting
the
hill
the
noisy
throng
was
hushed
into
solemn
silence
the
wretched
criminal
mounted
the
scaffold
when
again
the
sheriff
asked
him
to
sign
his
acceptance
of
the
commutation
proposed
but
he
spurned
the
paper
from
him
and
cried
aloud
hang
me
midday
was
the
moment
appointed
for
cutting
the
rope
the
sheriff
stood
his
watch
in
one
hand
and
a
knife
in
the
other
the
hand
was
lifted
to
strike
when
the
criminal
stoutly
exclaimed
i
sign
and
he
was
conveyed
back
to
prison
amidst
the
shouts
laughter
and
ribaldry
of
the
mob
i
am
not
fond
of
hanging
but
there
was
something
in
all
this
that
did
not
look
like
the
decent
dignity
of
wholesome
justice
chapter
it
was
in
the
course
of
this
summer
that
i
found
the
opportunity
i
had
long
wished
for
of
attending
a
and
i
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
of
an
english
lady
and
gentleman
to
accompany
them
in
their
carriage
to
the
spot
where
it
is
held
this
was
in
a
wild
district
on
the
confines
of
indiana
the
prospect
of
passing
a
night
in
the
back
woods
of
indiana
was
by
no
means
agreeable
but
i
screwed
my
courage
to
the
proper
pitch
and
set
forth
determined
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
hear
with
my
own
ears
what
a
really
was
i
had
heard
it
said
that
being
at
a
was
like
standing
at
the
gate
of
heaven
and
seeing
it
opening
before
you
i
had
heard
it
said
that
being
at
a
was
like
finding
yourself
within
the
gates
of
hell
in
either
case
there
must
be
something
to
gratify
curiosity
and
compensate
one
for
the
fatigue
of
a
long
rumbling
ride
and
a
sleepless
night
we
reached
the
ground
about
an
hour
before
midnight
and
the
approach
to
it
was
highly
picturesque
the
spot
chosen
was
the
verge
of
an
unbroken
forest
where
a
space
of
about
twenty
acres
appeared
to
have
been
partially
cleared
for
the
purpose
tents
of
different
sizes
were
pitched
very
near
together
in
a
circle
round
the
cleared
space
behind
them
were
ranged
an
exterior
circle
of
carriages
of
every
description
and
at
the
back
of
each
were
fastened
the
horses
which
had
drawn
them
thither
through
this
triple
circle
of
defence
we
distinguished
numerous
fires
burning
brightly
within
it
and
still
more
numerous
lights
flickering
from
the
trees
that
were
left
in
the
enclosure
the
moon
was
in
meridian
splendour
above
our
heads
we
left
the
carriage
to
the
care
of
a
servant
who
was
to
prepare
a
bed
in
it
for
and
me
and
entered
the
inner
circle
the
first
glance
reminded
me
of
vauxhall
from
the
effect
of
the
lights
among
the
trees
and
the
moving
crowd
below
them
but
the
second
shewed
a
scene
totally
unlike
any
thing
i
had
ever
witnessed
four
high
frames
constructed
in
the
form
of
altars
were
placed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
enclosure
on
these
were
supported
layers
of
earth
and
sod
on
which
burned
immense
fires
of
blazing
pinewood
on
one
side
a
rude
platform
was
erected
to
accommodate
the
preachers
fifteen
of
whom
attended
this
meeting
and
with
very
short
intervals
for
necessary
refreshment
and
private
devotion
preached
in
rotation
day
and
night
from
tuesday
to
saturday
when
we
arrived
the
preachers
were
silent
but
we
heard
issuing
from
nearly
every
tent
mingled
sounds
of
praying
preaching
singing
and
lamentation
the
curtains
in
front
of
each
tent
were
dropped
and
the
faint
light
that
gleamed
through
the
white
drapery
backed
as
it
was
by
the
dark
forest
had
a
beautiful
and
mysterious
effect
that
set
the
imagination
at
work
and
had
the
sounds
which
vibrated
around
us
been
less
discordant
harsh
and
unnatural
i
should
have
enjoyed
it
but
listening
at
the
corner
of
a
tent
which
poured
forth
more
than
its
proportion
of
clamour
in
a
few
moments
chased
every
feeling
derived
from
imagination
and
furnished
realities
that
could
neither
be
mistaken
or
forgotten
great
numbers
of
persons
were
walking
about
the
ground
who
appeared
like
ourselves
to
be
present
only
as
spectators
some
of
these
very
unceremoniously
contrived
to
raise
the
drapery
of
this
tent
at
one
comer
so
as
to
afford
us
a
perfect
view
of
the
interior
the
floor
was
covered
with
straw
which
round
the
sides
was
heaped
in
masses
that
might
serve
as
seats
but
which
at
that
moment
were
used
to
support
the
heads
and
the
arms
of
the
circle
of
men
and
women
who
kneeled
on
the
floor
out
of
about
thirty
persons
thus
placed
perhaps
half
a
dozen
were
men
one
of
these
a
handsome
looking
youth
of
eighteen
or
twenty
kneeled
just
below
the
opening
through
which
i
looked
his
arm
was
encircling
the
neck
of
a
young
girl
who
knelt
beside
him
with
her
hair
hanging
dishevelled
upon
her
shoulders
and
her
features
working
with
the
most
violent
agitation
soon
after
they
both
fell
forward
on
the
straw
as
if
unable
to
endure
in
any
other
attitude
the
burning
eloquence
of
a
tall
grim
figure
in
black
who
standing
erect
in
the
centre
was
uttering
with
incredible
vehemence
an
oration
that
seemed
to
hover
between
praying
and
preaching
his
arms
hung
stiff
and
immoveable
by
his
side
and
he
looked
like
an
machine
set
in
action
by
a
movement
so
violent
as
to
threaten
its
own
destruction
so
jerkingly
painfully
yet
rapidly
did
his
words
tumble
out
the
kneeling
circle
ceasing
not
to
call
in
every
variety
of
tone
on
the
name
of
jesus
accompanied
with
sobs
groans
and
a
sort
of
low
howling
inexpressibly
painful
to
listen
to
but
my
attention
was
speedily
withdrawn
from
the
preacher
and
the
circle
round
him
by
a
figure
which
knelt
alone
at
some
distance
it
was
a
living
image
of
macbriar
as
young
as
wild
and
as
terrible
his
thin
arms
tossed
above
his
head
had
forced
themselves
so
far
out
of
the
sleeves
that
they
were
bare
to
the
elbow
his
large
eyes
glared
frightfully
and
he
continued
to
scream
without
an
intermission
the
word
glory
with
a
violence
that
seemed
to
swell
every
vein
to
bursting
it
was
too
dreadful
to
look
upon
long
and
we
turned
away
shuddering
we
made
the
circuit
of
the
tents
pausing
where
attention
was
particularly
excited
by
sounds
more
vehement
than
ordinary
we
contrived
to
look
into
many
all
were
strewed
with
straw
and
the
distorted
figures
that
we
saw
kneeling
sitting
and
lying
amongst
it
joined
to
the
woeful
and
convulsive
cries
gave
to
each
the
air
of
a
cell
in
bedlam
one
tent
was
occupied
exclusively
by
negroes
they
were
all
and
looked
exactly
as
if
they
were
performing
a
scene
on
the
stage
one
woman
wore
a
dress
of
pink
gauze
trimmed
with
silver
lace
another
was
dressed
in
pale
yellow
silk
one
or
two
had
splendid
turbans
and
all
wore
a
profusion
of
ornaments
the
men
were
in
snow
white
pantaloons
with
gay
coloured
linen
jackets
one
of
these
a
youth
of
comeliness
was
preaching
with
the
most
violent
gesticulations
frequently
springing
high
from
the
ground
and
clapping
his
hands
over
his
head
could
our
missionary
societies
have
heard
the
trash
he
uttered
by
way
of
an
address
to
the
deity
they
might
perhaps
have
doubted
whether
his
conversion
had
much
enlightened
his
mind
at
midnight
a
horn
sounded
through
the
camp
which
we
were
told
was
to
call
the
people
from
private
to
public
worship
and
we
presently
saw
them
flocking
from
all
sides
to
the
front
of
the
preachers
stand
and
i
contrived
to
place
ourselves
with
our
backs
supported
against
the
lower
part
of
this
structure
and
we
were
thus
enabled
to
witness
the
scene
which
followed
without
personal
danger
there
were
about
two
thousand
persons
assembled
one
of
the
preachers
began
in
a
low
nasal
tone
and
like
all
other
methodist
preachers
assured
us
of
the
enormous
depravity
of
man
as
he
comes
from
the
hands
of
his
maker
and
of
his
perfect
sanctification
after
he
had
wrestled
sufficiently
with
the
lord
to
get
hold
of
him
the
admiration
of
the
crowd
was
evinced
by
almost
constant
cries
of
amen
amen
jesus
jesus
glory
glory
and
the
like
but
this
comparative
tranquility
did
not
last
long
the
preacher
told
them
that
this
night
was
the
time
fixed
upon
for
anxious
sinners
to
wrestle
with
the
lord
that
he
and
his
brethren
were
at
hand
to
help
them
and
that
such
as
needed
their
help
were
to
come
forward
into
the
pen
the
phrase
forcibly
recalled
milton
lines
blind
mouths
that
scarce
themselves
know
how
to
hold
a
or
have
learned
aught
else
the
least
that
to
the
faithful
herdsman
art
belongs
but
when
they
list
their
lean
and
flashy
songs
grate
on
their
scrannel
pipes
of
wretched
straw
the
hungry
sheep
look
up
and
are
not
fed
but
swoln
with
wind
and
the
rank
mist
they
draw
rot
inwardly
and
foul
contagion
spread
the
pen
was
the
space
immediately
below
the
preachers
stand
we
were
therefore
placed
on
the
edge
of
it
and
were
enabled
to
see
and
hear
all
that
took
place
in
the
very
centre
of
this
extraordinary
exhibition
the
crowd
fell
back
at
the
mention
of
the
and
for
some
minutes
there
was
a
vacant
space
before
us
the
preachers
came
down
from
their
stand
and
placed
themselves
in
the
midst
of
it
beginning
to
sing
a
hymn
calling
upon
the
penitents
to
come
forth
as
they
sung
they
kept
turning
themselves
round
to
every
part
of
the
crowd
and
by
degrees
the
voices
of
the
whole
multitude
joined
in
chorus
this
was
the
only
moment
at
which
i
perceived
any
thing
like
the
solemn
and
beautiful
effect
which
i
had
heard
ascribed
to
this
woodland
worship
it
is
certain
that
the
combined
voices
of
such
a
multitude
heard
at
dead
of
night
from
the
depths
of
their
eternal
forests
the
many
fair
young
faces
turned
upward
and
looking
paler
and
lovelier
as
they
met
the
the
dark
figures
of
the
officials
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
the
lurid
glare
thrown
by
the
on
the
woods
beyond
did
altogether
produce
a
fine
and
solemn
effect
that
i
shall
not
easily
forget
but
ere
i
had
well
enjoyed
it
the
scene
changed
and
sublimity
gave
place
to
horror
and
disgust
the
exhortation
nearly
resembled
that
which
i
had
heard
at
the
revival
but
the
result
was
very
different
for
instead
of
the
few
hysterical
women
who
had
distinguished
themselves
on
that
occasion
above
a
hundred
persons
nearly
all
females
came
forward
uttering
howlings
and
groans
so
terrible
that
i
shall
never
cease
to
shudder
when
i
recall
them
they
appeared
to
drag
each
other
forward
and
on
the
word
being
given
let
us
pray
they
all
fell
on
their
knees
but
this
posture
was
soon
changed
for
others
that
permitted
greater
scope
for
the
convulsive
movements
of
their
limbs
and
they
were
soon
all
lying
on
the
ground
in
an
indescribable
confusion
of
heads
and
legs
they
threw
about
their
limbs
with
such
incessant
and
violent
motions
that
i
was
every
instant
expecting
some
serious
accident
to
occur
but
how
am
i
to
describe
the
sounds
that
proceeded
from
this
strange
mass
of
human
beings
i
know
no
words
which
can
convey
an
idea
of
it
hysterical
sobbings
convulsive
groans
shrieks
and
screams
the
most
appalling
burst
forth
on
all
sides
i
felt
sick
with
horror
as
if
their
hoarse
and
over
strained
voices
failed
to
make
noise
enough
they
soon
began
to
clap
their
hands
violently
the
scene
described
by
dante
was
before
me
quivi
sospiri
pianti
ed
alti
guai
risonavon
per
orribili
favelle
parole
di
dolore
accenti
voci
alti
e
floche
e
suon
di
man
con
elle
many
of
these
wretched
creatures
were
beautiful
young
females
the
preachers
moved
about
among
them
at
once
exciting
and
soothing
their
agonies
i
heard
the
muttered
sister
dear
sister
i
saw
the
insidious
lips
approach
the
cheeks
of
the
unhappy
girls
i
heard
the
murmured
confessions
of
the
poor
victims
and
i
watched
their
tormentors
breathing
into
their
ears
consolations
that
tinged
the
pale
cheek
with
red
had
i
been
a
man
i
am
sure
i
should
have
been
guilty
of
some
rash
act
of
interference
nor
do
i
believe
that
such
a
scene
could
have
been
acted
in
the
presence
of
englishmen
without
instant
punishment
being
inflicted
not
to
mention
the
salutary
discipline
of
the
treadmill
which
beyond
all
question
would
in
england
have
been
applied
to
check
so
turbulent
and
so
vicious
a
scene
after
the
first
wild
burst
that
followed
their
prostration
the
meanings
in
many
instances
became
loudly
articulate
and
i
then
experienced
a
strange
vibration
between
tragic
and
comic
feeling
a
very
pretty
girl
who
was
kneeling
in
the
attitude
of
magdalene
immediately
before
us
amongst
an
immense
quantity
of
jargon
broke
out
thus
woe
woe
to
the
backsliders
hear
it
hear
it
jesus
when
i
was
fifteen
my
mother
died
and
i
backslided
oh
jesus
i
backslided
take
me
home
to
my
mother
jesus
take
me
home
to
her
for
i
am
weary
oh
john
mitchel
john
mitchel
and
after
sobbing
piteously
behind
her
raised
hands
she
lifted
her
sweet
face
again
which
was
as
pale
as
death
and
said
shall
i
sit
on
the
sunny
bank
of
salvation
with
my
mother
my
own
dear
mother
oh
jesus
take
me
home
take
me
home
who
could
refuse
a
tear
to
this
earnest
wish
for
death
in
one
so
young
and
so
lovely
but
i
saw
her
ere
i
left
the
ground
with
her
hand
fast
locked
and
her
head
supported
by
a
man
who
looked
very
much
as
don
juan
might
when
sent
back
to
earth
as
too
bad
for
the
regions
below
one
woman
near
us
continued
to
call
on
the
lord
as
it
is
termed
in
the
loudest
possible
tone
and
without
a
interval
for
the
two
hours
that
we
kept
our
dreadful
station
she
became
frightfully
hoarse
and
her
face
so
red
as
to
make
me
expect
she
would
burst
a
among
the
rest
of
her
rant
she
said
i
will
hold
fast
to
jesus
i
never
will
let
him
go
if
they
take
me
to
hell
i
will
still
hold
him
fast
fast
fast
the
stunning
noise
was
sometimes
varied
by
the
preachers
beginning
to
sing
but
the
convulsive
movements
of
the
poor
maniacs
only
became
more
violent
at
length
the
atrocious
wickedness
of
this
horrible
scene
increased
to
a
degree
of
grossness
that
drove
us
from
our
station
we
returned
to
the
carriage
at
about
three
in
the
morning
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
listening
to
the
ever
increasing
tumult
at
the
pen
to
sleep
was
impossible
at
daybreak
the
horn
again
sounded
to
send
them
to
private
devotion
and
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
i
saw
the
whole
camp
as
joyously
and
eagerly
employed
in
preparing
and
devouring
their
most
substantial
breakfasts
as
if
the
night
had
been
passed
in
dancing
and
i
marked
many
a
fair
but
pale
face
that
i
recognised
as
a
demoniac
of
the
night
simpering
beside
a
swain
to
whom
she
carefully
administered
hot
coffee
and
eggs
the
preaching
saint
and
the
howling
sinner
seemed
alike
to
relish
this
mode
of
recruiting
their
strength
after
enjoying
abundance
of
strong
tea
which
proved
a
delightful
restorative
after
a
night
so
strangely
spent
i
wandered
alone
into
the
forest
and
i
never
remember
to
have
found
perfect
quiet
more
delightful
we
soon
after
left
the
ground
but
before
our
departure
we
learnt
that
a
very
collection
had
been
made
by
the
preachers
for
bibles
tracts
and
other
religious
chapter
danger
of
rural
excursions
sickness
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
american
scenery
in
the
west
even
when
you
are
in
a
neighbourhood
that
affords
much
to
admire
at
least
in
doing
so
you
run
considerable
risk
of
injuring
your
health
nothing
is
considered
more
dangerous
than
exposure
to
midday
heat
except
exposure
to
evening
damp
and
the
twilight
is
so
short
that
if
you
set
out
on
an
expedition
when
the
fervid
heat
subsides
you
can
hardly
get
half
a
mile
before
sun
down
as
they
call
it
warns
you
that
you
must
run
or
drive
home
again
as
fast
as
possible
for
fear
you
should
get
a
chill
i
believe
we
braved
all
this
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
whole
country
and
if
we
had
not
we
should
have
left
cincinnati
without
seeing
any
thing
of
the
country
around
it
though
we
kept
steadily
to
our
resolution
of
passing
no
more
sylvan
hours
in
the
forests
of
ohio
we
often
spent
entire
days
in
kentucky
tracing
the
course
of
a
creek
or
climbing
the
highest
points
within
our
reach
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
some
distant
object
a
beautiful
reach
of
the
ohio
or
the
dark
windings
of
the
pretty
licking
were
indeed
always
the
most
remarkable
features
in
the
landscape
there
was
one
spot
however
so
beautiful
that
we
visited
it
again
and
again
it
was
by
no
means
free
from
mosquitoes
and
being
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
with
many
enormous
trees
lying
on
the
ground
around
it
was
just
such
a
place
as
we
had
been
told
a
hundred
times
was
particularly
dangerous
nevertheless
we
dared
every
thing
for
the
sake
of
dining
beside
our
beautiful
rippling
stream
and
watching
the
bright
sunbeams
dancing
on
the
grassy
bank
at
such
a
distance
from
our
retreat
that
they
could
not
heat
us
a
little
below
the
basin
that
cooled
our
wine
was
a
cascade
of
sufficient
dimensions
to
give
us
all
the
music
of
a
waterfall
and
all
the
sparkling
brightness
of
clear
water
when
it
is
broken
again
and
again
by
jutting
crags
to
sit
beside
this
miniature
cascade
and
read
or
dream
away
a
day
was
one
of
our
greatest
pleasures
it
was
indeed
a
mortifying
fact
that
whenever
we
found
out
a
picturesque
nook
where
turf
and
moss
and
deep
shade
and
a
crystal
stream
and
fallen
trees
majestic
in
their
ruin
tempted
us
to
sit
down
and
be
very
cool
and
very
happy
we
invariably
found
that
that
spot
lay
under
the
imputation
of
malaria
a
row
upon
the
ohio
was
another
of
our
favourite
amusements
but
in
this
i
believe
we
were
also
very
singular
for
often
when
enjoying
it
we
were
shouted
at
by
the
young
on
the
banks
as
if
we
had
been
so
many
monsters
the
only
rural
amusement
in
which
we
ever
saw
any
of
the
natives
engaged
was
eating
strawberries
and
cream
in
a
pretty
garden
about
three
miles
from
the
town
here
we
actually
met
three
or
four
carriages
a
degree
of
dissipation
that
i
never
witnessed
on
any
other
occasion
the
strawberries
were
tolerable
strawberries
but
the
cream
was
the
vilest
and
the
charge
half
a
dollar
to
each
person
which
being
about
the
price
of
half
a
fat
sheep
i
thought
pretty
considerable
much
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
use
an
expressive
phrase
of
the
country
we
had
repeatedly
been
told
by
those
who
knew
the
land
that
the
was
the
great
trial
to
the
health
of
europeans
settled
in
america
but
we
had
now
reached
the
middle
of
our
second
august
and
with
the
exception
of
the
fever
one
of
my
sons
had
suffered
from
the
summer
after
our
arrival
we
had
all
enjoyed
perfect
health
but
i
was
now
doomed
to
feel
the
truth
of
the
above
prediction
for
before
the
end
of
august
i
fell
low
before
the
monster
that
is
for
ever
stalking
through
that
land
of
lakes
and
rivers
breathing
fever
and
death
around
it
was
nine
weeks
before
i
left
my
room
and
when
i
did
i
looked
more
fit
to
walk
into
the
potter
field
as
they
call
the
english
burying
ground
than
any
where
else
long
after
my
general
health
was
pretty
well
restored
i
suffered
from
the
effect
of
the
fever
in
my
limbs
and
lay
in
bed
reading
several
weeks
after
i
had
been
pronounced
convalescent
several
american
novels
were
brought
me
flint
francis
berrian
is
excellent
a
little
wild
and
romantic
but
containing
scenes
of
interest
and
pathos
hope
leslie
and
redwood
by
miss
sedgewick
an
american
lady
have
both
great
merit
and
i
now
first
read
the
whole
of
cooper
novels
by
the
time
these
american
studies
were
completed
i
never
closed
my
eyes
without
seeing
myriads
of
bloody
scalps
floating
round
me
long
slender
figures
of
red
indians
crept
through
my
dreams
with
noiseless
tread
panthers
flared
forests
blazed
and
which
ever
way
i
fled
a
light
foot
a
keen
eye
and
a
long
rifle
were
sure
to
be
on
my
trail
an
additional
ounce
of
calomel
hardly
sufficed
to
neutralize
the
effect
of
these
and
adventures
i
was
advised
to
plunge
immediately
into
a
course
of
fashionable
novels
it
was
a
great
relief
to
me
but
as
my
head
was
by
no
means
very
clear
i
sometimes
jumbled
strangely
together
the
civilized
rogues
and
assassins
of
bulwer
and
the
wild
men
women
and
children
slayers
of
cooper
and
truly
between
them
i
passed
my
dreams
in
very
bad
company
still
i
could
not
stand
nor
even
sit
upright
what
was
i
to
read
next
a
happy
thought
struck
me
i
determined
upon
beginning
with
waverley
and
reading
through
not
for
the
first
time
certainly
the
whole
series
and
what
a
world
did
i
enter
upon
the
wholesome
vigour
of
every
page
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
my
nerves
i
ceased
to
be
languid
and
fretful
and
though
still
a
cripple
i
certainly
enjoyed
myself
most
completely
as
long
as
my
treat
lasted
but
this
was
a
shorter
time
than
any
one
would
believe
who
has
not
found
how
such
volumes
melt
before
the
constant
reading
of
a
long
idle
day
when
it
was
over
however
i
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
i
could
walk
half
a
dozen
yards
at
a
time
and
take
short
airings
in
an
open
carriage
and
better
still
could
sleep
quietly
it
was
no
very
agreeable
conviction
which
greeted
my
recovery
that
our
cincinnati
speculation
for
my
son
would
in
no
way
answer
our
expectation
and
very
soon
after
he
was
again
seized
with
the
bilious
fever
of
the
country
which
terminated
in
that
most
distressing
of
all
maladies
an
ague
i
never
witnessed
is
effects
before
and
therefore
made
my
self
extremely
miserable
at
what
those
around
me
considered
of
no
consequence
i
believe
this
frightful
complaint
is
not
immediately
dangerous
but
i
never
can
believe
that
the
violent
and
sudden
prostration
of
strength
the
dreadfully
convulsive
movements
which
distort
the
limbs
the
livid
hue
that
spreads
itself
over
the
complexion
can
take
place
without
shaking
the
seat
of
health
and
life
repeatedly
we
thought
the
malady
cured
and
for
a
few
days
the
poor
sufferer
believed
himself
restored
to
health
and
strength
but
again
and
again
it
returned
upon
him
and
he
began
to
give
himself
up
as
the
victim
of
ill
health
my
own
health
was
still
very
infirm
and
it
took
but
little
time
to
decide
that
we
must
leave
cincinnati
the
only
impediment
to
this
was
the
fear
that
trollope
who
was
to
join
us
in
the
spring
might
have
set
out
and
thus
arrive
at
cincinnati
after
we
had
left
it
however
as
the
time
he
had
talked
of
leaving
england
was
later
in
the
season
i
decided
upon
running
the
risk
but
the
winter
had
set
in
with
great
severity
and
the
river
being
frozen
the
could
not
run
the
frost
continued
unbroken
through
the
whole
of
february
and
we
were
almost
weary
of
waiting
for
its
departure
which
was
to
be
the
signal
of
ours
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
on
the
licking
and
ohio
formed
a
most
striking
spectacle
at
night
the
river
presented
a
solid
surface
of
ice
but
in
the
morning
it
shewed
a
collection
of
floating
icebergs
of
every
imaginable
size
and
form
whirling
against
each
other
with
frightful
violence
and
with
a
noise
unlike
any
sound
i
remember
this
sight
was
a
very
welcome
one
as
it
gave
us
hopes
of
immediate
departure
but
my
courage
failed
when
i
heard
that
one
or
two
weary
of
waiting
meant
to
start
on
the
morrow
the
idea
of
running
against
these
floating
islands
was
really
alarming
and
i
was
told
by
many
that
my
fears
were
not
without
foundation
for
that
repeated
accidents
had
happened
from
this
cause
and
then
they
talked
of
the
little
miami
river
whose
mouth
we
were
to
pass
sending
down
masses
of
ice
that
might
stop
our
progress
in
short
we
waited
patiently
and
prudently
till
the
learned
in
such
matters
told
us
that
we
might
start
with
safety
chapter
departure
from
cincinnati
society
on
board
the
arrival
at
wheeling
bel
esprit
we
quitted
cincinnati
the
beginning
of
march
and
i
believe
there
was
not
one
of
our
party
who
did
not
experience
a
sensation
of
pleasure
in
leaving
it
we
had
seen
again
and
again
all
the
queer
varieties
of
it
little
world
had
amused
ourselves
with
it
consequence
it
taste
and
it
ton
till
they
had
ceased
to
be
amusing
not
a
hill
was
left
unclimbed
nor
a
forest
path
unexplored
and
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
individuals
who
bore
heads
and
hearts
peculiar
to
no
clime
but
which
are
found
scattered
through
the
world
as
if
to
keep
us
every
where
in
good
humour
with
it
we
left
nought
to
regret
at
cincinnati
the
only
regret
was
that
we
had
ever
entered
it
for
we
had
wasted
health
time
and
money
there
we
got
on
board
the
which
was
to
convey
us
to
wheeling
at
three
she
was
a
noble
boat
by
far
the
finest
we
had
seen
the
cabins
were
above
and
the
deck
passengers
as
they
are
called
were
accommodated
below
in
front
of
the
cabin
was
an
ample
balcony
sheltered
by
an
awning
chairs
and
sofas
were
placed
there
and
even
at
that
early
season
nearly
all
the
female
passengers
passed
the
whole
day
there
the
name
of
this
splendid
vessel
was
the
lady
franklin
by
the
way
i
was
often
amused
by
the
evident
fondness
which
the
americans
shew
for
titles
the
wives
of
their
eminent
men
constantly
receive
that
of
lady
we
heard
of
lady
washington
lady
jackson
and
many
other
ladies
the
eternal
recurrence
of
their
militia
titles
is
particularly
ludicrous
met
with
as
they
are
among
the
but
i
think
the
most
remarkable
instance
which
we
noticed
of
this
sort
of
aristocratical
longing
occurred
at
cincinnati
t
in
speaking
of
a
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
called
him
m
general
m
sir
observed
his
companion
i
beg
his
pardon
rejoined
t
but
i
was
not
aware
of
his
being
in
the
army
no
sir
not
in
the
army
was
the
reply
but
he
was
general
of
the
district
the
weather
was
delightful
all
trace
of
winter
had
disappeared
and
we
again
found
ourselves
moving
rapidly
up
the
stream
and
enjoying
all
the
beauty
of
the
ohio
of
the
male
part
of
the
passengers
we
saw
nothing
excepting
at
the
short
silent
periods
allotted
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
at
which
we
were
permitted
to
enter
their
cabin
and
place
ourselves
at
their
table
in
the
lady
franklin
we
had
decidedly
the
best
of
it
for
we
had
our
beautiful
balcony
to
sit
in
in
all
respects
indeed
our
accommodations
were
very
superior
to
what
we
had
found
in
the
boat
which
brought
us
from
new
orleans
to
memphis
where
we
were
stowed
away
in
a
miserable
little
chamber
close
aft
under
the
cabin
and
given
to
understand
by
the
steward
that
it
was
our
duty
there
to
remain
till
such
time
as
the
bell
should
ring
for
meals
the
separation
of
the
sexes
so
often
mentioned
is
no
where
more
remarkable
than
on
board
the
among
the
passengers
on
this
occasion
we
had
a
gentleman
and
his
wife
who
really
appeared
to
suffer
from
the
arrangement
she
was
an
invalid
and
he
was
extremely
attentive
to
her
as
far
at
least
as
the
regulations
permitted
when
the
steward
opened
the
door
of
communication
between
the
cabins
to
permit
our
approaching
the
table
her
husband
was
always
stationed
close
to
it
to
hand
her
to
her
place
and
when
he
accompanied
her
again
to
the
door
he
always
lingered
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
forbidden
threshold
nor
left
his
station
till
the
last
female
had
passed
through
once
or
twice
he
ventured
when
all
but
his
wife
were
on
the
balcony
to
sit
down
beside
her
for
a
moment
in
our
cabin
but
the
instant
either
of
us
entered
he
started
like
a
guilty
thing
and
vanished
while
mentioning
the
peculiar
arrangements
which
are
thought
necessary
to
the
delicacy
of
the
american
ladies
or
the
comfort
of
the
american
gentlemen
i
am
tempted
to
allude
to
a
story
which
i
saw
in
the
papers
respecting
the
visits
which
it
was
stated
captain
basil
hall
persisted
in
making
to
his
wife
and
child
on
board
a
mississippi
after
bring
informed
that
doing
so
was
contrary
to
law
now
i
happen
to
know
that
neither
himself
or
hall
ever
entered
the
ladies
cabin
during
the
whole
voyage
as
they
occupied
a
which
captain
hall
had
secured
for
his
party
the
veracity
of
newspaper
statements
is
perhaps
nowhere
quite
unimpeachable
but
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
there
are
more
direct
falsehoods
circulated
by
the
american
newspapers
than
by
all
the
others
in
the
world
and
the
one
great
and
source
of
these
voluminous
works
of
imagination
is
england
and
the
english
how
differently
would
such
a
voyage
be
managed
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
were
such
a
mode
of
travelling
possible
there
such
long
calm
river
excursions
would
be
perfectly
delightful
and
parties
would
be
perpetually
formed
to
enjoy
them
even
were
all
the
parties
strangers
to
each
other
the
knowledge
that
they
were
to
eat
drink
and
steam
away
together
for
a
week
or
fortnight
would
induce
something
like
a
social
feeling
in
any
other
country
it
is
true
that
the
men
became
sufficiently
acquainted
to
game
together
and
we
were
told
that
the
opportunity
was
considered
as
so
favourable
that
no
boat
left
new
orleans
without
having
as
cabin
passengers
one
or
two
gentlemen
from
that
city
whose
profession
it
was
to
drill
the
elements
of
a
pack
of
cards
to
profitable
duty
this
doubtless
is
an
additional
reason
for
the
strict
exclusion
of
the
ladies
from
their
society
the
constant
drinking
of
spirits
is
another
for
though
they
do
not
scruple
to
chew
tobacco
and
to
spit
incessantly
in
the
presence
of
women
they
generally
prefer
drinking
and
gaming
in
their
absence
i
often
used
to
amuse
myself
with
fancying
the
different
scene
which
such
a
vessel
would
display
in
europe
the
noble
length
of
the
gentlemen
cabin
would
be
put
into
requisition
for
a
dance
while
that
of
the
ladies
with
their
delicious
balcony
would
be
employed
for
refreshments
instead
of
sitting
down
in
two
long
silent
melancholy
rows
to
swallow
as
much
coffee
and
as
could
be
achieved
in
ten
minutes
then
song
and
music
would
be
heard
borne
along
by
the
midnight
breeze
but
on
the
ohio
when
light
failed
to
shew
us
the
bluffs
and
the
trees
with
their
images
inverted
in
the
stream
we
crept
into
our
little
cots
listening
to
the
ceaseless
churning
of
the
engine
in
hope
it
would
prove
a
lullaby
till
morning
we
were
three
days
in
reaching
wheeling
where
we
arrived
at
last
at
two
in
the
morning
an
uncomfortable
hour
to
disembark
with
a
good
deal
of
luggage
as
the
was
obliged
to
go
on
immediately
but
we
were
instantly
supplied
with
a
dray
and
in
a
few
moments
found
ourselves
comfortably
seated
before
a
good
fire
at
an
hotel
near
the
our
rooms
with
fires
in
them
were
immediately
ready
for
us
and
refreshments
brought
with
all
that
sedulous
attention
which
in
this
country
distinguishes
a
slave
state
in
making
this
observation
i
am
very
far
from
intending
to
advocate
the
system
of
slavery
i
conceive
it
to
be
essentially
wrong
but
so
far
as
my
observation
has
extended
i
think
its
influence
is
far
less
injurious
to
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
people
than
the
fallacious
ideas
of
equality
which
are
so
fondly
cherished
by
the
working
classes
of
the
white
population
in
america
that
these
ideas
are
fallacious
is
obvious
for
in
point
of
fact
the
man
possessed
of
dollars
does
command
the
services
of
the
man
possessed
of
no
dollars
but
these
services
are
given
grudgingly
and
of
necessity
with
no
appearance
of
cheerful
goodwill
on
the
one
side
or
of
kindly
interest
on
the
other
i
never
failed
to
mark
the
difference
on
entering
a
slave
state
i
was
immediately
comfortable
and
at
my
ease
and
felt
that
the
intercourse
between
me
and
those
who
served
me
was
profitable
to
both
parties
and
painful
to
neither
it
was
not
till
i
had
leisure
for
more
minute
observation
that
i
felt
aware
of
the
influence
of
slavery
upon
the
owners
of
slaves
when
i
did
i
confess
i
could
not
but
think
that
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
had
contrived
by
their
political
alchymy
to
extract
all
that
was
most
noxious
both
in
democracy
and
in
slavery
and
had
poured
the
strange
mixture
through
every
vein
of
the
moral
organization
of
their
country
wheeling
is
the
state
of
virginia
and
appears
to
be
a
flourishing
town
it
is
the
point
at
which
most
travellers
from
the
west
leave
the
ohio
to
take
the
stages
which
travel
the
mountain
road
to
the
atlantic
cities
it
has
many
manufactories
among
others
one
for
blowing
and
cutting
glass
which
we
visited
we
were
told
by
the
workmen
that
the
articles
finished
there
were
equal
to
any
in
the
world
but
my
eyes
refused
their
assent
the
cutting
was
very
good
though
by
no
means
equal
to
what
we
see
in
daily
use
in
london
but
the
chief
inferiority
is
in
the
material
which
is
never
altogether
free
from
colour
i
had
observed
this
also
in
the
glass
of
the
pittsburgh
manufactory
the
labour
bestowed
on
it
always
appearing
greater
than
the
glass
deserved
they
told
us
also
that
they
were
rapidly
improving
in
the
art
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
was
true
wheeling
has
little
of
beauty
to
distinguish
it
except
the
ever
lovely
ohio
to
which
we
here
bid
adieu
and
a
fine
bold
hill
which
rises
immediately
behind
the
town
this
hill
as
well
as
every
other
in
the
neighbourhood
is
bored
for
coal
their
mines
are
all
horizontal
the
coal
burns
well
but
with
a
very
black
and
dirty
cinder
we
found
the
coach
by
which
we
meant
to
proceed
to
little
washington
full
and
learnt
that
we
must
wait
two
days
before
it
would
again
leave
the
town
posting
was
never
heard
of
in
the
country
and
the
mail
travelled
all
night
which
i
did
not
approve
of
we
therefore
found
ourselves
compelled
to
pass
two
days
at
the
wheeling
hotel
i
know
not
how
this
weary
interval
would
have
worn
away
had
it
not
been
for
the
fortunate
circumstance
of
our
meeting
with
a
among
the
boarders
there
we
descended
to
the
common
sitting
room
for
private
parlours
there
are
none
before
breakfast
the
morning
after
our
arrival
several
ordinary
individuals
entered
till
the
party
amounted
to
eight
or
nine
again
the
door
opened
and
in
swam
a
female
who
had
once
certainly
been
handsome
and
who
it
was
equally
evident
still
thought
herself
so
she
was
tall
and
well
formed
dressed
in
black
with
many
gaudy
trinkets
about
her
a
scarlet
relieved
the
sombre
colour
of
her
dress
and
a
very
smart
little
cap
at
the
back
of
her
head
set
off
an
immense
quantity
of
sable
hair
which
naturally
or
artificially
adorned
her
forehead
a
becoming
quantity
of
rouge
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
her
figure
which
had
a
degree
of
pretension
about
it
that
immediately
attracted
our
notice
she
talked
fluently
and
without
any
american
restraint
and
i
began
to
be
greatly
puzzled
as
to
who
or
what
she
could
be
a
lady
in
the
english
sense
of
the
word
i
was
sure
she
was
not
and
she
was
a
little
like
an
american
female
of
what
they
call
good
standing
a
beautiful
girl
of
seventeen
entered
soon
after
and
called
her
ma
and
both
mother
and
daughter
chattered
away
about
themselves
and
their
concerns
in
a
manner
that
greatly
increased
my
puzzle
after
breakfast
being
much
in
want
of
amusement
i
seated
myself
by
her
and
entered
into
conversation
i
found
her
nothing
loth
and
in
about
a
minute
and
a
half
she
put
a
card
into
my
hand
setting
forth
that
she
taught
the
art
of
painting
upon
velvet
in
all
its
branches
she
stated
to
me
with
great
volubility
that
no
one
but
herself
and
her
daughter
knew
any
thing
of
this
invaluable
branch
of
art
but
that
for
dollars
they
were
willing
to
communicate
all
they
knew
in
five
minutes
more
she
informed
me
that
she
was
the
author
of
some
of
the
most
cutting
satires
in
the
language
and
then
she
presented
me
a
paper
containing
a
prospectus
as
she
called
it
of
a
novel
upon
an
entirely
new
construction
i
was
strangely
tempted
to
ask
her
if
it
went
by
steam
but
she
left
me
no
time
to
ask
any
thing
for
continuing
the
autobiography
she
had
so
obligingly
begun
she
said
i
used
to
write
against
all
the
adams
faction
i
will
go
up
stairs
in
a
moment
and
fetch
you
down
my
against
that
side
but
oh
my
dear
madam
it
is
really
frightful
to
think
how
talent
is
neglected
in
this
country
ah
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
my
dear
madam
you
will
tell
me
that
it
is
not
so
in
yours
i
know
it
but
alas
the
atlantic
however
i
really
must
tell
you
how
i
have
been
treated
not
only
did
i
publish
the
most
biting
against
the
adams
faction
but
i
wrote
songs
and
odes
in
honour
of
jackson
and
my
daughter
cordelia
sang
a
splendid
song
of
my
writing
before
eight
hundred
people
entirely
and
altogether
written
in
his
praise
and
would
you
believe
it
my
dear
madam
he
has
never
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
me
or
made
me
the
least
remuneration
but
you
ca
suppose
i
mean
to
bear
it
quietly
no
i
promise
him
that
is
not
my
way
the
novel
i
have
just
mentioned
to
you
was
began
as
a
sentimental
romance
that
perhaps
after
all
is
my
real
forte
but
after
the
provocation
i
received
at
washington
i
turned
it
into
a
novel
and
i
now
call
it
doodle
by
the
way
my
dear
madam
i
think
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
cross
that
terrible
atlantic
i
should
be
pretty
well
received
after
writing
yankee
doodle
court
i
took
the
opportunity
of
a
slight
pause
to
ask
her
to
what
party
she
now
belonged
since
she
had
forsworn
both
adams
and
jackson
oh
clay
clay
for
ever
he
is
a
real
republican
the
others
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
tyrants
when
next
i
entered
the
she
again
addressed
me
to
deplore
the
degenerate
taste
of
the
age
would
you
believe
it
i
have
at
this
moment
a
comedy
ready
for
representation
i
call
it
mad
philosopher
it
is
really
admirable
and
its
success
certain
if
i
could
get
it
played
i
assure
you
the
neglect
i
meet
with
amounts
perfectly
to
persecution
but
i
have
found
out
how
to
pay
them
and
to
make
my
own
fortune
as
she
constantly
pronounced
satire
is
the
only
weapon
that
can
revenge
neglect
and
i
flatter
myself
i
know
how
to
use
it
do
me
the
favour
to
look
at
this
she
then
presented
me
with
a
tiny
pamphlet
whose
price
she
informed
me
was
cents
which
i
readily
paid
to
become
the
possessor
of
this
the
composition
was
pretty
nearly
such
as
i
anticipated
excepting
that
the
english
language
was
done
to
death
by
her
pen
still
more
than
by
her
tongue
the
epigraph
which
was
subscribed
original
was
as
follows
your
popularity
on
the
decline
you
had
your
triumph
now
i
have
mine
these
are
rather
a
favourable
specimen
of
the
verses
that
follow
in
a
subsequent
conversation
she
made
me
acquainted
with
another
talent
informing
me
that
she
had
played
the
part
of
charlotte
in
a
la
when
general
lafayette
honoured
the
theatre
at
cincinnati
with
his
presence
she
now
appeared
to
have
run
out
the
catalogue
of
her
accomplishments
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
my
new
acquaintance
was
a
strolling
player
but
she
seemed
to
guess
my
thoughts
for
she
presently
added
it
was
a
thespian
corps
that
played
before
the
general
chapter
departure
for
the
mountains
in
the
stage
scenery
of
the
alleghany
haggerstown
the
weather
was
bleak
and
disagreeable
during
the
two
days
we
were
obliged
to
remain
at
wheeling
i
had
got
heartily
tired
of
my
gifted
friend
we
had
walked
up
every
side
of
the
rugged
hill
and
i
set
off
on
my
journey
towards
the
mountains
with
more
pleasure
than
is
generally
felt
in
quitting
a
pillow
before
daylight
for
a
cold
corner
in
a
rumbling
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
got
into
an
american
stage
though
we
had
traversed
above
two
thousand
miles
of
the
country
and
we
had
all
the
satisfaction
in
it
which
could
be
derived
from
the
conviction
that
we
were
travelling
in
a
foreign
land
this
vehicle
had
no
step
and
we
climbed
into
it
by
a
ladder
when
that
was
removed
i
remembered
with
some
dismay
that
the
females
at
least
were
much
in
the
predicament
of
sailors
who
in
danger
have
no
door
to
creep
out
but
when
a
misfortune
is
absolutely
inevitable
we
are
apt
to
bear
it
remarkably
well
who
would
utter
that
constant
petition
of
ladies
on
rough
roads
let
me
get
out
when
compliance
would
oblige
the
pleader
to
make
a
step
of
five
feet
before
she
could
touch
the
ground
the
coach
had
three
rows
of
seats
each
calculated
to
hold
three
persons
and
as
we
were
only
six
we
had
in
the
phrase
of
milton
to
inhabit
lax
this
exalted
abode
and
accordingly
we
were
for
some
miles
tossed
about
like
a
few
potatoes
in
a
wheelbarrow
our
knees
elbows
and
heads
required
too
much
care
for
their
protection
to
allow
us
leisure
to
look
out
of
the
windows
but
at
length
the
road
became
smoother
and
we
became
more
skilful
in
the
art
of
balancing
ourselves
so
as
to
meet
the
concussion
with
less
danger
of
dislocation
we
then
found
that
we
were
travelling
through
a
very
beautiful
country
essentially
different
in
its
features
from
what
we
had
been
accustomed
to
round
cincinnati
it
is
true
we
had
left
belle
behind
us
but
the
many
limpid
and
rapid
little
streams
that
danced
through
the
landscape
to
join
it
more
than
atoned
for
its
loss
the
country
already
wore
an
air
of
more
careful
husbandry
and
the
very
circumstance
of
a
wide
and
costly
road
though
not
a
very
smooth
one
which
in
theory
might
be
supposed
to
injure
picturesque
effect
was
beautiful
to
us
who
since
we
had
entered
the
muddy
mouth
of
the
mississippi
had
never
seen
any
thing
except
a
and
the
professing
to
have
so
noble
an
object
as
public
accommodation
through
the
whole
of
the
vast
region
we
had
passed
excepting
at
new
orleans
itself
every
trace
of
the
art
of
man
appeared
to
be
confined
to
the
individual
effort
of
getting
along
which
in
western
phrase
means
contriving
to
live
with
as
small
a
portion
of
the
incumbrances
of
civilized
society
as
possible
this
road
was
made
at
the
expense
of
the
government
as
far
as
cumberland
a
town
situated
among
the
alleghany
mountains
and
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
must
have
been
a
work
of
great
cost
i
regretted
not
having
counted
the
number
of
bridges
between
wheeling
and
little
washington
a
distance
of
miles
over
one
stream
only
there
are
all
passed
by
the
road
they
frequently
occurred
within
a
hundred
yards
of
each
other
so
serpentine
is
its
course
they
are
built
of
stone
and
sometimes
very
neatly
finished
little
washington
is
in
pennsylvania
across
a
corner
of
which
the
road
runs
this
is
a
free
state
but
we
were
still
waited
upon
by
negroes
hired
from
the
neighbouring
state
of
virginia
we
arrived
at
night
and
set
off
again
at
four
in
the
morning
all
therefore
that
we
saw
of
little
washington
was
its
hotel
which
was
clean
and
comfortable
the
first
part
of
the
next
day
journey
was
through
a
country
much
less
interesting
its
character
was
unvaried
for
nearly
thirty
miles
consisting
of
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
hills
as
soon
as
we
had
wearily
dragged
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
we
began
to
rumble
down
the
other
side
as
rapidly
as
our
four
horses
could
trot
and
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
bottom
than
we
began
to
crawl
up
again
the
trees
constantly
so
thick
and
so
high
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
seeing
fifty
yards
in
any
direction
the
latter
part
of
the
day
however
amply
repaid
us
at
four
we
began
to
ascend
the
alleghany
mountains
the
first
ridge
on
the
western
side
is
called
laurel
hill
and
takes
its
name
from
the
profuse
quantity
of
evergreens
with
which
it
is
covered
not
any
among
them
however
being
the
shrub
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
laurel
the
whole
of
this
mountain
region
through
ninety
miles
of
which
the
road
passes
is
a
garden
the
almost
incredible
variety
of
plants
and
the
lavish
profusion
of
their
growth
produce
an
effect
perfectly
enchanting
i
really
can
hardly
conceive
a
higher
enjoyment
than
a
botanical
tour
among
the
alleghany
mountains
to
any
one
who
had
science
enough
to
profit
by
it
the
magnificent
rhododendron
first
caught
our
eyes
it
fringes
every
cliff
nestles
beneath
every
rock
and
blooms
around
every
tree
the
azalia
the
shumac
and
every
variety
of
that
beautiful
mischief
the
kalmia
are
in
equal
profusion
cedars
of
every
size
and
form
were
above
around
and
underneath
us
firs
more
beautiful
and
more
various
than
i
had
ever
seen
were
in
equal
abundance
but
i
know
not
whether
they
were
really
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
europe
or
only
in
infinitely
greater
splendour
and
perfection
of
growth
the
species
called
the
hemlock
is
i
think
second
to
the
cedar
only
in
magnificence
oak
and
beech
with
innumerable
roses
and
wild
vines
hanging
in
beautiful
confusion
among
their
branches
were
in
many
places
scattered
among
the
evergreens
the
earth
was
carpeted
with
various
mosses
and
creeping
plants
and
though
still
in
the
month
of
march
not
a
trace
of
the
nakedness
of
winter
could
be
seen
such
was
the
scenery
that
shewed
us
we
were
indeed
among
the
alleghany
mountains
as
our
noble
the
semplon
of
america
rose
higher
and
higher
all
that
is
noblest
in
nature
was
joined
to
all
that
is
sweetest
the
blue
tops
of
the
higher
ridges
formed
the
outline
huge
masses
of
rock
rose
above
us
on
the
left
half
hid
at
intervals
by
the
bright
green
shrubs
while
to
the
right
we
looked
down
upon
the
tops
of
the
pines
and
cedars
which
clothed
the
bottom
i
had
no
idea
of
the
endless
variety
of
mountain
scenery
my
notions
had
been
of
rocks
and
precipices
of
torrents
and
of
forest
trees
but
i
little
expected
that
the
first
spot
which
should
recall
the
garden
scenery
of
our
beautiful
england
would
be
found
among
the
moutains
yet
so
it
was
from
the
time
i
entered
america
i
had
never
seen
the
slightest
approach
to
what
we
call
a
few
very
worthless
and
scentless
flowers
were
all
the
specimens
of
gardening
i
had
seen
in
ohio
no
attempt
at
garden
scenery
was
ever
dreamed
of
and
it
was
with
the
sort
of
delight
with
which
one
meets
an
old
friend
that
we
looked
on
the
lovely
mixture
of
trees
shrubs
and
flowers
that
now
continually
met
our
eyes
often
on
descending
into
the
narrow
vallies
we
found
a
little
spot
of
cultivation
a
garden
or
a
field
hedged
round
with
shumacs
rhododendrons
and
azalias
and
a
cottage
covered
with
roses
these
vallies
are
spots
of
great
beauty
a
clear
stream
is
always
found
running
through
them
which
is
generally
converted
to
the
use
of
the
miller
at
some
point
not
far
from
the
road
and
here
as
on
the
heights
great
beauty
of
colouring
is
given
to
the
landscape
by
the
bright
hue
of
the
vegetation
and
the
sober
grey
of
the
rocks
the
first
night
we
passed
among
the
mountains
recalled
us
painfully
from
the
enjoyment
of
nature
to
all
the
petty
miseries
of
personal
discomfort
arrived
at
our
inn
a
forlorn
parlour
filled
with
the
blended
fumes
of
tobacco
and
whiskey
received
us
and
chilled
as
we
began
to
feel
ourselves
with
the
mountain
air
we
preferred
going
to
our
cold
bedrooms
rather
than
sup
in
such
an
atmosphere
we
found
linen
on
the
beds
which
they
assured
us
had
only
been
used
few
every
kind
of
refreshment
we
asked
for
we
were
answered
we
do
not
happen
to
have
that
article
we
were
still
in
pennsylvania
and
no
longer
waited
upon
by
slaves
it
was
therefore
with
great
difficulty
that
we
procured
a
fire
in
our
bedrooms
from
the
who
condescended
to
officiate
as
chambermaid
and
with
much
more
that
we
extorted
clean
linen
for
our
beds
that
done
we
patiently
crept
into
them
supperless
while
she
made
her
exit
muttering
about
the
difficulty
of
fixing
english
folks
the
next
morning
cheered
our
spirits
again
we
now
enjoyed
a
new
kind
of
alpine
witchery
the
clouds
were
floating
around
and
below
us
and
the
distant
peaks
were
indistinctly
visible
as
through
a
white
gauze
veil
which
was
gradually
lifted
up
till
the
sun
arose
and
again
let
in
upon
us
the
full
glory
of
these
interminable
heights
we
were
told
before
we
began
the
ascent
that
we
should
find
snow
four
inches
deep
on
the
road
but
as
yet
we
had
seen
none
and
indeed
it
was
with
difficulty
we
persuaded
ourselves
that
we
were
not
travelling
in
the
midst
of
summer
as
we
proceeded
however
we
found
the
northern
declivities
still
covered
with
it
and
at
length
towards
the
summit
the
road
itself
had
the
promised
four
inches
the
extreme
mildness
of
the
air
and
the
brilliant
hue
of
the
evergreens
contrasted
strangely
with
this
appearance
of
winter
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
the
snow
could
help
melting
in
such
an
atmosphere
again
and
again
we
enjoyed
all
the
exhilarating
sensations
that
such
scenes
must
necessarily
inspire
but
in
attempting
a
continued
description
of
our
progress
over
these
beautiful
mountains
i
could
only
tell
again
of
rocks
cedars
laurels
and
running
streams
of
blue
heights
and
green
vallies
yet
the
continually
varying
combinations
of
these
objects
afforded
us
unceasing
pleasure
from
one
point
above
any
neighbouring
ridge
we
looked
back
upon
the
enormous
valley
of
the
west
it
is
a
stupendous
view
but
having
gazed
upon
it
for
some
moments
we
turned
to
pursue
our
course
and
the
certainty
that
we
should
see
it
no
more
raised
no
sigh
of
regret
we
dined
on
the
second
day
at
a
beautiful
spot
which
we
were
told
was
the
highest
point
on
the
road
being
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
we
were
regaled
luxuriously
on
wild
turkey
and
mountain
venison
which
latter
is
infinitely
superior
to
any
furnished
by
the
forests
of
the
mississippi
or
the
ohio
the
vegetables
also
were
extremely
fine
and
we
were
told
by
a
pretty
girl
who
superintended
the
slaves
that
waited
on
us
for
we
were
again
in
virginia
that
the
vegetables
of
the
alleghany
were
reckoned
the
finest
in
america
she
told
us
also
that
wild
strawberries
were
profusely
abundant
and
very
fine
that
their
cows
found
for
themselves
during
the
summer
plenty
of
flowery
food
which
produced
a
copious
supply
of
milk
that
their
spring
gave
them
the
purest
water
of
icy
coldness
in
the
warmest
seasons
and
that
the
climate
was
the
most
delicious
in
the
world
for
though
the
thermometer
sometimes
stood
at
ninety
their
cool
breeze
never
failed
them
what
a
spot
to
turn
hermit
in
for
a
summer
my
eloquent
mountaineer
gave
me
some
specimens
of
ground
plants
far
unlike
any
thing
i
had
ever
seen
one
particularly
which
she
called
the
ground
pine
is
peculiar
as
she
told
me
to
the
alleghany
and
in
some
places
runs
over
whole
acres
of
ground
it
is
extremely
beautiful
the
rooms
were
very
prettily
decorated
with
this
elegant
plant
hung
round
it
in
festoons
in
many
places
the
clearing
has
been
considerable
the
road
passes
through
several
fine
farms
situated
in
the
sheltered
hollows
we
were
told
that
the
wolves
continue
to
annoy
them
severely
but
that
panthers
the
terror
of
the
west
are
never
seen
and
bears
very
rarely
of
snakes
they
confessed
they
had
abundance
but
very
few
that
were
considered
dangerous
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
the
monongehala
river
and
its
banks
gave
us
for
several
miles
a
beautiful
succession
of
wild
and
domestic
scenery
in
some
points
the
black
rock
rises
perpendicularly
from
its
margin
like
those
at
chepstow
at
others
a
mill
with
its
owner
cottage
its
and
its
poultry
present
a
delightful
image
of
industry
and
comfort
brownsville
is
a
busy
looking
little
town
built
upon
the
banks
of
this
river
it
would
be
pretty
were
it
not
stained
by
the
hue
of
coal
i
do
not
remember
in
england
to
have
seen
any
spot
however
near
a
coal
mine
so
dyed
in
black
as
wheeling
and
brownsville
at
this
place
we
crossed
the
monongehala
in
a
flat
which
very
commodiously
received
our
huge
coach
and
four
horses
on
leaving
the
black
little
town
we
were
again
cheered
by
abundance
of
evergreens
reflected
in
the
stream
with
fantastic
piles
of
rock
half
visible
through
the
pines
and
cedars
above
giving
often
the
idea
of
a
vast
gothic
castle
it
was
a
folly
i
confess
but
i
often
lamented
they
were
not
such
the
travelling
for
thousands
of
miles
without
meeting
any
nobler
trace
of
the
ages
that
are
passed
than
a
mass
of
rotten
leaves
or
a
fragment
of
fallen
rock
produces
a
heavy
earthly
effect
upon
the
imagination
which
can
hardly
be
described
and
for
which
the
greatest
beauty
of
scenery
can
furnish
only
an
occasional
and
transitory
remedy
our
second
night
in
the
mountains
was
past
at
a
solitary
house
of
rather
forlorn
appearance
but
we
fared
much
better
than
the
night
before
for
they
gave
us
clean
sheets
a
good
fire
and
no
scolding
we
again
started
at
four
in
the
morning
and
eagerly
watched
for
the
first
gleam
of
light
that
should
show
the
same
lovely
spectacle
we
had
seen
the
day
before
nor
were
we
disappointed
though
the
show
was
somewhat
different
the
vapours
caught
the
morning
ray
as
it
first
darted
over
the
mountain
top
and
passing
it
to
the
scene
below
we
seemed
enveloped
in
a
rainbow
we
had
now
but
one
ridge
left
to
pass
over
and
as
we
reached
the
top
and
looked
down
on
the
new
world
before
us
i
hardly
knew
whether
most
to
rejoice
that
all
the
toil
of
the
way
was
over
or
to
regret
that
our
mountain
journey
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
novelty
of
my
enjoyment
had
doubtless
added
much
to
its
keenness
i
have
never
been
familiar
with
mountain
scenery
wales
has
shewn
me
all
i
ever
saw
and
the
region
of
the
alleghany
alps
in
no
way
resembles
it
it
is
a
world
of
mountains
rising
around
you
in
every
direction
and
in
every
form
savage
vast
and
wild
yet
almost
at
every
step
some
lovely
spot
meets
your
eye
green
bright
and
blooming
as
the
most
cherished
nook
belonging
to
some
noble
flora
in
our
own
beautiful
land
it
is
a
ride
of
ninety
miles
through
kalmies
rhododendrons
azalias
vines
and
roses
sheltered
from
every
blast
that
blows
by
vast
masses
of
various
coloured
rocks
on
which
tall
pines
and
cedars
wave
their
dark
green
crests
while
in
every
direction
you
have
a
background
of
blue
mountain
tops
that
play
at
with
you
in
the
clouds
after
descending
the
last
ridge
we
reached
haggerstown
a
small
neat
place
between
a
town
and
a
village
and
here
by
the
piety
of
the
presbyterian
we
were
doomed
to
pass
an
entire
day
and
two
nights
as
the
accommodation
line
must
not
run
on
the
sabbath
i
must
however
mention
that
this
day
of
enforced
rest
was
sunday
saturday
evening
we
had
taken
in
at
cumberland
a
portly
passenger
whom
we
soon
discovered
to
be
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
coach
he
asked
us
with
great
politeness
if
we
should
wish
to
travel
on
the
sabbath
or
to
delay
our
journey
we
answered
that
we
would
rather
proceed
the
coach
then
shall
go
on
tomorrow
replied
the
liberal
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
accordingly
we
travelled
all
sunday
and
arrived
at
haggerstown
on
sunday
night
at
the
door
of
the
inn
our
civil
proprietor
left
us
but
when
we
enquired
of
the
waiter
at
what
hour
we
were
to
start
on
the
morrow
he
told
us
that
we
should
be
obliged
to
pass
the
whole
of
monday
there
as
the
coach
which
was
to
convey
us
forward
would
not
arrive
from
the
east
till
tuesday
morning
thus
we
discovered
that
the
waiving
the
by
the
proprietor
was
for
his
own
convenience
and
not
for
ours
and
that
we
were
to
be
tied
by
the
leg
for
hours
notwithstanding
this
was
quite
a
yankee
trick
luckily
for
us
the
inn
at
haggerstown
was
one
of
the
most
comfortable
i
ever
entered
it
was
there
that
we
became
fully
aware
that
we
had
left
western
america
behind
us
instead
of
being
scolded
as
we
literally
were
at
cincinnati
for
asking
for
a
private
we
here
had
two
without
asking
at
all
a
waiter
quite
il
summoned
us
to
breakfast
dinner
and
tea
which
we
found
prepared
with
abundance
and
even
elegance
the
master
of
the
house
met
us
at
the
door
of
the
and
after
asking
if
we
wished
for
any
thing
not
on
the
table
retired
the
charges
were
in
no
respect
higher
than
at
cincinnati
a
considerable
creek
called
conococheque
creek
runs
near
the
town
and
the
valley
through
which
it
passes
is
said
to
be
the
most
fertile
in
america
on
leaving
haggerstown
we
found
to
our
mortification
that
we
were
not
to
be
the
sole
occupants
of
the
bulky
accommodation
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
appearing
at
the
door
ready
to
share
it
with
us
we
again
started
at
four
by
the
light
of
a
bright
moon
and
rumbled
and
nodded
through
the
roads
considerably
worse
than
those
over
the
mountains
as
the
light
began
to
dawn
we
discovered
our
ladies
to
be
an
old
woman
and
her
pretty
daughter
soon
after
daylight
we
found
that
our
pace
became
much
slower
than
usual
and
that
from
time
to
time
our
driver
addressed
to
his
companion
on
the
box
many
and
vehement
exclamations
the
gentlemen
put
their
heads
out
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
but
could
get
no
intelligence
till
the
mail
overtook
us
when
both
vehicles
stopped
and
an
animated
colloquy
of
imprecations
took
place
between
the
coachmen
at
length
we
learnt
that
one
of
our
wheels
was
broken
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
it
impossible
for
us
to
proceed
upon
this
the
old
lady
immediately
became
a
principal
actor
in
the
scene
she
sprung
to
the
window
and
addressing
the
set
of
gentlemen
who
completely
filled
the
mail
exclaimed
gentlemen
ca
you
make
room
for
two
only
me
and
my
daughter
the
naive
simplicity
of
this
request
set
both
the
coaches
into
an
uproar
of
laughter
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
she
acted
upon
the
same
principle
as
the
pious
catholic
who
addressing
heaven
with
a
prayer
for
himself
alone
added
ne
pas
fatiguer
ta
our
laugh
however
never
daunted
the
old
woman
or
caused
her
for
a
moment
to
cease
the
reiteration
of
her
request
only
for
two
of
us
gentlemen
you
find
room
for
two
our
situation
was
really
very
embarrassing
but
not
to
laugh
was
impossible
after
it
was
ascertained
that
our
own
vehicle
could
not
convey
us
and
that
the
mail
had
not
even
room
for
two
we
decided
upon
walking
to
the
next
village
a
distance
fortunately
of
only
two
miles
and
awaiting
there
the
repair
of
the
wheel
we
immediately
set
off
at
the
brisk
pace
that
six
and
a
frosty
morning
in
march
were
likely
to
inspire
leaving
our
old
lady
and
her
pretty
daughter
considerably
in
the
rear
our
hearts
having
been
rather
hardened
by
the
exclusive
nature
of
her
prayer
for
aid
when
we
had
again
started
upon
our
new
wheel
the
driver
to
recover
the
time
he
had
lost
drove
rapidly
over
a
very
rough
road
in
consequence
of
which
our
old
lady
fell
into
a
perfect
agony
of
terror
and
her
cries
of
we
shall
be
over
oh
lord
we
shall
be
over
we
must
over
we
shall
be
over
lasted
to
the
end
of
the
stage
which
with
laughing
walking
and
shaking
was
a
most
fatiguing
one
chapter
baltimore
catholic
cathedral
mary
college
sermons
infant
school
as
we
advanced
towards
baltimore
the
look
of
cultivation
increased
the
fences
wore
an
air
of
greater
neatness
the
houses
began
to
look
like
the
abodes
of
competence
and
comfort
and
we
were
consoled
for
the
loss
of
the
beautiful
mountains
by
knowing
that
we
were
approaching
the
atlantic
from
the
time
of
quitting
the
ohio
river
though
unquestionably
it
merits
its
title
of
the
beautiful
especially
when
compared
with
the
dreary
mississippi
i
strongly
felt
the
truth
of
an
observation
i
remembered
to
have
heard
in
england
that
little
rivers
were
more
beautiful
than
great
ones
as
features
in
a
landscape
this
is
assuredly
the
case
where
the
stream
is
so
wide
that
the
objects
on
the
opposite
shore
are
indistinct
all
the
beauty
must
be
derived
from
the
water
itself
whereas
when
the
stream
is
narrow
it
becomes
only
a
part
of
the
composition
the
monongahela
which
is
in
size
between
the
wye
and
the
thames
is
infinitely
more
picturesque
than
the
ohio
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
vast
rivers
of
this
vast
country
you
must
be
upon
the
water
and
then
the
power
of
changing
the
scenery
by
now
approaching
one
shore
and
now
the
other
is
very
pleasing
but
travelling
as
we
now
did
by
land
the
wild
rocky
narrow
rapid
little
rivers
we
encountered
were
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
the
potapsco
near
which
the
road
runs
as
you
approach
baltimore
is
at
many
points
very
picturesque
the
large
blocks
of
grey
rock
now
close
upon
its
edge
and
now
retiring
to
give
room
for
a
few
acres
of
bright
green
herbage
give
great
interest
and
variety
to
its
course
baltimore
is
i
think
one
of
the
handsomest
cities
to
approach
in
the
union
the
noble
column
erected
to
the
memory
of
washington
and
the
catholic
cathedral
with
its
beautiful
dome
being
built
on
a
commanding
eminence
are
seen
at
a
great
distance
as
you
draw
nearer
many
other
domes
and
towers
become
visible
and
as
you
enter
you
feel
that
you
are
arrived
in
a
handsome
and
populous
city
we
took
up
our
quarters
at
an
excellent
hotel
where
the
coach
stopped
and
the
next
day
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
accommodation
in
the
house
of
a
lady
well
known
to
many
of
my
european
friends
with
her
and
her
amiable
daughter
we
spent
a
fortnight
very
agreeably
and
felt
quite
aware
that
if
we
had
not
arrived
in
london
or
paris
we
had
at
least
left
far
behind
the
tribes
of
the
west
as
the
kentuckians
call
themselves
baltimore
is
in
many
respects
a
beautiful
city
it
has
several
handsome
buildings
and
even
the
private
have
a
look
of
magnificence
from
the
abundance
of
white
marble
with
which
many
of
them
are
adorned
the
ample
flights
of
steps
and
the
lofty
door
frames
are
in
most
of
the
best
houses
formed
of
this
beautiful
material
this
has
been
called
the
city
of
monuments
from
its
having
the
stately
column
erected
to
the
memory
of
general
washington
and
which
bears
a
colossal
statue
of
him
at
the
top
and
another
pillar
of
less
dimensions
recording
some
victory
i
forget
which
both
these
are
of
brilliant
white
marble
there
are
also
several
pretty
marble
fountains
in
different
parts
of
the
city
which
greatly
add
to
its
beauty
these
are
not
it
is
true
quite
so
splendid
as
that
of
the
innocents
or
many
others
at
paris
but
they
are
fountains
of
clear
water
and
they
are
built
of
white
marble
there
is
one
which
is
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
a
roof
supported
by
light
columns
it
looks
like
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
genius
of
the
spring
the
water
flows
into
a
marble
cistern
to
which
you
descend
by
a
flight
of
steps
of
delicate
whiteness
and
return
by
another
these
steps
are
never
without
groups
of
negro
girls
some
carrying
the
water
on
their
heads
with
that
graceful
steadiness
of
step
which
requires
no
aid
from
the
hand
some
tripping
gaily
with
their
yet
unfilled
pitchers
many
of
them
singing
in
the
soft
rich
voice
peculiar
to
their
race
and
all
dressed
with
that
strict
attention
to
taste
and
smartness
which
seems
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
baltimore
females
of
all
ranks
the
catholic
cathedral
is
considered
by
all
americans
as
a
magnificent
church
but
it
can
hardly
be
so
classed
by
any
one
who
has
seen
the
churches
of
europe
its
interior
however
has
an
air
of
neatness
that
amounts
to
elegance
the
form
is
a
greek
cross
having
a
dome
in
the
centre
but
the
proportions
are
preserved
the
dome
is
too
low
and
the
arches
which
support
it
are
flattened
and
too
wide
for
their
height
on
each
side
of
the
high
altar
are
chapels
to
the
saviour
and
the
virgin
the
altars
in
these
as
well
as
the
high
altar
are
of
native
marble
of
different
colours
and
some
of
the
specimens
are
very
beautiful
the
decorations
of
the
altar
are
elegant
and
costly
the
prelate
is
a
cardinal
and
bears
moreover
the
title
of
archbishop
of
baltimore
there
are
several
paintings
in
different
parts
of
the
church
which
we
heard
were
considered
as
very
fine
there
are
two
presented
by
louis
xviii
one
of
these
is
the
descent
from
the
cross
by
paulin
guirin
the
other
a
copy
from
rubens
as
they
told
us
of
a
legend
of
louis
in
the
holy
land
but
the
composition
of
the
picture
is
so
abominably
bad
that
i
conceive
the
legend
of
its
being
after
rubens
must
be
as
fabulous
as
its
subject
the
admiration
in
which
these
pictures
are
held
is
an
incontestable
indication
of
the
state
of
art
in
the
country
we
attended
mass
in
this
church
the
sunday
after
our
arrival
and
i
was
perfectly
astonished
at
the
beauty
and
splendid
appearance
of
the
ladies
who
filled
it
excepting
on
a
very
brilliant
sunday
at
the
tuilleries
i
never
saw
so
shewy
a
display
of
morning
costume
and
i
think
i
never
saw
any
where
so
many
beautiful
women
at
one
glance
they
all
appeared
to
be
in
full
dress
and
were
really
all
beautiful
the
sermon
i
am
very
attentive
to
sermons
was
a
most
extraordinary
one
the
priest
began
by
telling
us
that
he
was
about
to
preach
upon
a
vice
that
he
would
not
mention
or
name
from
the
beginning
of
his
sermon
to
the
end
having
thus
excited
the
curiosity
of
his
hearers
by
proposing
a
riddle
to
them
he
began
adam
he
said
was
most
assuredly
the
first
who
had
committed
this
sin
and
cain
the
next
then
following
the
advice
given
by
the
listener
in
the
plaideurs
passons
au
deluge
je
vous
prie
he
went
on
to
mention
the
particular
propriety
of
family
on
this
point
and
then
continued
now
observe
what
did
god
shew
the
greatest
dislike
to
what
was
it
that
jesus
was
never
even
accused
of
what
was
it
joseph
hated
the
most
who
was
the
disciple
that
jesus
chose
for
his
friend
and
thus
he
went
on
for
nearly
an
hour
in
a
strain
that
was
often
perfectly
unintelligible
to
me
but
which
as
far
as
i
could
comprehend
it
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
expose
and
commentary
upon
private
anecdotes
which
he
had
found
or
fancied
he
had
found
in
the
bible
i
never
saw
the
attention
of
a
congregation
more
strongly
excited
and
i
really
wished
in
christian
charity
that
something
better
had
rewarded
it
there
are
a
vast
number
of
churches
and
chapels
in
the
city
in
proportion
to
its
extent
and
several
that
are
large
and
built
the
unitarian
church
is
the
handsomest
i
have
ever
seen
dedicated
to
that
mode
of
worship
but
the
prettiest
among
them
is
a
little
of
a
thing
belonging
to
the
catholic
college
the
institution
is
dedicated
to
mary
but
this
little
chapel
looks
though
in
the
midst
of
a
city
as
if
it
should
have
been
sacred
to
john
of
the
wilderness
there
is
a
sequestered
little
garden
behind
it
hardly
large
enough
to
plant
cabbages
in
which
yet
contains
a
mount
calvary
bearing
a
lofty
cross
the
tiny
path
which
leads
up
to
this
sacred
spot
is
not
much
wider
than
a
and
its
cedars
are
but
shrubs
but
all
is
in
proportion
and
notwithstanding
its
fairy
dimensions
there
is
something
of
holiness
and
quiet
beauty
about
it
that
excites
the
imagination
strangely
the
little
chapel
itself
has
the
same
touching
and
impressive
character
a
solitary
lamp
whose
glare
is
tempered
by
delicately
painted
glass
hangs
before
the
altar
the
light
of
day
enters
dimly
yet
richly
through
crimson
curtains
and
the
silence
with
which
the
doors
opened
from
time
to
time
admitting
a
youth
of
the
establishment
who
with
noiseless
tread
approached
the
altar
and
kneeling
offered
a
whispered
prayer
and
retired
had
something
in
it
more
calculated
perhaps
to
generate
holy
thoughts
than
even
the
swelling
anthem
heard
beneath
the
resounding
dome
of
peter
baltimore
has
a
handsome
museum
superintended
by
one
of
the
peale
family
well
known
for
their
devotion
to
natural
science
and
to
works
of
art
it
is
not
their
fault
if
the
specimens
which
they
are
enabled
to
display
in
the
latter
department
are
very
inferior
to
their
splendid
exhibitions
in
the
former
the
theatre
was
closed
when
we
were
in
baltimore
but
we
were
told
that
it
was
very
far
from
being
a
popular
or
fashionable
amusement
we
were
indeed
told
this
every
where
throughout
the
country
and
the
information
was
generally
accompanied
by
the
observation
that
the
opposition
of
the
clergy
was
the
cause
of
it
but
i
suspect
that
this
is
not
the
principal
cause
especially
among
the
men
who
if
they
were
so
implicit
in
their
obedience
to
the
clergy
would
certainly
be
more
constant
in
their
attendance
at
the
churches
nor
would
they
moreover
deem
the
theatre
more
righteous
because
an
english
actor
or
a
french
dancer
performed
there
yet
on
such
occasions
the
theatres
overflow
the
cause
i
think
is
in
the
character
of
the
people
i
never
saw
a
population
so
totally
divested
of
gaiety
there
is
no
trace
of
this
feeling
from
one
end
of
the
union
to
the
other
they
have
no
fetes
no
fairs
no
merry
makings
no
music
in
the
streets
no
punch
no
if
they
see
a
comedy
or
a
farce
they
may
laugh
at
it
but
they
can
do
very
well
without
it
and
the
consciousness
of
the
number
of
cents
that
must
be
paid
to
enter
a
theatre
i
am
very
sure
turns
more
steps
from
its
door
than
any
religious
feeling
a
distinguished
publisher
of
philadelphia
told
me
that
no
comic
publication
had
ever
yet
been
found
to
answer
in
america
we
arrived
at
baltimore
at
the
season
of
the
conference
i
must
be
excused
from
giving
any
very
distinct
explanation
of
this
term
as
i
did
not
receive
any
from
what
i
could
learn
it
much
resembles
a
revival
we
entered
many
churches
and
heard
much
preaching
and
not
one
of
the
reverend
orators
could
utter
the
reproach
si
bien
precher
ne
dorme
au
sermon
for
i
never
even
dosed
at
any
there
was
one
preacher
whose
manner
and
matter
were
so
peculiar
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
immediately
writing
down
a
part
of
his
discourse
as
a
specimen
i
confess
i
began
writing
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
for
i
waited
in
vain
for
a
beginning
it
was
as
follows
nevertheless
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
one
important
great
and
only
object
for
the
lord
is
mighty
his
works
are
great
likewise
wonderful
likewise
wise
likewise
merciful
and
moreover
we
must
ever
keep
in
mind
and
close
to
our
hearts
all
his
precious
blessings
and
unspeakable
mercies
and
overflowings
and
moreover
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
no
never
lose
sight
of
nor
ever
cease
to
remember
nor
ever
let
our
souls
forget
nor
ever
cease
to
dwell
upon
and
to
reverence
and
to
welcome
and
to
bless
and
to
give
thanks
and
to
sing
hosanna
and
give
praise
and
here
my
fragment
of
paper
failed
but
this
strain
continued
without
a
shadow
of
meaning
that
i
could
trace
and
in
a
voice
inconceivably
loud
for
more
than
an
hour
after
he
had
finished
his
sermon
a
scene
exactly
resembling
that
at
the
cincinnati
revival
took
place
two
other
priests
assisted
in
calling
forward
the
people
and
in
whispering
comfort
to
them
one
of
these
men
roared
out
in
the
coarsest
accents
do
you
want
to
go
to
hell
tonight
the
church
was
almost
entirely
filled
with
women
who
vied
with
each
other
in
howlings
and
contortions
of
the
body
many
of
them
tore
their
clothes
nearly
off
i
was
much
amused
spite
of
the
indignation
and
disgust
the
scene
inspired
by
the
vehemence
of
the
negro
part
of
the
congregation
they
seemed
determined
to
bellow
louder
than
all
the
rest
to
shew
at
once
their
piety
and
their
equality
at
this
same
chapel
a
few
nights
before
a
woman
had
fallen
in
a
fit
of
ecstasy
from
the
gallery
into
the
arms
of
the
people
below
a
height
of
twelve
feet
a
young
slave
who
waited
upon
us
at
table
when
this
was
mentioned
said
that
similar
accidents
had
frequently
happened
and
that
once
she
had
seen
it
herself
another
slave
in
the
house
told
us
that
she
liked
religion
right
well
but
that
she
never
took
fits
in
it
she
was
always
fixed
in
her
best
when
she
went
to
chapel
and
she
did
not
like
to
have
all
her
best
clothes
broke
up
we
visited
the
infant
school
instituted
in
this
city
by
ibbertson
an
amiable
and
intelligent
englishman
it
was
the
first
infant
school
properly
so
called
which
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
all
the
arrangements
and
the
apparent
success
of
them
the
children
of
whom
we
saw
about
a
hundred
boys
and
girls
were
between
eighteen
months
and
six
years
the
apartment
was
filled
with
all
sorts
of
instructive
and
amusing
objects
a
set
of
dutch
toys
arranged
as
a
cabinet
of
natural
history
was
excellent
a
numerous
collection
of
large
wooden
bricks
filled
one
corner
of
the
room
the
walls
were
hung
with
gay
papers
of
different
patterns
each
representing
some
pretty
group
of
figures
large
and
excellent
coloured
engravings
of
birds
and
beasts
were
exhibited
in
succession
as
the
theme
of
a
little
lesson
and
the
sweet
flute
of
ibbertson
gave
tune
and
time
to
the
prettiest
little
concert
of
chirping
birds
that
i
ever
listened
to
a
geographical
model
large
enough
to
give
clear
ideas
of
continent
island
cape
isthmus
et
cetera
all
set
in
water
is
placed
before
the
children
and
the
pretty
creatures
point
their
little
rosy
fingers
with
a
look
of
intense
interest
as
they
are
called
upon
to
shew
where
each
of
them
is
to
be
found
the
dress
both
of
boys
and
girls
was
elegantly
neat
and
their
manner
when
called
upon
to
speak
individually
was
intelligent
and
totally
free
from
the
rude
indifference
which
is
so
remarkably
prevalent
in
the
manners
of
american
children
ibbertson
will
be
benefactor
to
the
union
if
he
become
the
means
of
spreading
the
admirable
method
by
which
he
had
polished
the
manner
and
awakened
the
intellect
of
these
beautiful
little
republicans
i
have
conversed
with
many
american
ladies
on
the
total
want
of
discipline
and
subjection
which
i
observed
universally
among
children
of
all
ages
and
i
never
found
any
who
did
not
both
acknowledge
and
deplore
the
truth
of
the
remark
in
the
state
of
ohio
they
have
a
law
i
know
not
if
it
exist
elsewhere
that
if
a
father
strike
his
son
he
shall
pay
a
fine
of
ten
dollars
for
every
such
offence
i
was
told
by
a
gentleman
of
cincinnati
that
he
had
seen
this
fine
inflicted
there
at
the
requisition
of
a
boy
of
twelve
years
of
age
whose
father
he
proved
had
struck
him
for
lying
such
a
law
they
say
generates
a
spirit
of
freedom
what
else
may
it
generate
ibbertson
who
seems
perfectly
devoted
heart
and
head
to
the
subject
told
me
that
he
was
employed
in
organizing
successive
schools
that
should
receive
the
pupils
as
they
advanced
in
age
if
he
prove
himself
as
capable
of
completing
education
as
he
appears
to
be
of
beginning
it
his
institution
will
be
a
very
valuable
one
it
would
indeed
be
valuable
any
where
but
in
america
where
discipline
is
not
where
from
the
shell
they
are
beings
that
can
not
rule
nor
ever
will
be
ruled
it
is
invaluable
about
two
miles
from
baltimore
is
a
fort
nobly
situated
on
the
patapsco
and
commanding
the
approach
from
the
chesapeak
bay
as
our
visit
was
on
a
sunday
we
were
not
permitted
to
enter
it
the
walk
to
this
fort
is
along
a
fine
terrace
of
beautiful
verdure
which
commands
a
magnificent
view
of
the
city
with
its
columns
towers
domes
and
shipping
and
also
of
the
patapsco
river
which
is
here
so
wide
as
to
present
almost
a
sea
view
this
terrace
is
ornamented
with
abundance
of
evergreens
and
wild
roses
innumerable
but
the
whole
region
has
the
reputation
of
being
unhealthy
and
the
fort
itself
most
lamentably
so
before
leaving
the
city
of
monuments
i
must
not
omit
naming
one
reared
to
the
growing
wealth
of
the
country
barham
hotel
is
said
to
be
the
most
splendid
in
the
union
and
it
is
certainly
splendid
enough
for
a
people
more
luxurious
than
the
citizens
of
the
republic
appear
yet
to
be
i
heard
different
and
indeed
perfectly
contradictory
accounts
of
the
success
of
the
experiment
but
at
least
every
one
seemed
to
agree
that
the
liberal
projector
was
fully
entitled
to
exclaim
is
not
in
mortals
to
command
success
i
have
done
more
jonathan
i
deserved
it
after
enjoying
a
very
pleasant
fortnight
the
greater
part
of
which
was
passed
in
rambling
about
this
pretty
city
and
its
environs
we
left
it
not
without
regret
and
all
indulging
the
hope
that
we
should
be
able
to
pay
it
another
visit
chapter
voyage
to
washington
capitol
city
of
washington
congress
indians
funeral
of
a
member
of
congress
by
far
the
shortest
route
to
washington
both
as
to
distance
and
time
is
by
land
but
i
much
wished
to
see
the
celebrated
chesapeak
bay
and
it
was
therefore
decided
that
we
should
take
our
passage
in
the
it
is
indeed
a
beautiful
little
voyage
and
well
worth
the
time
it
costs
but
as
to
the
beauty
of
the
bay
it
must
i
think
be
felt
only
by
sailors
it
is
i
doubt
not
a
fine
shelter
for
ships
from
the
storms
of
the
atlantic
but
its
very
vastness
prevents
its
striking
the
eye
as
beautiful
it
is
in
fact
only
a
fine
sea
view
but
the
entrance
from
it
into
the
potomac
river
is
very
noble
and
is
one
of
the
points
at
which
one
feels
conscious
of
the
gigantic
proportions
of
the
country
without
having
recourse
to
a
graduated
the
passage
up
this
river
to
washington
is
interesting
from
many
objects
that
it
passes
but
beyond
all
else
by
the
view
it
affords
of
mount
vernon
the
seat
of
general
washington
it
is
there
that
this
truly
great
man
passed
the
last
years
of
his
virtuous
life
and
it
is
there
that
he
lies
buried
it
was
easy
to
distinguish
as
we
passed
the
cypress
that
waves
over
his
grave
the
latter
part
of
the
voyage
shews
some
fine
river
scenery
but
i
did
not
discover
this
till
some
months
afterwards
for
we
now
arrived
late
at
night
our
first
object
the
next
morning
was
to
get
a
sight
of
the
capitol
and
our
impatience
sent
us
forth
before
breakfast
the
mists
of
morning
still
hung
around
this
magnificent
building
when
first
it
broke
upon
our
view
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
effect
produced
was
not
the
greater
for
this
circumstance
at
all
events
we
were
struck
with
admiration
and
surprise
none
of
us
i
believe
expected
to
see
so
imposing
a
structure
on
that
side
of
the
atlantic
i
am
ill
at
describing
buildings
but
the
beauty
and
majesty
of
the
american
capitol
might
defy
an
abler
pen
than
mine
to
do
it
justice
it
stands
so
finely
too
high
and
alone
the
magnificent
western
facade
is
approached
from
the
city
by
terraces
and
steps
of
bolder
proportions
than
i
ever
before
saw
the
elegant
eastern
front
to
which
many
persons
give
the
preference
is
on
a
level
with
a
but
exceedingly
handsome
inclosure
which
in
a
few
years
will
offer
the
shade
of
all
the
most
splendid
trees
which
flourish
in
the
union
to
cool
the
brows
and
refresh
the
spirits
of
the
members
the
view
from
the
capitol
commands
the
city
and
many
miles
around
and
it
is
itself
an
object
of
imposing
beauty
to
the
whole
country
adjoining
we
were
again
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
very
agreeable
family
to
board
with
and
soon
after
breakfast
left
our
comfortless
hotel
near
the
water
for
very
pleasant
apartments
in
street
the
streets
that
intersect
the
great
avenues
in
washington
are
distinguished
by
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
i
was
delighted
with
the
whole
aspect
of
washington
light
cheerful
and
airy
it
reminded
me
of
our
fashionable
watering
places
it
has
been
laughed
at
by
foreigners
and
even
by
natives
because
the
original
plan
of
the
city
was
upon
an
enormous
scale
and
but
a
very
small
part
of
it
has
been
as
yet
executed
but
i
confess
i
see
nothing
in
the
least
degree
ridiculous
about
it
the
original
design
which
was
as
beautiful
as
it
was
extensive
has
been
in
no
way
departed
from
and
all
that
has
been
done
has
been
done
well
from
the
base
of
the
hill
on
which
the
capitol
stands
extends
a
street
of
most
magnificent
width
planted
on
each
side
with
trees
and
ornamented
by
many
splendid
shops
this
street
which
is
called
pennsylvania
avenue
is
above
a
mile
in
length
and
at
the
end
of
it
is
the
handsome
mansion
of
the
president
conveniently
near
to
his
residence
are
the
various
public
offices
all
handsome
simple
and
commodious
ample
areas
are
left
round
each
where
grass
and
shrubs
refresh
the
eye
in
another
of
the
principal
streets
is
the
general
and
not
far
from
it
a
very
noble
hall
towards
the
quarter
of
the
president
house
are
several
handsome
dwellings
which
are
chiefly
occupied
by
the
foreign
ministers
the
houses
in
the
other
parts
of
the
city
are
scattered
but
without
ever
losing
sight
of
the
regularity
of
the
original
plan
and
to
a
person
who
has
been
travelling
much
through
the
country
and
marked
the
immense
quantity
of
new
manufactories
new
canals
new
railroads
new
towns
and
new
cities
which
are
springing
as
it
were
from
the
earth
in
every
part
of
it
the
appearance
of
the
metropolis
rising
gradually
into
life
and
splendour
is
a
spectacle
of
high
historic
interest
commerce
had
already
produced
large
and
handsome
cities
in
america
before
she
had
attained
to
an
individual
political
existence
and
washington
may
be
scorned
as
a
metropolis
where
such
cities
as
philadelphia
and
new
york
exist
but
i
considered
it
as
the
growing
metropolis
of
the
growing
population
of
the
union
and
it
already
possesses
features
noble
enough
to
sustain
its
dignity
as
such
the
residence
of
the
foreign
legations
and
their
families
gives
a
tone
to
the
society
of
this
city
which
distinguishes
it
greatly
from
all
others
it
is
also
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
the
residence
of
the
senators
and
representatives
who
must
be
presumed
to
be
the
of
the
entire
body
of
citizens
both
in
respect
to
talent
and
education
this
can
not
fail
to
make
washington
a
more
agreeable
abode
than
any
other
city
in
the
union
the
total
absence
of
all
sights
sounds
or
smells
of
commerce
adds
greatly
to
the
charm
instead
of
drays
you
see
handsome
carriages
and
instead
of
the
busy
bustling
hustle
of
men
shuffling
on
to
a
sale
of
dry
goods
or
prime
broad
stuffs
you
see
very
personages
lounging
leisurely
up
and
down
pennsylvania
avenue
pishey
thompson
the
english
bookseller
with
his
pretty
collection
of
all
sorts
of
pretty
literature
fresh
from
london
and
somebody
the
jeweller
with
his
brilliant
shop
full
of
trinkets
are
the
principal
points
of
attraction
and
business
what
a
contrast
to
all
other
american
cities
the
members
who
pass
several
months
every
year
in
this
lounging
easy
way
with
no
labour
but
a
little
talking
and
with
the
of
eight
dollars
a
day
to
pay
them
for
it
must
feel
the
change
sadly
when
their
term
of
public
service
is
over
there
is
another
circumstance
which
renders
the
evening
parties
at
washington
extremely
unlike
those
of
other
places
in
the
union
this
is
the
great
majority
of
gentlemen
the
expense
the
trouble
or
the
necessity
of
a
ruling
eye
at
home
one
or
all
of
these
reasons
prevents
the
members
ladies
from
accompanying
them
to
washington
at
least
i
heard
of
very
few
who
had
their
wives
with
them
the
female
society
is
chiefly
to
be
found
among
the
families
of
the
foreign
ministers
those
of
the
officers
of
state
and
of
the
few
members
the
wealthiest
and
most
aristocratic
of
the
land
who
bring
their
families
with
them
some
few
independent
persons
reside
in
or
near
the
city
but
this
is
a
class
so
thinly
scattered
that
they
can
hardly
be
accounted
a
part
of
the
population
but
strange
to
say
even
here
a
theatre
can
not
be
supported
for
more
than
a
few
weeks
at
a
time
i
was
told
that
gambling
is
the
favourite
recreation
of
the
gentlemen
and
that
it
is
carried
to
a
very
considerable
extent
but
here
as
elsewhere
within
the
country
it
is
kept
extremely
well
out
of
sight
i
do
not
think
i
was
present
with
a
pack
of
cards
a
dozen
times
during
more
than
three
years
that
i
remained
in
the
country
billiards
are
much
played
though
in
most
places
the
amusement
is
illegal
it
often
appeared
to
me
that
the
old
women
of
a
state
made
the
laws
and
the
young
men
broke
them
notwithstanding
the
diminutive
size
of
the
city
we
found
much
to
see
and
to
amuse
us
the
patent
office
is
a
curious
record
of
the
fertility
of
the
mind
of
man
when
left
to
its
own
resources
but
it
gives
ample
proof
also
that
it
is
not
under
such
circumstances
it
is
most
usefully
employed
this
patent
office
contains
models
of
all
the
mechanical
inventions
that
have
been
produced
in
the
union
and
the
number
is
enormous
i
asked
the
man
who
shewed
these
what
proportion
of
them
had
been
brought
into
use
he
said
about
one
in
a
thousand
he
told
me
also
that
they
chiefly
proceeded
from
mechanics
and
agriculturists
settled
in
remote
parts
of
the
country
who
had
began
by
endeavouring
to
hit
upon
some
contrivance
to
enable
them
to
without
sending
some
thousand
and
odd
miles
for
the
thing
they
wanted
if
the
contrivance
succeeded
they
generally
became
so
fond
of
this
offspring
of
their
ingenuity
that
they
brought
it
to
washington
for
a
patent
at
the
secretary
of
state
office
we
were
shewn
autographs
of
all
the
potentates
with
whom
the
union
were
in
alliance
which
i
believe
pretty
well
includes
all
to
the
parchments
bearing
these
royal
signs
manual
were
appended
of
course
the
official
seals
of
each
enclosed
in
gold
or
silver
boxes
of
handsome
workmanship
i
was
amused
by
the
manner
in
which
one
of
their
own
just
prepared
for
the
court
of
russia
was
displayed
to
us
and
the
superiority
of
their
decorations
pointed
out
they
were
superior
and
in
much
better
taste
than
the
rest
and
i
only
wish
that
the
feeling
that
induced
this
display
would
spread
to
every
corner
of
the
union
and
mix
itself
with
every
act
and
with
every
sentiment
let
america
give
a
fair
portion
other
attention
to
the
arts
and
the
graces
that
embellish
life
and
i
will
make
her
another
visit
and
write
another
book
as
unlike
this
as
possible
among
the
royal
signatures
the
only
ones
which
much
interested
me
were
two
from
the
hand
of
napoleon
the
earliest
of
these
when
he
was
first
consul
was
a
most
illegible
scrawl
and
as
the
tradition
went
was
written
on
horseback
but
his
writing
improved
greatly
after
he
became
an
emperor
the
subsequent
signature
being
firmly
and
clearly
i
longed
to
steal
both
the
purity
of
the
american
character
formed
and
founded
on
the
purity
of
the
american
government
was
made
evident
to
our
senses
by
the
display
of
all
the
offerings
of
esteem
and
regard
which
had
been
presented
by
various
sovereigns
to
the
different
american
ministers
who
had
been
sent
to
their
courts
the
object
of
the
law
which
exacted
this
deposit
from
every
individual
so
honoured
was
they
told
us
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
bribery
being
used
to
corrupt
any
envoy
of
the
republic
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
better
way
to
select
for
the
office
such
men
as
they
felt
could
not
be
seduced
by
a
sword
or
a
but
they
doubtless
know
their
own
business
best
the
bureau
for
indian
affairs
contains
a
room
of
great
interest
the
walls
are
entirely
covered
with
original
portraits
of
all
the
chiefs
who
from
time
to
time
have
come
to
negotiate
with
their
great
father
as
they
call
the
president
these
portraits
are
by
king
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
are
excellent
likenesses
as
are
all
the
portraits
i
have
ever
seen
from
the
hands
of
that
gentleman
the
countenances
are
full
of
expression
but
the
expression
in
most
of
them
is
extremely
similar
or
rather
i
should
say
that
they
have
but
two
sorts
of
expression
the
one
is
that
of
very
noble
and
warlike
daring
the
other
of
a
gentle
and
naive
simplicity
that
has
no
mixture
of
folly
in
it
but
which
is
inexpressibly
engaging
and
the
more
touching
perhaps
because
at
the
moment
we
were
looking
at
them
those
very
hearts
which
lent
the
eyes
such
meek
and
friendly
softness
were
wrung
by
a
base
cruel
and
most
oppressive
act
of
their
we
were
at
washington
at
the
time
that
the
measure
for
chasing
the
last
of
several
tribes
of
indians
from
their
forest
homes
was
canvassed
in
congress
and
finally
decided
upon
by
the
fiat
of
the
president
if
the
american
character
may
be
judged
by
their
conduct
in
this
matter
they
are
most
lamentably
deficient
in
every
feeling
of
honour
and
integrity
it
is
among
themselves
and
from
themselves
that
i
have
heard
the
statements
which
represent
them
as
treacherous
and
false
almost
beyond
belief
in
their
intercourse
with
the
unhappy
indians
had
i
during
my
residence
in
the
united
states
observed
any
single
feature
in
their
national
character
that
could
justify
their
eternal
boast
of
liberality
and
the
love
of
freedom
i
might
have
respected
them
however
much
my
taste
might
have
been
offended
by
what
was
peculiar
in
their
manners
and
customs
but
it
is
impossible
for
any
mind
of
common
honesty
not
to
be
revolted
by
the
contradictions
in
their
principles
and
practice
they
inveigh
against
the
governments
of
europe
because
as
they
say
they
favour
the
powerful
and
oppress
the
weak
you
may
hear
this
declaimed
upon
in
congress
roared
out
in
taverns
discussed
in
every
satirized
upon
the
stage
nay
even
anathematized
from
the
pulpit
listen
to
it
and
then
look
at
them
at
home
you
will
see
them
with
one
hand
hoisting
the
cap
of
liberty
and
with
the
other
flogging
their
slaves
you
will
see
them
one
hour
lecturing
their
mob
on
the
indefeasible
rights
of
man
and
the
next
driving
from
their
homes
the
children
of
the
soil
whom
they
have
bound
themselves
to
protect
by
the
most
solemn
treaties
in
justice
to
those
who
approve
not
this
treacherous
policy
i
will
quote
a
paragraph
from
a
new
york
paper
which
shews
that
there
are
some
among
them
who
look
with
detestation
on
the
bold
bad
measure
decided
upon
at
washington
in
the
year
we
know
of
no
subject
at
the
present
moment
of
more
importance
to
the
character
of
our
country
for
justice
and
integrity
than
that
which
relates
to
the
indian
tribes
in
georgia
and
alabama
and
particularly
the
cherokees
in
the
former
state
the
act
passed
by
congress
just
at
the
end
of
the
session
with
the
tyrannical
and
iniquitous
statute
of
georgia
strikes
a
formidable
blow
at
the
reputation
of
the
united
states
in
respect
to
their
faith
pledged
in
almost
innumerable
instances
in
the
most
solemn
treaties
and
compacts
there
were
many
objects
of
much
interest
shewn
us
at
this
indian
bureau
but
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
most
unhappy
and
people
it
was
a
very
painful
interest
the
dresses
worn
by
the
chiefs
when
their
portraits
were
taken
are
many
of
them
splendid
from
the
embroidery
of
beads
and
other
ornaments
and
the
room
contains
many
specimens
of
their
ingenuity
and
even
of
their
taste
there
is
a
glass
case
in
the
room
wherein
are
arranged
specimens
of
worked
muslin
and
other
needlework
some
very
excellent
handwriting
and
many
other
little
productions
of
male
and
female
indians
all
proving
clearly
that
they
are
perfectly
capable
of
civilization
indeed
the
circumstance
which
renders
their
expulsion
from
their
own
their
native
lands
so
peculiarly
lamentable
is
that
they
were
yielding
rapidly
to
the
force
of
example
their
lives
were
no
longer
those
of
wandering
hunters
but
they
were
becoming
agriculturists
and
the
tyrannical
arm
of
brutal
power
has
not
now
driven
them
as
formerly
only
from
their
hunting
grounds
their
favourite
springs
and
the
sacred
bones
of
their
fathers
but
it
has
chased
them
from
the
dwellings
their
advancing
knowledge
had
taught
them
to
make
comfortable
from
the
fields
of
their
pride
and
from
the
crops
their
sweat
had
watered
and
for
what
to
add
some
thousand
acres
of
territory
to
the
wilderness
which
borders
them
the
potomac
on
arriving
at
washington
makes
a
beautiful
sweep
which
forms
a
sort
of
bay
round
which
the
city
is
built
just
where
it
makes
the
turn
a
wooden
bridge
is
thrown
across
connecting
the
shores
of
maryland
and
virginia
this
bridge
is
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
length
and
is
ugly
enough
it
has
since
been
washed
away
by
the
breaking
up
of
the
frost
of
february
the
and
arsenal
are
just
above
it
on
the
maryland
side
and
make
a
handsome
appearance
on
the
edge
of
the
river
following
the
sweep
above
mentioned
near
the
arsenal
much
too
near
is
the
penitentiary
which
as
it
was
just
finished
and
not
inhabited
we
examined
in
every
part
it
is
built
for
the
purpose
of
solitary
confinement
for
life
a
gallows
is
a
much
less
spectacle
than
one
of
these
awful
cells
and
assuredly
when
imprisonment
therein
for
life
is
substituted
for
death
it
is
no
mercy
to
the
criminal
but
if
it
be
a
greater
terror
to
the
citizen
it
may
answer
the
purpose
better
i
do
not
conceive
that
out
of
a
hundred
human
beings
who
had
been
thus
confined
for
a
year
one
would
be
found
at
the
end
of
it
who
would
continue
to
linger
on
there
it
was
for
if
the
alternative
of
being
hanged
were
offered
to
them
i
had
written
a
description
of
these
horrible
cells
but
captain
hall
picture
of
a
similar
building
is
so
accurate
and
so
clear
that
it
is
needless
to
insert
it
still
following
the
sweep
of
the
river
at
the
distance
of
two
miles
from
washington
is
george
town
formerly
a
place
of
considerable
commercial
importance
and
likely
i
think
to
become
so
again
when
the
ohio
and
chesapeake
canals
which
there
mouths
into
the
potomac
shall
be
in
full
action
it
is
a
very
pretty
town
commanding
a
lovely
view
of
which
the
noble
potomac
and
the
almost
nobler
capitol
are
the
great
features
the
country
rises
into
a
beautiful
line
of
hills
behind
washington
which
form
a
sort
of
undulating
terrace
on
to
george
town
this
terrace
is
almost
entirely
occupied
by
a
succession
of
gentlemen
seats
at
george
town
the
potomac
suddenly
contracts
itself
and
begins
to
assume
that
rapid
rocky
and
irregular
character
which
marks
it
afterwards
and
renders
its
course
till
it
meets
the
shenandoah
at
harper
ferry
a
series
of
the
most
wild
and
romantic
views
that
are
to
be
found
in
america
attending
the
debates
in
congress
was
of
course
one
of
our
great
objects
and
as
an
english
woman
i
was
perhaps
the
more
eager
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
allowed
it
was
repeatedly
observed
to
me
that
at
least
in
this
instance
i
must
acknowledge
the
superior
gallantry
of
the
americans
and
that
they
herein
give
a
decided
proof
of
surpassing
the
english
in
a
wish
to
honour
the
ladies
as
they
have
a
gallery
in
the
house
of
representatives
erected
expressly
for
them
while
in
england
they
are
rigorously
excluded
from
every
part
of
the
house
of
commons
but
the
inference
i
draw
from
this
is
precisely
the
reverse
of
the
suggested
it
is
well
known
that
the
reason
why
the
house
of
commons
was
closed
against
ladies
was
that
their
presence
was
found
too
attractive
and
that
so
many
members
were
tempted
to
neglect
the
business
before
the
house
that
they
might
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
the
fair
critics
in
the
galleries
that
it
became
a
matter
of
national
importance
to
banish
them
and
they
were
banished
it
will
be
long
ere
the
american
legislature
will
find
it
necessary
to
pass
the
same
law
for
the
same
reason
a
lady
of
washington
however
told
me
an
anecdote
which
went
far
to
shew
that
a
more
intellectual
turn
in
the
women
would
produce
a
change
in
the
manners
of
the
men
she
told
me
that
when
the
miss
wrights
were
in
washington
with
general
lafayette
they
very
frequently
attended
the
debates
and
that
the
most
distinguished
members
were
always
crowding
round
them
for
this
unwonted
gallantry
they
apologized
to
their
beautiful
countrywomen
by
saying
that
if
they
took
equal
interest
in
the
debates
the
galleries
would
be
always
thronged
by
the
members
the
privilege
of
attending
these
debates
would
be
more
valuable
could
the
speakers
be
better
heard
from
the
gallery
but
with
the
most
earnest
attention
i
could
only
follow
one
or
two
of
the
orators
whose
voices
were
peculiarly
loud
and
clear
this
made
it
really
a
labour
to
listen
but
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
chamber
was
of
itself
a
reason
for
going
again
and
again
it
was
however
really
mortifying
to
see
this
splendid
hall
fitted
up
in
so
stately
and
sumptuous
a
manner
filled
with
men
sitting
in
the
most
unseemly
attitudes
a
large
majority
with
their
hats
on
and
nearly
all
spitting
to
an
excess
that
decency
forbids
me
to
describe
among
the
crowd
who
must
be
included
in
this
description
a
few
were
distinguished
by
not
wearing
their
hats
and
by
sitting
on
their
chairs
like
other
human
beings
without
throwing
their
legs
above
their
heads
whenever
i
enquired
the
name
of
one
of
these
exceptions
i
was
told
that
it
was
mr
this
or
that
one
day
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
get
placed
on
the
sofas
between
the
pillars
on
the
floor
of
the
house
the
galleries
being
shut
up
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
alterations
which
it
was
hoped
might
improve
the
hearing
in
that
part
of
the
house
occupied
by
the
members
and
which
is
universally
complained
of
as
being
very
defective
but
in
our
places
on
the
sofas
we
found
we
heard
very
much
better
than
up
stairs
and
well
enough
to
be
extremely
amused
by
the
rude
eloquence
of
a
thorough
horse
and
alligator
orator
from
kentucky
who
entreated
the
house
repeatedly
to
go
the
whole
hog
as
a
proof
of
this
defective
hearing
in
the
hall
of
congress
i
may
quote
a
passage
from
a
newspaper
report
of
a
debate
on
improvements
it
was
proposed
to
suspend
a
ceiling
of
glass
fifteen
feet
above
the
heads
of
the
members
a
member
speaking
in
favour
of
this
proposal
said
members
would
then
at
least
be
able
to
understand
what
was
the
question
before
the
house
an
advantage
which
most
of
them
did
not
now
possess
respecting
more
than
half
the
propositions
upon
which
they
voted
if
i
mistake
not
every
debate
i
listened
to
in
the
american
congress
was
upon
one
and
the
same
subject
namely
the
entire
independence
of
each
individual
state
with
regard
to
the
federal
government
the
jealousy
on
this
point
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
very
strangest
political
feeling
that
ever
got
possession
of
the
mind
of
man
i
do
not
pretend
to
judge
the
merits
of
this
question
i
speak
solely
of
the
very
singular
effect
of
seeing
man
after
man
start
eagerly
to
his
feet
to
declare
that
the
greatest
injury
the
basest
injustice
the
most
obnoxious
tyranny
that
could
be
practised
against
the
state
of
which
he
was
a
member
would
be
a
vote
of
a
few
million
dollars
for
the
purpose
of
making
their
roads
or
canals
or
for
drainage
or
in
short
for
any
purpose
of
improvement
whatsoever
during
the
month
we
were
at
washington
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
conversation
respecting
a
recent
exclusion
from
congress
of
a
gentleman
who
by
every
account
was
one
of
the
most
esteemed
men
in
the
house
and
i
think
the
father
of
it
the
crime
for
which
this
gentleman
was
by
his
own
particular
friends
and
admirers
was
that
he
had
given
his
vote
for
a
grant
of
public
money
for
the
purpose
of
draining
a
most
lamentable
and
unhealthy
district
called
dismal
swamp
one
great
boast
of
the
country
is
that
they
have
no
national
debt
or
that
they
shall
have
none
in
two
years
this
seems
not
very
wonderful
considering
their
productive
tariff
and
that
the
income
paid
to
their
president
is
per
other
government
salaries
being
in
proportion
and
all
internal
improvements
at
the
expense
of
the
government
treasury
being
voted
unconstitutional
the
is
like
the
hall
of
congress
a
semicircle
but
of
very
much
smaller
dimensions
it
is
most
elegantly
fitted
up
and
what
is
better
still
the
senators
generally
speaking
look
like
gentlemen
they
do
not
wear
their
hats
and
the
activity
of
youth
being
happily
past
they
do
not
toss
their
heels
above
their
heads
i
would
i
could
add
they
do
not
spit
but
alas
i
have
an
oath
in
heaven
and
may
not
write
an
untruth
a
very
handsome
room
opening
on
a
noble
stone
balcony
is
fitted
up
as
a
library
for
the
members
the
collection
as
far
as
a
very
cursory
view
could
enable
me
to
judge
was
very
like
that
of
a
private
english
gentleman
but
with
less
latin
greek
and
italian
this
room
also
is
elegantly
furnished
rich
brussels
carpet
library
tables
with
portfolios
of
engravings
abundance
of
sofas
and
so
on
the
view
from
it
is
glorious
and
it
looks
like
the
abode
of
luxury
and
taste
i
can
by
no
means
attempt
to
describe
all
the
apartments
of
this
immense
building
but
the
magnificent
rotunda
in
the
centre
must
not
be
left
unnoticed
it
is
indeed
a
noble
hall
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
and
of
an
imposing
loftiness
lighted
by
an
ample
dome
almost
any
pictures
excepting
the
cartoons
would
look
paltry
in
this
room
from
the
immense
height
of
the
walls
but
the
subjects
of
the
four
pictures
which
are
placed
there
are
of
such
high
historic
interest
that
they
should
certainly
have
a
place
somewhere
as
national
records
one
represents
the
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
another
the
resignation
of
the
presidency
by
the
great
washington
another
the
celebrated
victory
of
general
gates
at
saratoga
and
the
fourth
do
not
well
remember
but
i
think
it
is
some
other
martial
scene
commemorating
a
victory
i
rather
think
that
of
york
town
one
other
object
in
the
capitol
must
be
mentioned
though
it
occurs
in
so
obscure
a
part
of
the
building
that
one
or
two
members
to
whom
i
mentioned
it
were
not
aware
of
its
existence
the
lower
part
of
the
edifice
a
story
below
the
rotunda
has
a
variety
of
committee
rooms
courts
and
other
places
of
business
in
a
hall
leading
to
some
of
these
rooms
the
ceiling
is
supported
by
pillars
the
capitals
of
which
struck
me
as
peculiarly
beautiful
they
are
composed
of
the
ears
and
leaves
of
the
indian
corn
beautifully
arranged
and
forming
as
graceful
an
outline
as
the
acanthus
itself
this
was
the
only
instance
i
saw
in
which
america
has
ventured
to
attempt
national
originality
the
success
is
perfect
a
sense
of
fitness
always
enhances
the
effect
of
beauty
i
will
not
attempt
a
long
essay
on
the
subject
but
if
america
in
her
vastness
her
immense
natural
resources
and
her
remote
grandeur
would
be
less
imitative
she
would
be
infinitely
more
picturesque
and
interesting
the
president
has
regular
evening
parties
every
other
wednesday
which
are
called
his
the
last
syllable
is
pronounced
by
every
one
as
long
as
possible
being
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
french
and
english
manner
of
pronouncing
the
same
word
the
effect
of
this
from
the
very
frequent
repetition
of
the
word
in
all
companies
is
very
droll
and
for
a
long
time
i
thought
people
were
quizzing
these
public
days
the
reception
rooms
are
handsome
particularly
the
grand
saloon
which
is
elegantly
nay
splendidly
furnished
this
has
been
done
since
the
visit
of
captain
hall
whose
remarks
upon
the
former
state
of
this
room
may
have
hastened
its
decoration
but
there
are
a
few
anomalies
in
some
parts
of
the
entertainment
which
are
not
very
courtly
the
company
are
about
as
select
as
that
of
an
ball
at
the
the
churches
at
washington
are
not
superb
but
the
episcopalian
and
catholic
were
filled
with
elegantly
dressed
women
i
observed
a
greater
proportion
of
gentlemen
at
church
at
washington
than
any
where
else
the
presbyterian
ladies
go
to
church
three
times
in
the
day
but
the
general
appearance
of
washington
on
a
sunday
is
much
less
puritanical
than
that
of
most
other
american
towns
the
people
walk
about
and
there
are
no
chains
in
the
streets
as
at
philadelphia
to
prevent
their
riding
or
driving
if
they
like
it
the
ladies
dress
well
but
not
so
splendidly
as
at
baltimore
i
remarked
that
it
was
not
very
unusual
at
washington
for
a
lady
to
take
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
who
was
neither
her
husband
her
father
nor
her
brother
this
remarkable
relaxation
of
american
decorum
has
been
probably
introduced
by
the
foreign
legations
at
about
a
mile
from
the
town
on
the
high
terrace
ground
above
described
is
a
very
pretty
place
to
which
the
proprietor
has
given
the
name
kaleirama
it
is
not
large
or
in
any
way
magnificent
but
the
view
from
it
is
charming
and
it
has
a
little
wood
behind
covering
about
two
hundred
acres
of
broken
ground
that
slopes
down
to
a
dark
cold
little
river
so
closely
shut
in
by
rocks
and
evergreens
that
it
might
serve
as
a
bath
for
diana
and
her
nymphs
the
whole
of
this
wood
is
filled
with
wild
flowers
but
such
as
we
cherish
fondly
in
our
gardens
a
ferry
at
george
town
crosses
the
potomac
and
about
two
miles
from
it
on
the
virginian
side
is
arlington
the
seat
of
custis
who
is
the
grandson
of
general
washington
wife
it
is
a
noble
looking
place
having
a
portico
of
stately
white
columns
which
as
the
mansion
stands
high
with
a
background
of
dark
woods
forms
a
beautiful
object
in
the
landscape
at
george
town
is
a
nunnery
where
many
young
ladies
are
educated
and
at
a
little
distance
from
it
a
college
of
jesuits
for
the
education
of
young
men
where
as
their
advertisements
state
the
humanities
are
taught
we
attended
mass
at
the
chapel
of
the
nunnery
where
the
female
voices
that
performed
the
chant
were
very
pleasing
the
shadowy
form
of
the
veiled
abbess
in
her
little
sacred
parlour
seen
through
a
grating
and
a
black
curtain
but
rendered
clearly
visible
by
the
light
of
a
gothic
window
behind
her
drew
a
good
deal
of
our
attention
every
act
of
genuflection
even
the
telling
her
beads
was
discernible
but
so
mistily
that
it
gave
her
indeed
the
appearance
of
a
being
who
had
already
quitted
this
life
and
was
hovering
on
the
confines
of
the
world
of
shadows
the
convent
has
a
considerable
inclosure
attached
to
it
where
i
frequently
saw
from
the
heights
above
it
dark
figures
in
awfully
thick
black
veils
walking
solemnly
up
and
down
the
american
lady
who
was
the
subject
of
one
of
prince
hohenlohe
celebrated
miracles
was
pointed
out
to
us
at
washington
all
the
world
declare
that
her
recovery
was
marvellous
there
appeared
to
be
a
great
many
foreigners
at
washington
particularly
french
in
paris
i
have
often
observed
that
it
was
a
sort
of
fashion
to
speak
of
america
as
a
new
utopia
especially
among
the
young
liberals
who
before
the
happy
accession
of
philip
fancied
that
a
country
without
a
king
was
the
land
of
promise
but
i
sometimes
thought
that
like
many
other
fine
things
it
lost
part
of
its
brilliance
when
examined
too
nearly
i
overheard
the
following
question
and
answer
pass
between
two
young
frenchmen
who
appeared
to
have
met
for
the
first
time
eh
bien
monsieur
comment
la
liberte
et
mises
en
action
mais
monsieur
je
vous
avoue
que
ie
beau
ideal
que
nous
autres
nous
avons
concu
de
tout
cela
a
paris
avait
quelque
chose
de
plus
poetique
que
ce
que
nous
trouvons
ici
on
another
occasion
i
was
excessively
amused
by
the
tone
in
which
one
of
these
young
men
replied
to
a
question
put
to
him
by
another
frenchman
a
pretty
looking
woman
but
exceedingly
deficient
in
was
standing
alone
at
a
little
distance
from
them
and
close
at
their
elbows
stood
a
very
awkward
looking
gentleman
qui
est
cette
dame
said
the
enquirer
monsieur
said
my
young
with
an
indescribable
grimace
la
femelle
de
ce
male
indicating
his
neighbour
by
an
expressive
curl
of
his
upper
lip
the
theatre
was
not
open
while
we
were
in
washington
but
we
afterwards
took
advantage
of
our
vicinity
to
the
city
to
visit
it
the
house
is
very
small
and
most
astonishingly
dirty
and
void
of
decoration
considering
that
it
is
the
only
place
of
public
amusement
that
the
city
affords
i
have
before
mentioned
the
want
of
decorum
at
the
cincinnati
theatre
but
certainly
that
of
the
capital
at
least
rivalled
it
in
the
freedom
of
action
and
attitude
a
freedom
which
seems
to
disdain
the
restraints
of
civilized
manners
one
man
in
the
pit
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
vomiting
which
appeared
not
in
the
least
to
annoy
or
surprise
his
neighbours
and
the
happy
coincidence
of
a
physician
being
at
that
moment
personated
on
the
stage
was
hailed
by
many
of
the
audience
as
an
excellent
joke
of
which
the
actor
took
advantage
and
elicited
shouts
of
applause
by
saying
i
expect
my
services
are
wanted
elsewhere
the
spitting
was
incessant
and
not
one
in
ten
of
the
male
part
of
the
illustrious
legislative
audiences
sat
according
to
the
usual
custom
of
human
beings
the
legs
were
thrown
sometimes
over
the
front
of
the
box
sometimes
over
the
side
of
it
here
and
there
a
senator
stretched
his
entire
length
along
a
bench
and
in
many
instances
the
front
rail
was
preferred
as
a
seat
i
remarked
one
young
man
whose
handsome
person
and
most
elaborate
toilet
led
me
to
conclude
he
was
a
personage
and
so
i
doubt
not
he
was
nevertheless
i
saw
him
take
from
the
pocket
of
his
silk
waistcoat
a
lump
of
tobacco
and
daintily
deposit
it
within
his
cheek
i
am
inclined
to
think
this
most
vile
and
universal
habit
of
chewing
tobacco
is
the
cause
of
a
remarkable
peculiarity
in
the
male
physiognomy
of
americans
their
lips
are
almost
uniformly
thin
and
compressed
at
first
i
accounted
for
this
upon
lavater
theory
and
attributed
it
to
the
arid
temperament
of
the
people
but
it
is
too
universal
to
be
explained
whereas
the
habit
above
mentioned
which
pervades
all
classes
excepting
the
literary
well
accounts
for
it
as
the
act
of
expressing
the
juices
of
this
loathsome
herb
enforces
exactly
that
position
of
the
lips
which
gives
this
remarkable
peculiarity
to
the
american
countenance
a
member
of
congress
died
while
we
were
at
washington
and
i
was
surprised
by
the
ceremony
and
dignity
of
his
funeral
it
seems
that
whenever
a
senator
or
member
of
congress
dies
during
the
session
he
is
buried
at
the
expense
of
the
government
the
ceremony
not
coming
under
the
head
of
internal
improvement
and
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
are
not
interfered
with
by
his
friends
but
become
matters
of
state
i
transcribed
the
order
of
the
procession
as
being
rather
grand
and
stately
chaplains
of
both
houses

the
procession
was
of
considerable
extent
but
not
on
foot
and
the
majority
of
the
carriages
were
hired
for
the
occasion
the
body
was
interred
in
an
open
grave
yard
near
the
city
i
did
not
see
the
monument
erected
on
this
occasion
but
i
presume
it
was
in
the
same
style
as
several
others
i
had
remarked
in
the
same
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
members
who
had
died
at
washington
these
were
square
blocks

pretension

chapter
stonington

the
greatest
pleasure
i
had
promised
myself
in
visiting
washington
was
the
seeing
a
very
old
friend
who
had
left
england
many
years
ago
and
married
in
america
she
was
now
a
widow
and
as
i
believed
settled
in
washington
i
soon
had
the
mortification
of
finding
that
she
was
not
in
the
city
but
ere
long
i
learnt
that
her
residence
was
not
more
than
ten
miles
from
it
we
speedily
met
and
it
was
settled
that
we
should
pass
the
summer
with
her
in
maryland
and
after
a
month
devoted
to
washington
we
left
it
for
stonington
we
arrived
there
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
kindness
of
our
reception
the
interest
we
felt
in
becoming
acquainted
with
the
family
of
my
friend
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
surrounding
country
and
the
lovely
season
altogether
made
our
stay
there
a
period
of
great
enjoyment
i
wonder
not
that
the
first
settlers
in
virginia
with
the
bold
captain
smith
of
chivalrous
memory
at
their
head
should
have
fought
so
stoutly
to
dispossess
the
valiant
father
of
pocohantas
of
his
fair
domain
for
i
certainly
never
saw
a
more
tempting
territory
stonington
is
about
two
miles
from
the
most
romantic
point
of
the
potomac
river
and
virginia
spreads
her
wild
but
beautiful
and
most
fertile
paradise
on
the
opposite
shore
the
maryland
side
partakes
of
the
same
character
and
perfectly
astonished
us
by
the
profusion
of
her
wild
fruits
and
flowers
we
had
not
been
long
within
reach
of
the
great
falls
of
the
potomac
before
a
party
was
made
for
us
to
visit
them
the
walk
from
stonington
to
these
falls
is
through
scenery
that
can
hardly
be
called
forest
park
or
garden
but
which
partakes
of
all
three
a
little
english
girl
accompanied
us
who
had
but
lately
left
her
home
she
exclaimed
oh
how
many
english
ladies
would
glory
in
such
a
garden
as
this
and
in
truth
they
might
cedars
planes
shumacs
junipers
and
oaks
of
various
kinds
most
of
them
new
to
us
shaded
our
path
wild
vines
with
their
rich
expansive
leaves
and
their
sweet
blossom
rivalling
the
mignionette
in
fragrance
clustered
round
their
branches
strawberries
in
full
bloom
violets
anemonies
and
wild
pinks
with
many
other
and
still
lovelier
flowers
which
my
ignorance
forbids
me
to
name
literally
covered
the
ground
the
arbor
judae
the
in
its
fullest
glory
of
flowers
azalias
and
wild
roses
dazzled
our
eyes
whichever
way
we
turned
them
it
was
the
most
flowery
two
miles
i
ever
walked
the
sound
of
the
falls
is
heard
at
stonington
and
the
gradual
increase
of
this
sound
is
one
of
the
agreeable
features
of
this
delicious
walk
i
know
not
why
the
rush
of
waters
is
so
delightful
to
the
ear
all
other
monotonous
sounds
are
wearying
and
harass
the
spirits
but
i
never
met
any
one
who
did
not
love
to
listen
to
a
waterfall
a
rapid
stream
called
the
branch
creek
was
to
be
crossed
ere
we
reached
the
spot
where
the
falls
are
first
visible
this
rumbling
turbid
angry
little
rivulet
flows
through
evergreens
and
flowering
underwood
and
is
crossed
plusieures
by
logs
thrown
from
rock
to
rock
the
thundering
noise
of
the
still
unseen
falls
suggests
an
idea
of
danger
while
crossing
these
rude
bridges
which
hardly
belongs
to
them
having
reached
the
other
side
of
the
creek
we
continued
under
the
shelter
of
the
evergreens
for
another
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
emerged
upon
a
sight
that
drew
a
shout
of
wonder
and
delight
from
us
all
the
rocky
depths
of
an
enormous
river
were
opened
before
our
eyes
and
so
huge
are
the
black
crags
that
inclose
it
that
the
thundering
torrents
of
water
rushing
through
over
and
among
the
rocks
of
this
awful
chasm
appear
lost
and
swallowed
up
in
it
the
river
or
rather
the
bed
of
it
is
here
of
great
width
and
most
frightful
depth
lined
on
all
sides
with
huge
masses
of
black
rock
of
every
imaginable
form
the
flood
that
roars
through
them
is
seen
only
at
intervals
here
in
a
full
heavy
sheet
of
green
transparent
water
falling
straight
and
unbroken
there
dashing
along
a
narrow
channel
with
a
violence
that
makes
one
dizzy
to
see
and
hear
in
one
place
an
unfathomed
pool
shows
a
mirror
of
inky
blackness
and
as
still
as
night
in
another
the
tortured
twisted
cataract
tumbles
headlong
in
a
dozen
different
torrents
half
hid
by
the
cloud
of
spray
they
send
high
into
the
air
despite
this
uproar
the
slenderest
loveliest
shrubs
peep
forth
from
among
these
hideous
rocks
like
children
smiling
in
the
midst
of
danger
as
we
stood
looking
at
this
tremendous
scene
one
of
our
friends
made
us
remark
that
the
poison
alder
and
the
poison
vine
threw
their
graceful
but
perfidious
branches
over
every
rock
and
assured
us
also
that
innumerable
tribes
of
snakes
found
their
dark
dwellings
among
them
to
call
this
scene
beautiful
would
be
a
strange
abuse
of
terms
for
it
is
altogether
composed
of
sights
and
sounds
of
terror
the
falls
of
the
potomac
are
awfully
sublime
the
dark
deep
gulf
which
yawns
before
you
the
foaming
roaring
cataract
the
eddying
whirlpool
and
the
giddy
precipice
all
seem
to
threaten
life
and
to
appal
the
senses
yet
it
was
a
great
delight
to
sit
upon
a
high
and
jutting
crag
and
look
and
listen
i
heard
with
pleasure
that
it
was
to
the
virginian
side
of
the
potomac
that
the
felicity
hunters
of
washington
resorted
to
see
this
fearful
wonder
for
i
never
saw
a
spot
where
i
should
less
have
liked
the
annoying
how
d
of
a
casual
rencontre
one
could
not
even
give
or
receive
the
exciting
is
it
not
charming
which
rousseau
talks
of
for
if
it
were
uttered
it
could
not
be
heard
or
if
heard
would
fall
most
earthly
dull
on
the
spirit
when
rapt
by
the
magic
of
such
a
scene
a
look
or
the
silent
pressure
of
the
arm
is
all
the
interchange
of
feeling
that
such
a
scene
allows
and
in
the
midst
of
my
terror
and
my
pleasure
i
wished
for
the
arm
and
the
eye
of
some
few
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
the
return
from
such
a
scene
is
more
soberly
silent
than
the
approach
to
it
but
the
cool
and
quiet
hour
the
mellowed
tints
of
some
gay
blossoms
and
the
closed
bells
of
others
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
insects
that
survive
the
day
and
the
moist
freshness
that
forbids
the
foot
to
weary
in
its
homeward
path
have
all
enjoyment
in
them
and
seem
to
harmonize
with
the
half
wearied
half
excited
state
of
spirits
that
such
an
excursion
is
sure
to
produce
and
then
the
entering
the
cool
and
moonlit
portico
the
sangaree
or
still
more
refreshing
coffee
that
waits
you
is
all
delightful
and
if
to
this
be
added
the
happiness
of
an
easy
sofa
and
a
friend
like
my
charming
s
to
soothe
you
with
an
hour
of
mozart
the
most
fastidious
european
might
allow
that
such
a
day
was
worth
waking
for
chapter
small
landed
proprietors
slavery
i
now
for
the
first
time
since
i
crossed
the
mountains
found
myself
sufficiently
at
leisure
to
look
deliberately
round
and
mark
the
different
aspects
of
men
and
things
in
a
region
which
though
bearing
the
same
name
and
calling
itself
the
same
land
was
in
many
respects
as
different
from
the
one
i
had
left
as
amsterdam
from
petersburg
there
every
man
was
straining
and
struggling
and
striving
for
himself
heaven
knows
here
every
white
man
was
waited
upon
more
or
less
by
a
slave
there
the
lands
rich
with
the
vegetable
manure
accumulated
for
ages
demanded
the
slightest
labour
to
return
the
richest
produce
where
the
plough
entered
crops
the
most
abundant
followed
but
where
it
came
not
no
spot
of
native
verdure
no
native
fruits
no
native
flowers
cheered
the
eye
all
was
close
dark
stifling
forest
here
the
soil
had
long
ago
yielded
its
first
fruits
much
that
had
been
cleared
and
cultivated
for
tobacco
the
most
exhausting
of
crops
by
the
english
required
careful
and
laborious
husbandry
to
produce
any
return
and
much
was
left
as
it
was
in
these
spots
that
the
natural
bounty
of
the
soil
and
climate
was
displayed
by
the
innumerable
wild
fruits
and
flowers
which
made
every
dingle
and
bushy
dell
seem
a
garden
on
entering
the
cottages
i
found
also
a
great
difference
in
the
manner
of
living
here
indeed
there
were
few
cottages
without
a
slave
but
there
were
fewer
still
that
had
their
beefsteak
and
onions
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
the
herrings
of
the
bountiful
potomac
supply
their
place
these
are
excellent
relish
as
they
call
it
when
salted
and
if
i
mistake
not
are
sold
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
thousand
whiskey
however
flows
every
where
at
the
same
fatally
cheap
rate
of
twenty
cents
about
one
shilling
the
gallon
and
its
hideous
effects
are
visible
on
the
countenance
of
every
man
you
meet
the
class
of
people
the
most
completely
unlike
any
existing
in
england
are
those
who
farming
their
own
freehold
estates
and
often
possessing
several
slaves
yet
live
with
as
few
of
the
refinements
and
i
think
i
may
say
with
as
few
of
the
comforts
of
life
as
the
very
poorest
english
peasant
when
in
maryland
i
went
into
the
houses
of
several
of
these
small
proprietors
and
remained
long
enough
and
looked
and
listened
sufficiently
to
obtain
a
tolerably
correct
idea
of
their
manner
of
living
one
of
these
families
consisted
of
a
young
man
his
wife
two
children
a
female
slave
and
two
young
lads
slaves
also
the
farm
belonged
to
the
wife
and
i
was
told
consisted
of
about
three
hundred
acres
of
indifferent
land
but
all
cleared
the
house
was
built
of
wood
and
looked
as
if
the
three
slaves
might
have
overturned
it
had
they
pushed
hard
against
the
gable
end
it
contained
one
room
of
about
twelve
feet
square
and
another
adjoining
it
hardly
larger
than
a
closet
this
second
chamber
was
the
of
the
white
part
of
the
family
above
these
rooms
was
a
loft
without
windows
where
i
was
told
the
staying
company
who
visited
them
were
lodged
near
this
mansion
was
a
shanty
a
black
hole
without
any
window
which
served
as
kitchen
and
all
other
offices
and
also
as
the
lodging
of
the
blacks
we
were
invited
to
take
tea
with
this
family
and
readily
consented
to
do
so
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
one
heavy
huge
table
and
about
six
wooden
chairs
when
we
arrived
the
lady
was
in
rather
a
dusky
dishabille
but
she
vehemently
urged
us
to
be
seated
and
then
retired
into
the
above
mentioned
whence
she
continued
to
address
to
us
from
behind
the
door
all
kinds
of
genteel
country
visiting
talk
and
at
length
emerged
upon
us
in
a
smart
new
dress
her
female
slave
set
out
the
great
table
and
placed
upon
it
cups
of
the
very
coarsest
blue
ware
a
little
brown
sugar
in
one
and
a
tiny
drop
of
milk
in
another
no
butter
though
the
lady
assured
us
she
had
a
and
two
cows
instead
of
butter
she
hoped
we
would
fix
a
little
relish
with
our
crackers
in
ancient
english
eat
salt
meat
and
dry
biscuits
such
was
the
fare
and
for
guests
that
certainly
were
intended
to
be
honoured
i
could
not
help
recalling
the
delicious
repasts
which
i
remembered
to
have
enjoyed
at
little
dairy
farms
in
england
not
but
rented
and
at
high
rents
too
where
the
clean
bustling
mistress
herself
skimmed
the
delicious
cream
herself
spread
the
yellow
butter
on
the
delightful
brown
loaf
and
placed
her
curds
and
her
junket
and
all
the
delicate
treasures
other
dairy
before
us
and
then
with
hospitable
pride
placed
herself
at
her
board
and
added
the
more
delicate
relish
of
good
tea
and
good
cream
i
remembered
all
this
and
did
not
think
the
difference
atoned
for
by
the
dignity
of
having
my
cup
handed
to
me
by
a
slave
the
lady
i
now
visited
however
greatly
surpassed
my
quondam
friends
in
the
refinement
of
her
conversation
she
ambled
through
the
whole
time
the
visit
lasted
in
a
sort
of
elegantly
mincing
familiar
style
of
gossip
which
i
think
she
was
imitating
from
some
novel
for
i
was
told
she
was
a
great
novel
reader
and
left
all
household
occupations
to
be
performed
by
her
slaves
to
say
she
addressed
us
in
a
tone
of
equality
will
give
no
adequate
idea
of
her
manner
i
am
persuaded
that
no
misgiving
on
the
subject
ever
entered
her
head
she
told
us
that
their
estate
was
her
of
her
property
she
had
married
a
first
cousin
who
was
as
fine
a
gentleman
as
she
was
a
lady
and
as
idle
preferring
hunting
as
they
called
shooting
to
any
other
occupation
the
consequence
was
that
but
a
very
small
portion
of
the
dividend
was
cultivated
and
their
poverty
was
extreme
the
slaves
particularly
the
lads
were
considerably
more
than
half
naked
but
the
air
of
dignity
with
which
in
the
midst
of
all
this
misery
the
lanky
lady
said
to
one
of
the
young
negroes
attend
to
your
young
master
lycurgus
must
have
been
heard
to
be
conceived
in
the
full
extent
of
its
mock
heroic
another
dwelling
of
one
of
these
landed
proprietors
was
a
hovel
as
wretched
as
the
one
above
described
but
there
was
more
industry
within
it
the
gentleman
indeed
was
himself
one
of
the
numerous
tribe
of
regular
whiskey
drinkers
and
was
rarely
capable
of
any
work
but
he
had
a
family
of
twelve
children
who
with
their
skeleton
mother
worked
much
harder
than
i
ever
saw
negroes
do
they
were
accordingly
much
less
elegant
and
much
less
poor
than
the
heiress
yet
they
lived
with
no
appearance
of
comfort
and
with
i
believe
nothing
beyond
the
necessaries
of
life
one
proof
of
this
was
that
the
worthless
father
would
not
suffer
them
to
raise
even
by
their
own
labour
any
garden
vegetables
and
they
lived
upon
their
fat
pork
salt
fish
and
corn
bread
summer
and
winter
without
variation
this
i
found
was
frequently
the
case
among
the
farmers
the
luxury
of
whiskey
is
more
appreciated
by
the
men
than
all
the
green
delicacies
from
the
garden
and
if
all
the
ready
money
goes
for
that
and
their
darling
chewing
tobacco
none
can
be
spent
by
the
wife
for
garden
seeds
and
as
far
as
my
observation
extended
i
never
saw
any
american
where
the
toast
and
no
toast
question
would
have
been
decided
in
favour
of
the
lady
there
are
some
small
farmers
who
hold
their
lands
as
tenants
but
these
are
by
no
means
numerous
they
do
not
pay
their
rent
in
money
but
by
making
over
a
third
of
the
produce
to
the
owner
a
mode
of
paying
rent
considerably
more
advantageous
to
the
tenant
than
the
landlord
but
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
in
payment
excepting
for
mere
retail
articles
is
very
great
in
all
american
transactions
i
can
pay
in
is
the
offer
which
i
was
assured
is
constantly
made
on
all
occasions
and
if
rejected
then
i
guess
we
ca
deal
is
the
usual
rejoinder
this
statement
does
not
of
course
include
the
great
merchants
of
great
cities
but
refers
to
the
mass
of
the
people
scattered
over
the
country
it
has
indeed
been
my
object
in
speaking
of
the
customs
of
the
people
to
give
an
idea
of
what
they
are
the
effect
produced
upon
english
people
by
the
sight
of
slavery
in
every
direction
is
very
new
and
not
very
agreeable
and
it
is
not
the
less
painfully
felt
from
hearing
upon
every
breeze
the
mocking
words
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
one
must
be
in
the
heart
of
american
slavery
fully
to
appreciate
that
wonderfully
fine
passage
in
moore
epistle
to
lord
viscount
forbes
which
describes
perhaps
more
faithfully
as
well
as
more
powerfully
the
political
state
of
america
than
any
thing
that
has
ever
been
written
upon
it
oh
freedom
freedom
how
i
hate
thy
cant
not
eastern
bombast
nor
the
savage
rant
of
purpled
madmen
were
they
numbered
all
from
roman
nero
down
to
russian
paul
could
grate
upon
my
ear
so
mean
so
base
as
the
rank
jargon
of
that
factious
race
who
poor
of
heart
and
prodigal
of
words
born
to
be
slaves
and
struggling
to
be
lords
but
pant
for
licence
while
they
spurn
controul
and
shout
for
rights
with
rapine
in
their
soul
who
can
with
patience
for
a
moment
see
the
medley
mass
of
pride
and
misery
of
whips
and
charters
manacles
and
rights
of
slaving
blacks
and
democratic
whites
of
all
the
pyebald
polity
that
reigns
in
free
confusion
columbia
plains
to
think
that
man
thou
just
and
gentle
god
should
stand
before
thee
with
a
tyrant
rod
creatures
like
himself
with
soul
from
thee
yet
dare
to
boast
of
perfect
liberty
away
away
i
rather
hold
my
neck
by
doubtful
tenure
from
a
sultan
beck
in
climes
where
liberty
has
scarce
been
named
nor
any
right
but
that
of
ruling
claimed
than
thus
to
live
where
bastard
freedom
waves
her
fustian
flag
in
mockery
slaves
where
motley
laws
admitting
no
degree
betwixt
the
vilely
slaved
and
madly
free
alike
the
bondage
and
the
licence
suit
the
brute
made
ruler
and
the
man
made
brute
the
condition
of
domestic
slaves
however
does
not
generally
appear
to
be
bad
but
the
ugly
feature
is
that
should
it
be
so
they
have
no
power
to
change
it
i
have
seen
much
kind
attention
bestowed
upon
the
health
of
slaves
but
it
is
on
these
occasions
impossible
to
forget
that
did
this
attention
fail
a
valuable
piece
of
property
would
be
endangered
unhappily
the
slaves
too
know
this
and
the
consequence
is
that
real
kindly
feeling
very
rarely
can
exist
between
the
parties
it
is
said
that
slaves
born
in
a
family
are
attached
to
the
children
of
it
who
have
grown
up
with
them
this
may
be
the
case
where
the
petty
acts
of
infant
tyranny
have
not
been
sufficient
to
conquer
the
kindly
feeling
naturally
produced
by
long
and
early
association
and
this
sort
of
attachment
may
last
as
long
as
the
slave
can
be
kept
in
that
state
of
profound
ignorance
which
precludes
reflection
the
law
of
virginia
has
taken
care
of
this
the
state
legislators
may
truly
be
said
to
be
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
and
they
ensure
their
safety
by
forbidding
light
to
enter
among
them
by
the
law
of
virginia
it
is
penal
to
teach
any
slave
to
read
and
it
is
penal
to
be
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
act
of
instructing
them
this
law
speaks
volumes
domestic
slaves
are
generally
speaking
tolerably
well
fed
and
decently
clothed
and
the
mode
in
which
they
are
lodged
seems
a
matter
of
great
indifference
to
them
they
are
rarely
exposed
to
the
lash
and
they
are
carefully
nursed
in
sickness
these
are
the
favourable
features
of
their
situation
the
sad
one
is
that
they
may
be
sent
to
the
south
and
sold
this
is
the
dread
of
all
the
slaves
north
of
louisiana
the
sugar
plantations
and
more
than
all
the
rice
grounds
of
georgia
and
the
carolinas
are
the
terror
of
american
negroes
and
well
they
may
be
for
they
open
an
early
grave
to
thousands
and
to
it
is
needful
to
make
their
previous
labour
pay
their
value
there
is
something
in
the
system
of
breeding
and
rearing
negroes
in
the
northern
states
for
the
express
purpose
of
sending
them
to
be
sold
in
the
south
that
strikes
painfully
against
every
feeling
of
justice
mercy
or
common
humanity
during
my
residence
in
america
i
became
perfectly
persuaded
that
the
state
of
a
domestic
slave
in
a
gentleman
family
was
preferable
to
that
of
a
hired
american
help
both
because
they
are
more
cared
for
and
valued
and
because
their
condition
being
born
with
them
their
spirits
do
not
struggle
against
it
with
that
pining
discontent
which
seems
the
lot
of
all
free
servants
in
america
but
the
case
is
widely
different
with
such
as
in
their
own
persons
or
those
of
their
children
loved
in
vain
are
exposed
to
the
dreadful
traffic
above
mentioned
in
what
is
their
condition
better
than
that
of
the
kidnapped
negroes
on
the
coast
of
africa
of
the
horror
in
which
this
enforced
migration
is
held
i
had
a
strong
proof
during
our
stay
in
virginia
the
father
of
a
young
slave
who
belonged
to
the
lady
with
whom
we
boarded
was
destined
to
this
fate
and
within
an
hour
after
it
was
made
known
to
him
he
sharpened
the
hatchet
with
which
he
had
been
felling
timber
and
with
his
right
hand
severed
his
left
from
the
wrist
but
this
is
a
subject
on
which
i
do
not
mean
to
dilate
it
has
been
lately
treated
most
judiciously
by
a
far
abler
hand
see
captain
hall
travels
in
america
its
effects
on
the
moral
feelings
and
external
manners
of
the
people
are
all
i
wish
to
observe
upon
and
these
are
unquestionably
most
injurious
the
same
man
who
beards
his
wealthier
and
more
educated
neighbour
with
the
bullying
boast
i
as
good
as
you
turns
to
his
slave
and
knocks
him
down
if
the
furrow
he
has
ploughed
or
the
log
he
has
felled
please
not
this
stickler
for
equality
there
is
a
glaring
falsehood
on
the
very
surface
of
such
a
principles
that
is
revolting
it
is
not
among
the
higher
classes
that
the
possession
of
slaves
produces
the
worst
effects
among
the
poorer
class
of
landholders
who
are
often
as
profoundly
ignorant
as
the
negroes
they
own
the
effect
of
this
plenary
power
over
males
and
females
is
most
demoralising
and
the
kind
of
coarse
not
to
say
brutal
authority
which
is
exercised
furnishes
the
most
disgusting
moral
spectacle
i
ever
witnessed
in
all
ranks
however
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
greatest
and
best
feelings
of
the
human
heart
were
paralyzed
by
the
relative
positions
of
slave
and
owner
the
characters
the
hearts
of
children
are
irretrievably
injured
by
it
in
virginia
we
boarded
for
some
time
in
a
family
consisting
of
a
widow
and
her
four
daughters
and
i
there
witnessed
a
scene
strongly
indicative
of
the
effect
i
have
mentioned
a
young
female
slave
about
eight
years
of
age
had
found
on
the
shelf
of
a
cupboard
a
biscuit
temptingly
buttered
of
which
she
had
eaten
a
considerable
portion
before
she
was
observed
the
butter
had
been
copiously
sprinkled
with
arsenic
for
the
destruction
of
rats
and
had
been
thus
most
incautiously
placed
by
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
family
as
soon
as
the
circumstance
was
known
the
lady
of
the
house
came
to
consult
me
as
to
what
had
best
be
done
for
the
poor
child
i
immediately
mixed
a
large
cup
of
mustard
and
water
the
most
rapid
of
all
emetics
and
got
the
little
girl
to
swallow
it
the
desired
effect
was
instantly
produced
but
the
poor
child
partly
from
nausea
and
partly
from
the
terror
of
hearing
her
death
proclaimed
by
half
a
dozen
voices
round
her
trembled
so
violently
that
i
thought
she
would
fall
i
sat
down
in
the
court
where
we
were
standing
and
as
a
matter
of
course
took
the
little
sufferer
in
my
lap
i
observed
a
general
titter
among
the
white
members
of
the
family
while
the
black
stood
aloof
and
looked
stupified
the
youngest
of
the
family
a
little
girl
about
the
age
of
the
young
slave
after
gazing
at
me
for
a
few
moments
in
utter
astonishment
exclaimed
my
if
trollope
has
not
taken
her
in
her
lap
and
wiped
her
nasty
mouth
why
i
would
not
have
touched
her
mouth
for
two
hundred
dollars
the
little
slave
was
laid
on
a
bed
and
i
returned
to
my
own
apartments
some
time
afterwards
i
sent
to
enquire
for
her
and
learnt
that
she
was
in
great
pain
i
immediately
went
myself
to
enquire
farther
when
another
young
lady
of
the
family
the
one
by
whose
imprudence
the
accident
had
occurred
met
my
anxious
enquiries
with
mirth
told
me
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
and
then
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
the
idea
of
really
sympathising
in
the
sufferings
of
a
slave
appeared
to
them
as
absurd
as
weeping
over
a
calf
that
had
been
slaughtered
by
the
butcher
the
daughters
of
my
hostess
were
as
lovely
as
features
and
complexion
could
make
them
but
the
neutralizing
effect
of
this
total
want
of
feeling
upon
youth
and
beauty
must
be
witnessed
to
be
conceived
there
seems
in
general
a
strong
feeling
throughout
america
that
none
of
the
negro
race
can
be
trusted
and
as
fear
according
to
their
notions
is
the
only
principle
by
which
a
slave
can
be
actuated
it
is
not
wonderful
if
the
imputation
be
just
but
i
am
persuaded
that
were
a
different
mode
of
moral
treatment
pursued
most
important
and
beneficial
consequences
would
result
from
it
negroes
are
very
sensible
to
kindness
and
might
i
think
be
rendered
more
profitably
obedient
by
the
practice
of
it
towards
them
than
by
any
other
mode
of
discipline
whatever
to
emancipate
them
entirely
throughout
the
union
can
not
i
conceive
be
thought
of
consistently
with
the
safety
of
the
country
but
were
the
possibility
of
amelioration
taken
into
the
consideration
of
the
legislature
with
all
the
wisdom
justice
and
mercy
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
the
negro
population
of
the
union
might
cease
to
be
a
terror
and
their
situation
no
longer
be
a
subject
either
of
indignation
or
of
pity
i
observed
every
where
throughout
the
slave
states
that
all
articles
which
can
be
taken
and
consumed
are
constantly
locked
up
and
in
large
families
where
the
extent
of
the
establishment
multiplies
the
number
of
keys
these
are
deposited
in
a
basket
and
consigned
to
the
care
of
a
little
negress
who
is
constantly
seen
following
her
mistress
steps
with
this
basket
on
her
arm
and
this
not
only
that
the
keys
may
be
always
at
hand
but
because
should
they
be
out
of
sight
one
moment
that
moment
would
infallibly
be
employed
for
purposes
of
plunder
it
seemed
to
me
in
this
instance
as
in
many
others
that
the
close
personal
attendance
of
these
sable
shadows
must
be
very
annoying
but
whenever
i
mentioned
it
i
was
assured
that
no
such
feeling
existed
and
that
use
rendered
them
almost
unconscious
of
their
presence
i
had
indeed
frequent
opportunities
of
observing
this
habitual
indifference
to
the
presence
of
their
slaves
they
talk
of
them
of
their
condition
of
their
faculties
of
their
conduct
exactly
as
if
they
were
incapable
of
hearing
i
once
saw
a
young
lady
who
when
seated
at
table
between
a
male
and
a
female
was
induced
by
her
modesty
to
intrude
on
the
chair
of
her
female
neighbour
to
avoid
the
indelicacy
of
touching
the
elbow
of
a
man
i
once
saw
this
very
young
lady
lacing
her
stays
with
the
most
perfect
composure
before
a
negro
footman
a
virginian
gentleman
told
me
that
ever
since
he
had
married
he
had
been
accustomed
to
have
a
negro
girl
sleep
in
the
same
chamber
with
himself
and
his
wife
i
asked
for
what
purpose
this
nocturnal
attendance
was
necessary
good
heaven
was
the
reply
if
i
wanted
a
glass
of
water
during
the
night
what
would
become
of
me
chapter
fruits
and
flowers
of
maryland
and
virginia
snake
insects
elections
our
summer
in
maryland
was
delightful
the
thermometer
stood
at
but
the
heat
was
by
no
means
so
oppressive
as
what
we
had
felt
in
the
west
in
no
part
of
north
america
are
the
natural
productions
of
the
soil
more
various
or
more
beautiful
strawberries
of
the
richest
flavour
sprung
beneath
our
feet
and
when
these
past
away
every
grove
every
lane
every
field
looked
like
a
cherry
orchard
offering
an
inexhaustible
profusion
of
fruit
to
all
who
would
take
the
trouble
to
gather
it
then
followed
the
peaches
every
hedgerow
was
planted
with
them
and
though
the
fruit
did
not
equal
in
size
or
flavour
those
ripened
on
our
garden
walls
we
often
found
them
good
enough
to
afford
a
delicious
refreshment
on
our
long
rambles
but
it
was
the
flowers
and
the
flowering
shrubs
that
beyond
all
else
rendered
this
region
the
most
beautiful
i
had
ever
seen
the
alleghany
always
excepted
no
description
can
give
an
idea
of
the
variety
the
profusion
the
luxuriance
of
them
if
i
talk
of
wild
roses
the
english
reader
will
fancy
i
mean
the
pale
ephemeral
blossoms
of
our
bramble
hedges
but
the
wild
roses
of
maryland
and
virginia
might
be
the
choicest
favourites
of
the
flower
garden
they
are
rarely
very
double
but
the
brilliant
eye
atones
for
this
they
are
of
all
shades
from
the
deepest
crimson
to
the
tenderest
pink
the
scent
is
rich
and
delicate
in
size
they
exceed
any
single
roses
i
ever
saw
often
measuring
above
four
inches
in
diameter
the
leaf
greatly
resembles
that
of
the
china
rose
it
is
large
dark
firm
and
brilliant
the
sweetbrier
grows
wild
and
blossoms
abundantly
both
leaves
and
flowers
are
considerably
larger
than
with
us
the
acacia
or
as
it
is
there
called
the
locust
blooms
with
great
richness
and
profusion
i
have
gathered
a
branch
less
than
a
foot
long
and
counted
twelve
full
bunches
of
flowers
on
it
the
scent
is
equal
to
the
orange
flower
the
dogwood
is
another
of
the
splendid
white
blossoms
that
adorn
the
woods
its
lateral
branches
are
flat
like
a
fan
and
dotted
all
over
with
blossoms
as
large
as
those
of
the
another
pretty
shrub
of
smaller
size
is
the
poison
alder
it
is
well
that
its
noxious
qualities
are
very
generally
known
for
it
is
most
tempting
to
the
eye
by
its
delicate
bunches
of
white
flowers
even
the
touch
of
this
shrub
is
poisonous
and
produces
violent
swelling
the
arbor
judae
is
abundant
in
every
wood
and
its
bright
and
delicate
pink
is
the
earliest
harbinger
of
the
american
spring
azalias
white

and
pink
kalmias
of
every
variety
the

sweet

stately

there
the
plant
known
in
england
as
the
virginian
creeper
is
often
seen
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
highest
forest
trees
and
bearing
a
large
shaped
blossom
of
a
rich
scarlet
the
sassafras
is
a
beautiful
shrub
and
i
can
not
imagine
why
it
has
not
been
naturalized
in
england
for
it
has
every
appearance
of
being
extremely
hardy
the
leaves
grow
in
tufts
and
every
tuft
contains
leaves
of
five
or
six
different
forms
the
fruit
is
singularly
beautiful
it
resembles
in
form
a
small
acorn
and
is
jet
black
the
cup
and
stem
looking
as
if
they
were
made
of
red
coral
the
graceful
and
fantastic
grapevine
is
a
feature
of
great
beauty
and
its
wandering
festoons
bear
no
more
resemblance
to
our
vines
than
our
stunted
azalias
and
tiny
magnolias
to
their
thriving
american
kindred
there
is
another
charm
that
haunts
the
summer
wanderer
in
america
and
it
is
perhaps
the
only
one
found
in
greatest
perfection
in
the
west
but
it
is
beautiful
every
where
in
a
bright
day
during
any
of
the
summer
months
your
walk
is
through
an
atmosphere
of
butterflies
so
gaudy
in
hue
and
so
varied
in
form
that
i
often
thought
they
looked
like
flowers
on
the
wing
some
of
them
are
very
large
measuring
three
or
four
inches
across
the
wings
but
many
and
i
think
the
most
beautiful
are
smaller
than
ours
some
have
wings
of
the
most
dainty
lavender
colour
and
bodies
of
black
others
are
fawn
and
rose
colour
and
others
again
are
orange
and
bright
blue
but
pretty
as
they
are
it
is
their
number
even
more
than
their
beauty
that
delights
the
eye
their
gay
and
noiseless
movement
as
they
glance
through
the
air
crossing
each
other
in
chequered
maze
is
very
beautiful
the
is
another
pretty
summer
toy
but
they
are
not
sufficiently
numerous
nor
do
they
live
enough
on
the
wing
to
render
them
so
important
a
feature
in
the
transatlantic
show
as
the
butterflies
the
was
a
far
more
brilliant
novelty
in
moist
situations
or
before
a
storm
they
are
very
numerous
and
in
the
dark
sultry
evening
of
a
burning
day
when
all
employment
was
impossible
i
have
often
found
it
a
pastime
to
watch
their
glancing
light
now
here
now
there
now
seen
now
gone
shooting
past
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
looking
like
a
shower
of
falling
stars
blown
about
in
the
breeze
of
evening
in
one
of
our
excursions
we
encountered
and
slew
a
copperhead
snake
i
escaped
treading
on
it
by
about
three
inches
while
we
were
contemplating
our
conquered
foe
and
doubting
in
our
ignorance
if
he
were
indeed
the
deadly
we
had
so
often
heard
described
a
farmer
joined
us
who
as
soon
as
he
cast
his
eyes
on
our
victim
exclaimed
my
if
you
have
not
got
a
copper
that
right
down
well
done
they
be
darnation
beasts
he
told
us
that
he
had
once
seen
a
bite
himself
to
death
from
being
teazed
by
a
stick
while
confined
in
a
cage
where
he
could
find
no
other
victim
we
often
heard
terrible
accounts
of
the
number
of
these
desperate
reptiles
to
be
found
on
the
rocks
near
the
great
falls
of
the
potomac
but
not
even
the
terror
these
stories
inspired
could
prevent
our
repeated
visits
to
that
sublime
scene
luckily
our
temerity
was
never
punished
by
seeing
any
there
lizards
long
large
and
most
hideously
like
a
miniature
crocodile
i
frequently
saw
gliding
from
the
fissures
of
the
rocks
and
darting
again
under
shelter
perhaps
beneath
the
very
stone
i
was
seated
upon
but
every
one
assured
us
they
were
harmless
animal
life
is
so
infinitely
abundant
and
in
forms
so
various
and
so
novel
to
european
eyes
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
divest
oneself
of
all
the
petty
terrors
which
the
crawling
creeping
hopping
and
buzzing
tribes
can
inspire
before
taking
an
american
summer
ramble
it
is
i
conceive
quite
impossible
for
any
description
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
sounds
which
assail
the
ears
from
the
time
the
short
twilight
begins
until
the
rising
sun
scatters
the
rear
of
darkness
and
sends
the
winking
choristers
to
rest
be
where
you
will
excepting
in
the
large
cities
the
appalling
note
of
the
will
reach
you
loud
deep
and
hoarse
issuing
from
a
thousand
throats
in
ceaseless
continuity
of
croak
the
adds
her
chirping
and
almost
human
voice
the
kattiedid
repeats
her
own
name
through
the
livelong
night
the
whole
tribe
of
locusts
chirp
chirrup
squeak
whiz
and
whistle
without
allowing
one
instant
of
interval
to
the
weary
ear
and
when
to
this
the
mosquito
adds
her
threatening
hum
it
is
wonderful
that
any
degree
of
fatigue
can
obtain
for
the
listener
the
relief
of
sleep
in
fact
it
is
only
in
ceasing
to
listen
that
this
blessing
can
be
found
i
passed
many
feverish
nights
during
my
first
summer
literally
in
listening
to
this
most
astounding
mixture
of
noises
and
it
was
only
when
they
became
too
familiar
to
excite
attention
that
i
recovered
my
rest
i
know
not
by
what
whimsical
link
of
association
the
recapitulation
of
this
insect
din
suggests
the
recollection
of
other
discords
at
least
as
harsh
and
much
more
troublesome
even
in
the
retirement
in
which
we
passed
this
summer
we
were
not
beyond
reach
of
the
election
fever
which
is
constantly
raging
through
the
land
had
america
every
attraction
under
heaven
that
nature
and
social
enjoyment
can
offer
this
electioneering
madness
would
make
me
fly
it
in
disgust
it
engrosses
every
conversation
it
irritates
every
temper
it
substitutes
party
spirit
for
personal
esteem
and
in
fact
vitiates
the
whole
system
of
society
when
a
candidate
for
any
office
starts
his
party
endow
him
with
every
virtue
and
with
all
the
talents
they
are
all
ready
to
peck
out
the
eyes
of
those
who
oppose
him
and
in
the
warm
and
mettlesome
states
do
literally
often
perform
this
operation
but
as
soon
as
he
succeeds
his
virtues
and
his
talents
vanish
and
excepting
those
holding
office
under
his
appointment
every
man
jonathan
of
them
set
off
again
full
gallop
to
elect
his
successor
when
i
first
arrived
in
america
john
quincy
adams
was
president
and
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
even
from
the
statement
of
his
enemies
that
he
was
every
way
calculated
to
do
honour
to
the
office
all
i
ever
heard
against
him
was
that
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
but
a
new
candidate
must
be
set
up
and
adams
was
for
no
other
reason
that
i
could
learn
but
because
it
was
best
to
change
jackson
for
ever
was
therefore
screamed
from
the
majority
of
mouths
both
drunk
and
sober
till
he
was
elected
but
no
sooner
in
his
place
than
the
same
ceaseless
operation
went
on
again
with
clay
for
ever
for
its
i
was
one
morning
paying
a
visit
when
a
party
of
gentlemen
arrived
at
the
same
house
on
horseback
the
one
whose
air
proclaimed
him
the
chief
of
his
party
left
us
not
long
in
doubt
as
to
his
business
for
he
said
almost
in
entering
p
i
come
to
ask
for
your
vote
who
are
you
for
sir
was
the
reply
clay
for
ever
the
rejoinder
and
the
vote
was
promised
this
gentleman
was
candidate
for
a
place
in
the
state
representation
whose
members
have
a
vote
in
the
presidential
election
i
was
introduced
to
him
as
an
english
woman
he
addressed
me
with
well
madam
you
see
we
do
these
things
openly
and
here
you
mince
such
matters
more
i
expect
after
his
departure
his
history
and
standing
were
discussed
is
highly
respectable
and
of
very
good
standing
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
his
election
if
he
is
a
said
my
host
i
asked
what
his
station
was
the
lady
of
the
house
told
me
that
his
father
had
been
a
merchant
and
when
this
future
legislator
was
a
young
man
he
had
been
sent
by
him
to
some
port
in
the
mediterranean
as
his
the
youth
being
a
youth
appropriated
the
proceeds
to
his
own
uses
traded
with
great
success
upon
the
fund
thus
obtained
and
returned
after
an
absence
of
twelve
years
a
gentleman
of
fortune
and
excellent
standing
i
expressed
some
little
disapprobation
of
this
proceeding
but
was
assured
that
was
considered
by
every
one
as
a
very
honourable
man
were
i
to
relate
part
of
the
dishonest
transactions
recounted
to
me
by
americans
of
their
and
friends
i
am
confident
that
no
english
reader
would
give
me
credit
for
veracity
it
would
therefore
be
very
unwise
to
repeat
them
but
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
opinion
that
nearly
four
years
of
attentive
observation
impressed
on
me
namely
that
the
moral
sense
is
on
every
point
blunter
than
with
us
make
an
american
believe
that
his
neighbour
is
a
very
worthless
fellow
and
i
dare
say
if
he
were
quite
sure
he
could
make
nothing
by
him
he
would
drop
the
acquaintance
but
as
to
what
constitutes
a
worthless
fellow
people
differ
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
atlantic
almost
by
the
whole
decalogue
there
is
as
it
appeared
to
me
an
obtusity
on
all
points
of
honourable
feeling
cervantes
laughed
spain
chivalry
away
but
he
did
not
laugh
away
that
better
part
of
chivalry
so
beautifully
described
by
burke
as
the
unbought
grace
of
life
the
cheap
defence
of
nations
that
chastity
of
honour
which
feels
a
stain
as
a
wound
which
ennobles
whatever
it
touches
and
by
which
vice
itself
loses
half
its
evil
by
losing
all
its
grossness
the
better
part
of
chivalry
still
mixes
with
gentle
blood
in
every
part
of
europe
nor
is
it
less
fondly
guarded
than
when
sword
and
buckler
aided
its
defence
perhaps
this
unbought
grace
of
life
is
not
to
be
looked
for
where
chivalry
has
never
been
i
certainly
do
not
lament
the
decadence
of
knight
errantry
nor
wish
to
exchange
the
protection
of
the
laws
for
that
of
the
doughtiest
champion
who
ever
set
lance
in
rest
but
i
do
in
truth
believe
that
this
knightly
sensitiveness
of
honourable
feeling
is
the
best
antidote
to
the
petty
transactions
of
every
day
life
and
that
the
total
want
of
it
is
one
reason
why
this
race
care
so
very
little
for
the
vulgar
virtue
called
probity
chapter
journey
to
philadelphia
chesapeak
and
delaware
canal
city
of
philadelphia
miss
wright
lecture
in
the
latter
part
of
august
we
paid
a
visit
to
philadelphia
and
notwithstanding
the
season
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
have
both
bright
and
temperate
weather
for
the
expedition
the
road
from
washington
to
baltimore
which
was
our
first
day
journey
is
interesting
in
summer
from
the
variety
of
luxuriance
of
the
foliage
which
borders
great
parts
of
it
we
passed
the
night
at
baltimore
and
embarked
next
morning
on
board
a
for
philadelphia
the
scenery
of
the
elk
river
upon
which
you
enter
soon
after
leaving
the
port
of
baltimore
is
not
beautiful
we
embarked
at
six
in
the
morning
and
at
twelve
reached
the
chesapeak
and
delaware
canal
we
then
quitted
the
and
walked
two
or
three
hundred
yards
to
the
canal
where
we
got
on
board
a
pretty
little
decked
boat
sheltered
by
a
neat
awning
and
drawn
by
four
horses
this
canal
cuts
across
the
state
of
delaware
and
connects
the
chesapeak
and
delaware
rivers
it
has
been
a
work
of
great
expense
though
the
distance
is
not
more
than
thirteen
miles
for
a
considerable
part
of
this
distance
the
cutting
has
been
very
deep
and
the
banks
are
in
many
parts
thatched
to
prevent
their
crumbling
at
the
point
where
the
cutting
is
deepest
a
light
bridge
is
thrown
across
which
from
its
great
height
forms
a
striking
object
to
the
travellers
passing
below
it
every
boat
that
passes
this
canal
pays
a
toll
of
twenty
dollars
nothing
can
be
less
interesting
than
that
part
of
the
state
of
delaware
through
which
this
cut
passes
the
mississippi
hardly
excepted
at
one
we
reached
the
delaware
river
at
a
point
nearly
opposite
delaware
fort
which
looks
recently
built
and
is
very
handsome
this
fort
was
destroyed
by
fire
a
few
months
afterwards
here
we
again
changed
our
vessel
and
got
on
board
another
of
their
noble
both
these
changes
were
made
with
the
greatest
regularity
and
dispatch
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
the
scenery
of
the
delaware
the
stream
is
wide
and
the
banks
are
flat
a
short
distance
before
you
reach
philadelphia
two
large
buildings
of
singular
appearance
strike
the
eye
on
enquiry
i
learnt
that
they
were
erected
for
the
purpose
of
sheltering
two
ships
of
war
they
are
handsomely
finished
with
very
neat
roofs
and
are
ventilated
by
many
windows
the
expense
of
these
buildings
must
have
been
considerable
but
as
the
construction
of
the
vast
machines
they
shelter
was
more
so
it
may
be
good
economy
we
reached
philadelphia
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
approach
to
this
city
is
not
so
striking
as
that
to
baltimore
though
much
larger
it
does
not
now
show
itself
so
well
it
wants
domes
and
columns
it
is
nevertheless
a
beautiful
city
nothing
can
exceed
its
neatness
the
streets
are
well
paved
the
as
in
all
the
old
american
cities
is
of
brick
like
the
old
pantile
walk
at
tunbridge
wells
this
is
almost
entirely
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
the
awnings
which
in
all
the
principal
streets
are
spread
from
the
shop
windows
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
the
city
is
built
with
extreme
and
almost
wearisome
regularity
the
streets
which
run
north
and
south
are
distinguished
by
numbers
from
one
to
i
know
not
how
many
but
i
paid
a
visit
in
twelth
street
these
are
intersected
at
right
angles
by
others
which
are
known
by
the
names
of
various
trees
mulberry
more
commonly
called
chesnut
and
walnut
appear
the
most
fashionable
in
each
of
these
there
is
a
theatre
this
mode
of
distinguishing
the
streets
is
commodious
to
strangers
from
the
facility
it
gives
of
finding
out
whereabouts
you
are
if
you
ask
for
the
united
states
bank
you
are
told
it
is
in
chesnut
between
third
and
fourth
and
as
the
streets
are
all
divided
from
each
other
by
equal
distances
of
about
three
hundred
feet
you
are
sure
of
not
missing
your
mark
there
are
many
handsome
houses
but
none
that
are
very
splendid
they
are
generally
of
brick
and
those
of
the
better
order
have
white
marble
steps
and
some
few
door
frames
of
the
same
beautiful
material
but
on
the
whole
there
is
less
display
of
it
in
the
private
dwellings
than
at
baltimore
the
americans
all
seem
greatly
to
admire
this
city
and
to
give
it
the
preference
in
point
of
beauty
to
all
others
in
the
union
but
i
do
not
agree
with
them
there
are
some
very
handsome
buildings
but
none
of
them
so
placed
as
to
produce
a
striking
effect
as
is
the
case
both
with
the
capitol
and
the
house
at
washington
notwithstanding
these
fine
buildings
one
or
more
of
which
are
to
be
found
in
all
the
principal
streets
the
is
every
where
the
same
there
is
no
place
de
louis
quinze
or
carrousel
no
regent
street
or
green
park
to
make
one
exclaim
how
beautiful
all
is
even
straight
uniform
and
uninteresting
there
is
one
spot
however
about
a
mile
from
the
town
which
presents
a
lovely
scene
the
of
philadelphia
have
not
yet
perhaps
as
wide
extended
fame
as
those
of
marley
but
they
are
not
less
deserving
it
at
a
most
beautiful
point
of
the
schuylkill
river
the
water
has
been
forced
up
into
a
magnificent
reservoir
ample
and
elevated
enough
to
send
it
through
the
whole
city
the
vast
yet
simple
machinery
by
which
this
is
achieved
is
open
to
the
public
who
resort
in
such
numbers
to
see
it
that
several
evening
stages
run
from
philadelphia
to
fair
mount
for
their
accommodation
but
interesting
and
curious
as
this
machinery
is
fair
mount
would
not
be
so
attractive
had
it
not
something
else
to
offer
it
is
in
truth
one
of
the
very
prettiest
spots
the
eye
can
look
upon
a
broad
weir
is
thrown
across
the
schuylkill
which
produces
the
sound
and
look
of
a
cascade
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
is
a
gentleman
seat
the
beautiful
lawns
of
which
slope
to
the
water
edge
and
groups
of
and
other
trees
throw
their
shadows
on
the
stream
the
works
themselves
are
enclosed
in
a
simple
but
very
handsome
building
of
freestone
which
has
an
extended
front
opening
upon
a
terrace
which
overhangs
the
river
behind
the
building
and
divided
from
it
only
by
a
lawn
rises
a
lofty
wall
of
solid
limestone
rock
which
has
at
one
or
two
points
been
cut
into
for
the
passage
of
the
water
into
the
noble
reservoir
above
from
the
crevices
of
this
rock
the
catalpa
was
every
where
pushing
forth
covered
with
its
beautiful
blossom
beneath
one
of
these
trees
an
artificial
opening
in
the
rock
gives
passage
to
a
stream
of
water
clear
and
bright
as
crystal
which
is
received
in
a
stone
basin
of
simple
workmanship
having
a
cup
for
the
service
of
the
thirsty
traveller
at
another
point
a
portion
of
the
water
in
its
upward
way
to
the
reservoir
is
permitted
to
spring
forth
in
a
perpetual
that
returns
in
a
silver
shower
upon
the
head
of
a
marble
of
snowy
whiteness
the
statue
is
not
the
work
of
phidias
but
its
dark
rocky
background
the
flowery
catalpas
which
shadow
it
and
the
bright
shower
through
which
it
shows
itself
altogether
make
the
scene
one
of
singular
beauty
add
to
which
the
evening
on
which
i
saw
it
was
very
sultry
and
the
contrast
of
this
cool
spot
to
all
besides
certainly
enhanced
its
attraction
it
was
impossible
not
to
envy
the
nymph
her
eternal
on
returning
from
this
excursion
we
saw
handbills
in
all
parts
of
the
city
announcing
that
miss
wright
was
on
that
evening
to
deliver
her
parting
address
to
the
citizens
of
philadelphia
at
the
arch
street
theatre
previous
to
her
departure
for
europe
i
immediately
determined
to
hear
her
and
did
so
though
not
without
some
difficulty
from
the
crowds
who
went
thither
with
the
same
intention
the
house
which
is
a
very
pretty
one
was
filled
in
every
part
including
the
stage
with
a
well
dressed
and
most
attentive
audience
there
was
a
larger
proportion
of
ladies
present
than
i
ever
saw
on
any
other
occasion
in
an
american
theatre
one
reason
for
this
might
be
perhaps
that
they
were
admitted
gratis
miss
wright
came
on
the
stage
surrounded
by
a
body
guard
of
quaker
ladies
in
the
full
costume
of
their
sect
she
was
as
she
always
is
startling
in
her
theories
but
powerfully
eloquent
and
on
the
whole
was
much
applauded
though
one
passage
produced
great
emotion
and
some
hissing
she
stated
broadly
on
the
authority
of
jefferson
furnished
by
his
posthumous
works
that
washington
was
not
a
christian
one
voice
from
the
crowded
pit
exclaimed
in
an
accent
of
indignation
washington
was
a
christian
but
it
was
evident
that
the
majority
of
the
audience
considered
assertion
as
a
compliment
to
the
country
idol
for
the
hissing
was
soon
triumphantly
clapped
down
general
washington
himself
however
gives
a
somewhat
different
account
of
his
own
principles
for
in
his
admirable
farewell
address
on
declining
a
to
the
presidency
i
find
the
following
passage
of
all
the
dispositions
and
habits
which
lead
to
political
prosperity
religion
and
morality
are
indispensable
supports
in
vain
would
that
man
claim
the
tribute
of
patriotism
who
would
labour
to
subvert
these
great
pillars
of
human
happiness
these
firmest
props
of
the
destinies
of
men
and
citizens
a
volume
could
not
trace
all
their
connections
with
private
and
public
felicity
and
let
us
with
caution
indulge
the
supposition
that
morality
can
be
maintained
without
religion
reason
and
experience
both
forbid
us
to
expect
that
national
morality
can
prevail
in
exclusion
of
religious
principle
whether
jefferson
or
himself
knew
best
what
his
principles
were
i
will
not
decide
but
at
least
it
appears
fair
when
repeating
one
statement
to
add
the
other
also
chapter
washington
square

beauty
gallery
of

theatres
museum
our
mornings
were
spent
as
all
travellers
mornings
must
be
in
asking
questions
and
in
seeing
all
that
the
answers
told
us
it
was
necessary
to
see
perhaps
this
can
be
done
in
no
city
with
more
facility
than
in
philadelphia
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
up
one
straight
street
and
down
another
till
all
the
parallelograms
have
been
threaded
in
doing
this
you
will
see
many
things
worth
looking
at
the
united
states
and
pennsylvania
banks
are
the
most
striking
buildings
and
are
both
extremely
handsome
being
of
white
marble
and
built
after
grecian
models
the
state
house
has
nothing
externally
to
recommend
it
but
the
room
shown
as
that
in
which
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
and
in
which
the
estimable
lafayette
was
received
half
a
century
after
he
had
shed
his
noble
blood
in
aiding
to
obtain
it
is
an
interesting
spot
at
one
end
of
this
room
is
a
statue
in
wood
of
general
washington
on
its
base
is
the
following
inscription
first
in
peace
first
in
war
and
first
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
there
is
a
very
pretty
enclosure
before
the
walnut
street
entrance
to
the
state
house
with
good
gravel
walks
and
many
of
their
beautiful
flowering
trees
it
is
laid
down
in
grass
not
in
turf
that
indeed
is
a
luxury
i
never
saw
in
america
near
this
enclosure
is
another
of
much
the
same
description
called
washington
square
here
there
was
an
excellent
crop
of
clover
but
as
the
trees
are
numerous
and
highly
beautiful
and
several
commodious
seats
are
placed
beneath
their
shade
it
is
in
spite
of
the
long
grass
a
very
agreeable
retreat
from
heat
and
dust
it
was
rarely
however
that
i
saw
any
of
these
seats
occupied
the
americans
have
either
no
leisure
or
no
inclination
for
those
moments
of
that
all
other
people
i
believe
indulge
in
even
their
drams
so
universally
taken
by
rich
and
poor
are
swallowed
standing
and
excepting
at
church
they
never
have
the
air
of
leisure
or
repose
this
pretty
washington
square
is
surrounded
by
houses
on
three
sides
but
lasso
has
a
prison
on
the
fourth
it
is
nevertheless
the
nearest
approach
to
a
london
square
that
is
to
be
found
in
philadelphia
one
evening
while
the
rest
of
my
party
went
to
visit
some
objects
which
i
had
before
seen
i
agreed
to
await
their
return
in
this
square
and
sat
down
under
a
magnificent
catalpa
which
threw
its
fragrant
blossoms
in
all
directions
the
other
end
of
the
bench
was
occupied
by
a
young
lady
who
was
employed
in
watching
the
gambols
of
a
little
boy
there
was
something
in
her
manner
of
looking
at
me
and
exchanging
a
smile
when
her
young
charge
performed
some
extraordinary
feat
of
activity
on
the
grass
that
persuaded
me
she
was
not
an
american
i
do
not
remember
who
spoke
first
but
we
were
presently
in
a
full
flow
of
conversation
she
spoke
english
with
elegant
correctness
but
she
was
a
german
and
with
an
ardour
of
feeling
which
gave
her
a
decidedly
foreign
air
in
philadelphia
she
talked
to
me
of
her
country
of
all
she
had
left
and
of
all
she
had
found
or
rather
of
all
she
had
not
found
for
thus
ran
her
lament
they
do
not
love
music
oh
no
and
they
never
amuse
themselves
no
and
their
hearts
are
not
warm
at
least
they
seem
not
so
to
strangers
and
they
have
no
ease
no
forgetfulness
of
business
and
of
care
no
not
for
a
moment
but
i
will
not
stay
long
i
think
for
i
should
not
live
she
told
me
that
she
had
a
brother
settled
there
as
a
merchant
and
that
she
had
passed
a
year
with
him
but
she
was
hoping
soon
to
return
to
her
father
land
i
never
so
strongly
felt
the
truth
of
the
remark
that
expression
is
the
soul
of
beauty
as
in
looking
at
and
listening
to
this
young
german
she
was
any
thing
but
handsome
it
is
true
she
had
large
eyes
full
of
gentle
expression
but
every
feature
was
irregular
but
oh
the
charm
of
that
smile
of
that
look
of
deep
feeling
which
animated
every
feature
when
she
spoke
of
her
own
germany
the
tone
of
her
voice
the
slight
and
graceful
action
which
accompanied
her
words
all
struck
me
as
so
attractive
that
the
half
hour
i
passed
with
her
was
continually
recurring
to
my
memory
i
had
often
taxed
myself
with
feeling
something
like
prejudice
against
the
beautiful
american
women
but
this
half
hour
set
my
conscience
at
rest
it
is
not
prejudice
which
causes
one
to
feel
that
regularity
of
features
is
insufficient
to
interest
or
even
to
please
beyond
the
first
glance
i
certainly
believe
the
women
of
america
to
be
the
handsomest
in
the
world
but
as
surely
do
i
believe
that
they
are
the
least
attractive
we
visited
the
nineteenth
annual
exhibition
of
the
pennsylvanian
academy
of
the
fine
arts
was
the
number
of
objects
exhibited
which
were
so
arranged
as
to
fill
three
tolerably
large
rooms
and
one
smaller
called
the
director
room
there
were
among
the
number
about
thirty
engravings
and
a
much
larger
proportion
of
drawings
about
seventy
had
the
pensylvanian
academician
annexed
to
the
name
of
the
artist
the
principal
historical
composition
was
a
large
scripture
piece
by
washington
alston
this
gentleman
is
spoken
of
as
an
artist
of
great
merit
and
i
was
told
that
his
manner
was
much
improved
since
this
picture
was
painted
it
bears
date
i
believe
it
was
for
this
picture
alston
received
a
prize
at
the
british
gallery
there
was
a
portrait
of
a
lady
which
in
the
catalogue
is
designated
as
the
white
plume
which
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
admired
in
the
collection
and
the
artist
ingham
is
said
to
rank
highest
among
the
of
america
this
picture
is
of
very
high
finish
particularly
the
drapery
which
is
most
elaborately
worked
even
to
the
pile
of
the
velvet
the
management
of
the
light
is
much
in
the
manner
of
good
but
the
drawing
is
very
defective
and
the
contour
though
the
face
is
a
lovely
one
hard
and
unfleshy
from
all
the
conversations
on
painting
which
i
listened
to
in
america
i
found
that
the
finish
of
drapery
was
considered
as
the
highest
excellence
and
next
to
this
the
resemblance
in
a
portrait
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
heard
the
words
or
used
in
any
conversation
on
the
subject
one
of
the
rooms
of
this
academy
has
inscribed
over
its
door
antique
statue
gallery
the
door
was
open
but
just
within
it
was
a
screen
which
prevented
any
objects
in
the
room
being
seen
from
without
upon
my
pausing
to
read
this
inscription
an
old
woman
who
appeared
to
officiate
as
guardian
of
the
gallery
hustled
up
and
addressing
me
with
an
air
of
much
mystery
said
now
now
this
is
just
the
time
for
you
nobody
can
see
you
make
haste
i
stared
at
her
with
unfeigned
surprise
and
disengaging
my
arm
which
she
had
taken
apparently
to
hasten
my
movements
i
very
gravely
asked
her
meaning
only
that
ladies
like
to
go
into
that
room
by
themselves
when
there
be
no
gentlemen
watching
them
on
entering
this
mysterious
apartment
the
first
thing
i
remarked
was
written
paper
deprecating
the
disgusting
depravity
which
had
led
some
of
the
visitors
to
mark
and
deface
the
casts
in
a
most
indecent
and
shameless
manner
this
abomination
has
unquestionably
been
occasioned
by
the
custom
which
sends
alternate
groups
of
males
and
females
into
the
room
were
the
antique
gallery
thrown
open
to
mixed
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
would
soon
cease
till
america
has
reached
the
degree
of
refinement
which
permits
of
this
the
antique
casts
should
not
be
exhibited
to
ladies
at
all
i
never
felt
my
delicacy
shocked
at
the
louvre
but
i
was
strangely
tempted
to
resent
as
an
affront
the
hint
i
received
that
i
might
steal
a
glance
at
what
was
deemed
indecent
perhaps
the
arrangements
for
the
exhibition
of
this
room
the
feelings
which
have
led
to
them
and
the
result
they
have
produced
furnish
as
good
a
specimen
of
the
kind
of
delicacy
on
which
the
americans
pride
themselves
and
of
the
peculiarities
arising
from
it
as
can
be
found
the
room
contains
about
fifty
casts
chiefly
from
the
antique
in
the
director
room
i
was
amused
at
the
means
which
a
poet
had
hit
upon
for
advertising
his
works
or
rather
his
work
and
not
less
at
the
elaborate
notice
of
it
his
portrait
was
suspended
there
and
attached
to
the
frame
was
a
paper
inscribed
thus
of
the
author
of
the
fredoniad
or
independence
preserved
a
political
naval
and
military
poem
on
the
late
war
of
in
forty
cantos
the
whole
compressed
in
four
volumes
each
volume
averaging
more
than
pages
by
richard
emmons
i
went
to
the
chesnut
street
theatre
to
see
booth
formerly
of
drury
lane
in
the
character
of
lear
and
a
duff
in
cordelia
but
i
have
seen
too
many
lears
and
cordelias
to
be
easily
pleased
i
thought
the
whole
performance
very
bad
the
theatre
is
of
excellently
moderate
dimensions
and
prettily
decorated
it
was
not
the
fashionable
season
for
the
theatres
which
i
presume
must
account
for
the
appearance
of
the
company
in
the
boxes
which
was
any
thing
but
elegant
nor
was
there
more
decorum
of
demeanour
than
i
had
observed
elsewhere
i
saw
one
man
in
the
lower
tier
of
boxes
deliberately
take
off
his
coat
that
he
might
enjoy
the
refreshing
coolness
of
shirt
sleeves
all
the
gentlemen
wore
their
hats
and
the
spitting
was
unceasing
on
another
evening
we
went
to
the
walnut
street
theatre
the
chief
attraction
of
the
night
was
furnished
by
the
performance
of
a
young
man
who
had
been
previously
exhibited
as
a
living
skeleton
he
played
the
part
of
jeremiah
thin
and
certainly
looked
the
part
well
and
here
i
think
must
end
my
praise
of
the
evening
performances
the
great
and
most
striking
contrast
between
this
city
and
those
of
europe
is
perceived
after
sunset
scarcely
a
sound
is
heard
hardly
a
voice
or
a
wheel
breaks
the
stillness
the
streets
are
entirely
dark
except
where
a
stray
lamp
marks
an
hotel
or
the
like
no
shops
are
open
but
those
of
the
apothecary
and
here
and
there
a
cook
shop
scarcely
a
step
is
heard
and
for
a
note
of
music
or
the
sound
of
mirth
i
listened
in
vain
in
leaving
the
theatre
which
i
always
did
before
the
afterpiece
i
saw
not
a
single
carriage
the
night
of
miss
wright
lecture
when
i
stayed
to
the
end
i
saw
one
this
darkness
this
stillness
is
so
great
that
i
almost
felt
it
awful
as
we
walked
home
one
fine
moonlight
evening
from
the
chestnut
street
house
we
stopped
a
moment
before
the
united
states
bank
to
look
at
its
white
marble
columns
by
the
subdued
lights
said
to
be
so
advantageous
to
them
the
building
did
indeed
look
beautiful
the
incongruous
objects
around
were
hardly
visible
while
the
brilliant
white
of
the
building
which
by
daylight
is
dazzling
was
mellowed
into
fainter
light
and
softer
shadow
while
pausing
before
this
modern
temple
of
theseus
we
remarked
that
we
alone
seemed
alive
in
this
great
city
it
was
ten
and
a
most
lovely
cool
evening
after
a
burning
day
yet
all
was
silence
regent
street
bond
street
with
their
blaze
of
and
still
more
the
italian
boulevard
of
paris
rose
in
strong
contrast

the
memory

light
which
outshines
that
of
day
the
gay
graceful
laughing
throng
the
elegant
saloons
of
tortoni
with
all
their
varieties
of
cooling
nectar
were
all
remembered
is
it
an
european
prejudice
to
deem
that
the
solitary
dram
swallowed
by
the
gentlemen
on
quitting
an
american
theatre
indicates
a
lower
and
more
vicious
state
of
manners
than
do
the
ices
so
sedulously
offered
to
the
ladies
on
leaving

the
museum
contains
a
good
collection
of
objects
illustrative
of
natural
history
and
some
very
interesting
specimens
of
indian
antiquities
both
here
and
at
cincinnati
i
saw
so
many
things
resembling
egyptian
relics
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
origin
of
the
indian
nations
enquired
into
more
accurately
than
has
yet
been
done
the
shops
of
which
there
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
unusually
large
proportion
are
very
handsome
many
of
them
in
a
style
of
european
elegance
lottery
offices
abound
and
that
species
of
gambling
is
carried
to
a
great
extent
i
saw
fewer
carriages
in
philadelphia
than
either
at
baltimore
or
washington
but
in
the
winter
i
was
told
they
were
more
numerous
many
of
the
best
families
had
left
the
city
for
different
and
others
were
daily
following

is
a
fashionable
bathing
place
on
the
jersey
shore
to
which
many
resort
both
from
this
place
and
from
new
york
the
description
given
of
the
manner
of
bathing
appeared
to
me
rather
extraordinary
but
the
account
was
confirmed
by
so
many
different
people
that
i
could
not
doubt
its
correctness
the
shore
it
seems
is
too
bold
to
admit
of
bathing
machines
and
the
ladies
have
therefore
recourse
to
another
mode
of
ensuring
the
enjoyment
of
a
with
safety
the
accommodation
at
long
branch
is
almost
entirely
at
large
where
all
the
company
live
at
a
it
is
customary
for
ladies
on
arriving
to
look
round
among
the
married
gentlemen
the
first
time
they
meet
at
table
and
to
select
the
one
her
fancy
leads
her
to
prefer
as
a
protector
in
her
purposed
visits
to
the

of
neptune
she
makes
her
request
which
is
always
graciously
received
that
he
would
lead
her
to
taste
the
briny
wave
but
another
fair
one
must
select
the
same
protector
else
the
arrangement

influence
of

in

i
had
never
chanced
among
all
my
wanderings
to
enter
a
quaker
and
as
i
thought
i
could
no
where
make
my
first
visit
better
than
at
philadelphia
i
went
under
the
protection
of
a
quaker
lady
to
the
principal
meeting
of
the
city
the
building
is
large
but
perfectly
without
ornament
the
men
and
women
are
separated
by
a
rail
which
divides
it
into
two
equal
parts
the
meeting
was
very
full
on
both
sides
and
the
atmosphere
almost
intolerably
hot
as
they
glided
in
at
their
different
doors
i
spied
many
pretty
faces
peeping
from
the
prim
head
gear
of
the
females
and
as
the
males
sat
down
the
welcome
parney
supposes
prepared
for
them
in
heaven
recurred
to
me
entre
done
et
garde
ton

the
little
bonnets
and
the
large
hats
were
ranged
in
long
rows
and
their
stillness
was
for
a
long
time
so
unbroken
that
i
could
hardly
persuade
myself
the
figures
they
surmounted
were
alive
at
length
a
grave
square
man
arose
laid
aside
his
ample
beaver
and
after
another
solemn
interval
of
silence
he
gave
a
deep
groan
and
as
it
were
by
the
same
effort
uttered
keep
thy
foot
again
he
was
silent
for
many
minutes
and
then
he
continued
for
more
that
an
hour
to
put
forth
one
word
at
a
time
but
at
such
an
interval
from
each
other
that
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
follow
his
meaning
if
indeed
he
had
any
my
quaker
friend
told
me
she
knew
not
who
he
was
and
that
she
much
regretted
i
had
heard
so
poor
a
preacher
after
he
had
concluded
a
old
man
a
physician
by
profession
arose
and
delivered
a
few
moral
sentences
in
an
agreeable
manner
soon
after
he
had
sat
down
the
whole
congregation
rose
i
know
not
at
what
signal
and
made
their
exit
it
is
a
singular
kind
of
worship
if
worship
it
may
be
called
where
all
prayer
is
forbidden
yet
it
appeared
to
me
in
its
decent
quietness
infinitely
preferable
to
what
i
had
witnessed
at
the
presbyterian
and
methodist
a
great
schism
had
lately
taken
place
among
the
quakers
of
philadelphia
many
objecting
to
the
discipline
of
the
orthodox
among
the
seceders
there
are
again
various
shades
of
difference
i
met
many
who
called
themselves
unitarian
quakers
others
were
hicksites
and
others
again
though
still
wearing
the
quaker
habit
were
said
to
be
deists
we
visited
many
churches
and
chapels
in
the
city
but
none
that
would
elsewhere
be
called
handsome
either
internally
or
externally
i
went
one
evening
not
a
sunday
with
a
party
of
ladies
to
see
a
presbyterian
minister
inducted
the
ceremony
was
woefully
long
and
the
charge
to
the
young
man
awfully
impossible
to
obey
at
least
if
he
were
a
man
like
unto
other
men
it
was
matter
of
astonishment
to
me
to
observe
the
deep
attention
and
the
unwearied
patience
with
which
some
hundreds
of
beautiful
young
girls
who
were
assembled
there
not
to
mention
the
old
ladies
listened
to
the
whole
of
this
tedious
ceremony
surely
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
religion
makes
so
large
a
part
of
the
amusement
and
occupation
of
the
ladies
spain
in
its
most
catholic
days
could
not
exceed
it
besides
in
spite
of
the
gloomy
horrors
of
the
inquisition
gaiety
and
amusement
were
not
there
offered
as
a
sacrifice
by
the
young
and
lovely
the
religious
severity
of
philadelphian
manners
is
in
nothing
more
conspicuous
than
in
the
number
of
chains
thrown
across
the
streets
on
a
sunday
to
prevent
horses
and
carriages
from
passing
surely
the
jews
could
not
exceed
this
country
in
their
external
observances
what
the
gentlemen
of
philadelphia
do
with
themselves
on
a
sunday
i
will
not
pretend
to
guess
but
the
prodigious
majority
of
females
in
the
churches
is
very
remarkable
although
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
of
this
city
are
quakers
the
same
extraordinary
variety
of
faith
exists
here
as
every
where
else
in
the
union
and
the
priests
have
in
some
circles
the
same
unbounded
influence
which
has
been
mentioned
elsewhere
one
history
reached
me
which
gave
a
terrible
picture
of
the
effect
this
power
may
produce
it
was
related
to
me
by
my
a
young
woman
highly
estimable
as
a
wife
and
mother
and
on
whose
veracity
i
perfectly
rely
she
told
me
that
her
father
was
a
widower
and
lived
with
his
family
of
three
daughters
at
philadelphia
a
short
time
before
she
married
an
itinerant
preacher
came
to
the
city
who
contrived
to
obtain
an
intimate
footing
in
many
respectable
families
her
father
was
one
of
these
and
his
influence
and
authority
were
great
with
all
the
sisters
but
particularly
with
the
youngest
the
young
girl
feelings
for
him
seem
to
have
been
a
curious
mixture
of
spiritual
awe
and
earthly
affection
when
she
received
a
hint
from
her
sisters
that
she
ought
not
to
give
him
too
much
encouragement
till
he
spoke
out
she
showed
as
much
holy
resentment
as
if
they
had
told
her
not
to
say
her
prayers
too
devoutly
at
length
the
father
remarked
the
sort
of
covert
passion
that
gleamed
through
the
eyes
of
his
godly
visitor
and
he
saw
too
the
pallid
anxious
look
which
had
settled
on
the
young
brow
of
his
daughter
either
this
or
some
rumours
he
had
heard
abroad
or
both
together
led
him
to
forbid
this
man
his
house
the
three
girls
were
present
when
he
did
so
and
all
uttered
a
deprecating
oh
father
but
the
old
man
added
stoutly
if
you
show
yourself
here
again
reverend
sir
i
will
not
only
teach
you
the
way
out
of
my
house
but
out
of
the
city
also
the
preacher
withdrew
and
was
never
heard
of
in
philadelphia
afterwards
but
when
a
few
months
had
passed
strange
whispers
began
to
creep
through
the
circle
which
had
received
and
honoured
him
and
in
due
course
of
time
no
less
than
seven
unfortunate
girls
produced
living
proofs
of
the
wisdom
of
my
worthy
father
in
defence
of
this
dreadful
story
i
can
only
make
the
often
repeated
quotation
i
tell
the
tale
as
was
told
to
me
but
in
all
sincerity
i
must
add
that
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
truth
i
was
particularly
requested
to
visit
the
market
of
philadelphia
at
the
hour
when
it
presented
the
busiest
scene
i
did
so
and
thought
few
cities
had
any
thing
to
show
better
worth
looking
at
it
is
indeed
the
very
perfection
of
a
market
the
of
a
notable
housewife
who
would
confide
to
no
deputy
the
important
office
of
caterer
the
neatness
freshness
and
entire
absence
of
every
thing
disagreeable
to
sight
or
smell
must
be
witnessed
to
be
believed
the
stalls
were
spread
with
napkins
flowers
and
fruit
if
not
quite
of
paris
or
london
perfection
yet
bright
fresh
and
fragrant
with
excellent
vegetables
in
the
greatest
variety
and
abundance
were
all
so
delightfully
exhibited
that
objects
less
pleasing
were
overlooked
and
forgotten
the
dairy
the
the
forest
the
river
and
the
ocean
all
contributed
their
spoil
in
short
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
thought
a
market
a
beautiful
object
the
prices
of
most
articles
were
as
nearly
as
i
could
calculate
between
dollars
and
francs
about
the
same
as
at
paris
certainly
much
cheaper
than
in
london
but
much
dearer
than
at
exeter
my
letters
of
introduction
brought
me
acquainted
with
several
amiable
and
interesting
people
there
is
something
in
the
tone
of
manners
at
philadelphia
that
i
liked
it
appeared
to
me
that
there
was
less
affectation
of
ton
there
than
elsewhere
there
is
a
quietness
a
composure
in
a
philadelphia
that
is
quite
characteristic
of
a
city
founded
by
william
penn
the
dress
of
the
ladies
even
those
who
are
not
quakers
partakes
of
this
they
are
most
elegantly
neat
and
there
was
a
delicacy
and
good
taste
in
the
dress
of
the
young
ladies
that
might
serve
as
a
model
to
the
whole
union
there
can
hardly
be
a
stronger
contrast
in
the
style
of
dress
between
any
two
cities
than
may
be
remarked
between
baltimore
and
philadelphia
both
are
costly
but
the
former
is
distinguished
by
gaudy
splendour
the
latter
by
elegant
simplicity
it
is
said
that
this
city
has
many
gentlemen
distinguished
by
their
scientific
pursuits
i
conversed
with
several
well
informed
and
intelligent
men
but
there
is
a
cold
dryness
of
manner
and
an
apparent
want
of
interest
in
the
subjects
they
discuss
that
to
my
mind
robs
conversation
of
all
its
charm
on
one
occasion
i
heard
the
character
and
situation
of
an
illustrious
officer
discussed
who
had
served
with
renown
under
napoleon
and
whose
high
character
might
have
obtained
him
favour
under
the
bourbons
could
he
have
abandoned
the
principles
which
led
him
to
dislike
their
government
this
distinguished
man
had
retreated
to
america
after
the
death
of
his
master
and
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
sort
of
polytechnic
academy
at
new
york
in
speaking
of
him
i
observed
that
his
devotion
to
the
cause
of
freedom
must
prove
a
strong
recommendation
in
the
united
states
not
the
least
in
the
world
madam
answered
a
gentleman
who
ranked
deservedly
high
among
the
of
the
city
it
might
avail
him
much
in
england
perhaps
but
here
we
are
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
what
people
principles
may
be
this
i
believe
to
be
exactly
true
though
i
never
before
heard
it
avowed
as
a
national
feature
the
want
of
warmth
of
interest
of
feeling
upon
all
subjects
which
do
not
immediately
touch
their
own
concerns
is
universal
and
has
a
most
paralysing
effect
upon
conversation
all
the
enthusiasm
of
america
is
concentrated
to
the
one
point
of
her
own
emancipation
and
independence
on
this
point
nothing
can
exceed
the
warmth
of
her
feelings
she
may
i
think
be
compared
to
a
young
bride
a
sort
of
major
waddle
her
independence
is
to
her
as
a
bridegroom
for
him
alone
she
has
eyes
ears
or
heart
the
honeymoon
is
not
over
yet
when
it
is
america
will
perhaps
learn
more
coquetry
and
know
better
how
to
to
other
nations
i
conceive
that
no
place
in
the
known
world
can
furnish
so
striking
a
proof
of
the
immense
value
of
literary
habits
as
the
united
states
not
only
in
enlarging
the
mind
but
what
is
of
infinitely
more
importance
in
purifying
the
manners
during
my
abode
in
the
country
i
not
only
never
met
a
literary
man
who
was
a
tobacco
chewer
or
a
whiskey
drinker
but
i
never
met
any
who
were
not
that
had
escaped
these
degrading
habits
on
the
women
the
influence
is
if
possible
still
more
important
unfortunately
the
instances
are
rare
but
they
are
to
be
found
one
admirable
example
occurs
in
the
person
of
a
young
lady
of
cincinnati
surrounded
by
a
society
totally
incapable
of
appreciating
or
even
of
comprehending
her
she
holds
a
place
among
it
as
simply
and
unaffectedly
as
if
of
the
same
species
young
beautiful
and
gifted
by
nature
with
a
mind
singularly
acute
and
discriminating
she
has
happily
found
such
opportunities
of
cultivation
as
might
distinguish
her
in
any
country
it
is
indeed
that
best
of
all
cultivation
which
is
only
to
be
found
in
domestic
habits
of
literature
and
in
that
hourly
education
which
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
letters
receives
when
she
is
made
the
companion
and
friend
of
her
father
this
young
lady
is
the
more
admirable
as
she
contrives
to
unite
all
the
multifarious
duties
which
usually
devolve
upon
american
ladies
with
her
intellectual
pursuits
the
companion
and
efficient
assistant
of
her
father
literary
labours
the
active
aid
in
all
the
household
cares
of
her
mother
the
tender
nurse
of
a
delicate
infant
sister
the
skilful
artificer
of
her
own
always
elegant
wardrobe
ever
at
leisure
and
ever
prepared
to
receive
with
the
sweetest
cheerfulness
her
numerous
acquaintance
the
most
animated
in
conversation
the
most
indefatigable
in
occupation
it
was
impossible
to
know
her
and
study
her
character
without
feeling
that
such
women
were
the
glory
of
all
lands
and
could
the
race
be
multiplied
would
speedily
become
the
reformers
of
all
the
grossness
and
ignorance
that
now
degrade
her
own
is
it
to
be
imagined
that
if
fifty
modifications
of
this
charming
young
woman
were
to
be
met
at
a
party
the
men
would
dare
to
enter
it
reeking
with
whiskey
their
lips
blackened
with
tobacco
and
convinced
to
the
very
centre
of
their
hearts
and
souls
that
women
were
made
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
fabricate
sweetmeats
and
gingerbread
construct
shirts
darn
stockings
and
become
mothers
of
possible
presidents
assuredly
not
should
the
women
of
america
ever
discover
what
their
power
might
be
and
compare
it
with
what
it
is
much
improvement
might
be
hoped
for
while
at
philadelphia
among
the
handsomest
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
distinguished
of
the
land
their
comparative
influence
in
society
with
that
possessed
in
europe
by
females
holding
the
same
station
occurred
forcibly
to
my
mind
let
me
be
permitted
to
describe
the
day
of
a
philadelphian
lady
of
the
first
class
and
the
inference
i
would
draw
from
it
will
be
better
understood
it
may
be
said
that
the
most
important
feature
in
a
history
is
her
maternity
it
is
so
but
the
object
of
the
present
observation
is
the
social
and
not
the
domestic
influence
of
woman
this
lady
shall
be
the
wife
of
a
senator
and
a
lawyer
in
the
highest
repute
and
practice
she
has
a
very
handsome
house
with
white
marble
steps
and
and
a
delicate
silver
knocker
and
she
has
very
handsome
very
handsomely
furnished
there
is
a
sideboard
in
one
of
them
but
it
is
very
handsome
and
has
very
handsome
decanters
and
cut
glass
upon
it
she
has
a
very
handsome
carriage
and
a
very
handsome
free
black
coachman
she
is
always
very
handsomely
dressed
and
moreover
she
is
very
handsome
herself
she
rises
and
her
first
hour
is
spent
in
the
scrupulously
nice
arrangement
of
her
dress
she
descends
to
her
parlour
neat
stiff
and
silent
her
breakfast
is
brought
in
by
her
free
black
footman
she
eats
her
fried
ham
and
her
salt
fish
and
drinks
her
coffee
in
silence
while
her
husband
reads
one
newspaper
and
puts
another
under
his
elbow
and
then
perhaps
she
washes
the
cups
and
saucers
her
carriage
is
ordered
at
eleven
till
that
hour
she
is
employed
in
the
her
apron
protecting
her
silk
twenty
minutes
before
her
carriage
should
appear
she
retires
to
her
chamber
as
she
calls
it
shakes
and
folds
up
her
still
apron
smooths
her
rich
dress
and
with
nice
care
sets
on
her
elegant
bonnet
and
all
the
handsome
then
walks
down
stairs
just
at
the
moment
that
her
free
black
coachman
announces
to
her
free
black
footman
that
the
carriage
waits
she
steps
into
it
and
gives
the
word
drive
to
the
dorcas
society
her
footman
stays
at
home
to
clean
the
knives
but
her
coachman
can
trust
his
horses
while
he
opens
the
carriage
door
and
his
lady
not
being
accustomed
to
a
hand
or
an
arm
gets
out
very
safely
without
though
one
of
her
own
is
occupied
by
a
and
the
other
by
a
large
roll
of
all
those
indescribable
matters
which
ladies
take
as
offerings
to
dorcas
societies
she
enters
the
parlour
appropriated
for
the
meeting
and
finds
seven
other
ladies
very
like
herself
and
takes
her
place
among
them
she
presents
her
contribution
which
is
accepted
with
a
gentle
circular
smile
and
her
parings
of
broad
cloth
her
ends
of
ribbon
her
gilt
paper
and
her
minikin
pins
are
added
to
the
parings
of
broad
cloth
the
ends
of
ribbon
the
gilt
papers
and
the
minikin
pins
with
which
the
table
is
already
covered
she
also
produces
from
her
basket
three
pincushions
four
seven
paper
matches
and
a
these
are
welcomed
with
acclamations
and
the
youngest
lady
present
deposits
them
carefully
on
shelves
amid
a
prodigious
quantity
of
similar
articles
she
then
produces
her
thimble
and
asks
for
work
it
is
presented
to
her
and
the
eight
ladies
all
stitch
together
for
some
hours
their
talk
is
of
priests
and
of
missions
of
the
profits
of
their
last
sale
of
their
hopes
from
the
next
of
the
doubt
whether
your
mr
this
or
young
that
should
receive
the
fruits
of
it
to
fit
him
out
for
liberia
of
the
very
ugly
bonnet
seen
at
church
on
sabbath
morning
of
the
very
handsome
preacher
who
performed
on
sabbath
afternoon
and
of
the
very
large
collection
made
on
sabbath
evening
this
lasts
till
three
when
the
carriage
again
appears
and
the
lady
and
her
basket
return
home
she
mounts
to
her
chamber
carefully
sets
aside
her
bonnet
and
its
appurtenances
puts
on
her
scolloped
black
silk
apron
walks
into
the
kitchen
to
see
that
all
is
right
then
into
the
parlour
where
having
cast
a
careful
glance
over
the
table
prepared
for
dinner
she
sits
down
work
in
hand
to
await
her
spouse
he
comes
shakes
hands
with
her
spits
and
dines
the
conversation
is
not
much
and
ten
minutes
suffices
for
the
dinner
fruit
and
toddy
the
newspaper
and
the
succeed
in
the
evening
the
gentleman
being
a
savant
goes
to
the
wister
society
and
afterwards
plays
a
snug
rubber
at
a
neighbour
the
lady
receives
at
tea
a
young
missionary
and
three
members
of
the
dorcas
and
so
ends
her
day
for
some
reason
or
other
which
english
people
are
not
very
likely
to
understand
a
great
number
of
young
married
persons
board
by
the
year
instead
of
going
to
housekeeping
as
they
call
having
an
establishment
of
their
own
of
course
this
statement
does
not
include
persons
of
large
fortune
but
it
does
include
very
many
whose
rank
in
society
would
make
such
a
mode
of
life
quite
impossible
with
us
i
can
hardly
imagine
a
contrivance
more
effectual
for
ensuring
the
insignificance
of
a
woman
than
marrying
her
at
seventeen
and
placing
her
in
a
nor
can
i
easily
imagine
a
life
of
more
uniform
dulness
for
the
lady
herself
but
this
certainly
is
a
matter
of
taste
i
have
heard
many
ladies
declare
that
it
is
just
quite
the
perfection
of
comfort
to
have
nothing
to
fix
for
oneself
yet
despite
these
assurances
i
always
experienced
a
feeling
which
hovered
between
pity
and
contempt
when
i
contemplated
their
mode
of
existence
how
would
a
englishwoman
endure
it
her
head
and
her
heart
full
of
the
one
dear
scheme
well
ordered
home
dear
delight
to
make
she
must
rise
exactly
in
time
to
reach
the
boarding
table
at
the
hour
appointed
for
breakfast
or
she
will
get
a
stiff
bow
from
the
lady
president
cold
coffee
and
no
egg
i
have
been
sometimes
greatly
amused
upon
these
occasions
by
watching
a
little
scene
in
which
the
had
much
more
meaning
than
the
words
uttered
the
fasting
but
tardy
lady
looks
round
the
table
and
having
ascertained
that
there
was
no
egg
left
says
distinctly
i
will
take
an
egg
if
you
please
but
as
this
is
addressed
to
no
one
in
particular
no
one
in
particular
answers
it
unless
it
happen
that
her
husband
is
at
table
before
her
and
then
he
says
there
are
no
eggs
my
dear
whereupon
the
lady
president
evidently
can
not
hear
and
the
greedy
culprit
who
has
swallowed
two
eggs
for
there
are
always
as
many
eggs
as
noses
looks
pretty
considerably
afraid
of
being
found
out
the
breakfast
proceeds
in
sombre
silence
save
that
sometimes
a
parrot
and
sometimes
a
canary
bird
ventures
to
utter
a
timid
note
when
it
is
finished
the
gentlemen
hurry
to
their
occupation
and
the
quiet
ladies
mount
the
stairs
some
to
the
first
some
to
the
second
and
some
to
the
third
stories
in
an
inverse
proportion
to
the
number
of
dollars
paid
and
ensconce
themselves
in
their
respective
chambers
as
to
what
they
do
there
it
is
not
very
easy
to
say
but
i
believe
they
a
little
and
iron
a
little
and
sit
in
a
and
sew
a
great
deal
i
always
observed
that
the
ladies
who
boarded
wore
more
elaborately
worked
collars
and
petticoats
than
any
one
else
the
plough
is
hardly
a
more
blessed
instrument
in
america
than
the
needle
how
could
they
live
without
it
but
time
and
the
needle
wear
through
the
longest
morning
and
happily
the
american
morning
is
not
very
long
even
though
they
breakfast
at
eight
it
is
generally
about
two
that
the
boarding
gentlemen
meet
the
boarding
ladies
at
dinner
little
is
spoken
except
a
whisper
between
the
married
pairs
sometimes
a
sulky
bottle
of
wine
flanks
the
plate
of
one
or
two
individuals
but
it
adds
nothing
to
the
mirth
of
the
meeting
and
seldom
more
than
one
glass
to
the
good
cheer
of
the
owners
it
is
not
then
and
it
is
not
there
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
union
drink
soon
very
soon
the
silent
meal
is
done
and
then
if
you
mount
the
stairs
after
them
you
will
find
from
the
doors
of
the
more
affectionate
and
indulgent
wives
a
smell
of
cigars
steam
forth
which
plainly
indicates
the
felicity
of
the
couple
within
if
the
gentleman
be
a
very
polite
husband
he
will
as
soon
as
he
has
done
smoking
and
drinking
his
toddy
offer
his
arm
to
his
wife
as
far
as
the
corner
of
the
street
where
his
store
or
his
office
is
situated
and
there
he
will
leave
her
to
turn
which
way
she
likes
as
this
is
the
hour
for
being
full
dressed
of
course
she
turns
the
way
she
can
be
most
seen
perhaps
she
pays
a
few
visits
perhaps
she
goes
to
chapel
or
perhaps
she
enters
some
store
where
her
husband
deals
and
ventures
to
order
a
few
notions
and
then
she
goes
home
again
no
not
home
i
will
not
give
that
name
to
a
but
she
the
cold
heartless
atmosphere
in
which
she
dwells
where
hospitality
can
never
enter
and
where
interest
takes
the
management
instead
of
affection
at
tea
they
all
meet
again
and
a
little
trickery
is
perceptible
to
a
nice
observer
in
the
manner
of
partaking
the
after
this
those
who
are
happy
enough
to
have
engagements
hasten
to
keep
them
those
who
have
not
either
mount
again
to
the
solitude
of
their
chamber
or
what
appeared
to
me
much
worse
remain
in
the
common
in
a
society
cemented
by
no
tie
endeared
by
no
connexion
which
choice
did
not
bring
together
and
which
the
slightest
motive
would
break
asunder
i
remarked
that
the
gentlemen
were
generally
obliged
to
go
out
every
evening
on
business
and
i
confess
the
arrangement
did
not
surprise
me
it
is
not
thus
that
the
women
can
obtain
that
influence
in
society
which
is
allowed
to
them
in
europe
and
to
which
both
sages
and
men
of
the
world
have
agreed
in
ascribing
such
salutary
effects
it
is
in
vain
that
collegiate
institutes
are
formed
for
young
ladies
or
that
academic
degrees
are
conferred
upon
them
it
is
after
marriage
and
when
these
young
attempts
upon
all
the
sciences
are
forgotten
that
the
lamentable
insignificance
of
the
american
woman
appears
and
till
this
be
remedied
i
venture
to
prophesy
that
the
tone
of
their
will
not
improve
whilst
i
was
at
philadelphia
a
great
deal
of
attention
was
excited
by
the
situation
of
two
criminals
who
had
been
convicted
of
robbing
the
baltimore
mail
and
were
lying
under
sentence
of
death
the
rare
occurrence
of
capital
punishment
in
america
makes
it
always
an
event
of
great
interest
and
the
approaching
execution
was
repeatedly
the
subject
of
conversation
at
the
boarding
table
one
day
a
gentleman
told
us
he
had
that
morning
been
assured
that
one
of
the
criminals
had
declared
to
the
visiting
clergyman
that
he
was
certain
of
being
reprieved
and
that
nothing
the
clergyman
could
say
to
the
contrary
made
any
impression
upon
him
day
after
day
this
same
story
was
repeated
and
commented
upon
at
table
and
it
appeared
that
the
report
had
been
heard
in
so
many
quarters
that
not
only
was
the
statement
received
as
true
but
it
began
to
be
conjectured
that
the
criminal
had
some
ground
for
his
hope
i
learnt
from
these
daily
conversations
that
one
of
the
prisoners
was
an
american
and
the
other
an
irishman
and
it
was
the
former
who
was
so
strongly
persuaded
he
should
not
be
hanged
several
of
the
gentlemen
at
table
in
canvassing
the
subject
declared
that
if
the
one
were
hanged
and
the
other
spared
this
hanging
would
be
a
murder
and
not
a
legal
execution
in
discussing
this
point
it
was
stated
that
very
nearly
all
the
white
men
who
had
suffered
death
since
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
irishmen
what
truth
there
may
be
in
this
general
statement
i
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
all
i
know
is
that
i
heard
it
made
on
this
occasion
however
the
irishman
was
hanged
and
the
american
was
not
chapter
return
to
stonington
thunderstorm
emigrants
illness
alexandria
a
fortnight
passed
rapidly
away
in
this
great
city
and
doubtless
there
was
still
much
left
unseen
when
we
quitted
it
according
to
previous
arrangement
to
return
to
our
friends
in
maryland
we
came
back
by
a
different
route
going
by
land
from
newcastle
to
french
town
instead
of
passing
by
the
canal
we
reached
baltimore
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
finished
our
repose
on
board
the
and
started
for
washington
at
five
the
next
morning
our
short
abode
amid
the
heat
and
closeness
of
a
city
made
us
enjoy
more
than
ever
the
beautiful
scenery
around
stonington
the
autumn
which
soon
advanced
upon
us
again
clothed
the
woods
in
colours
too
varied
and
gaudy
to
be
conceived
by
those
who
have
never
quitted
europe
and
the
stately
maize
waving
its
flowing
tassels
as
the
long
drooping
blossoms
are
called
made
every
field
look
like
a
little
forest
a
rainy
spring
had
been
followed
by
a
summer
of
unusual
heat
and
towards
the
autumn
frequent
thunderstorms
of
terrific
violence
cleared
the
air
but
at
the
same
time
frightened
us
almost
out
of
our
wits
on
one
occasion
i
was
exposed
with
my
children
to
the
full
fury
of
one
of
these
awful
visitations
we
suffered
considerable
terror
during
this
storm
but
when
we
were
all
again
safe
and
comfortably
sheltered
we
rejoiced
that
the
accident
had
occurred
as
it
gave
us
the
best
possible
opportunity
of
witnessing
in
all
its
glory
a
transatlantic
thunderstorm
it
was
however
great
imprudence
that
exposed
us
to
it
for
we
quitted
the
house
and
mounted
a
hill
at
a
considerable
distance
from
it
for
the
express
purpose
of
watching
to
advantage
the
extraordinary
aspect
of
the
clouds
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
half
the
heavens
appeared
hung
with
a
heavy
curtain
a
sort
of
deep
blue
black
seemed
to
colour
the
very
air
the
blizzards
screamed
as
with
heavy
wing
they
sought
the
earth
we
ought
in
common
prudence
to
have
immediately
retreated
to
the
house
but
the
scene
was
too
beautiful
to
be
left
for
several
minutes
after
we
reached
our
station
the
air
appeared
perfectly
without
movement
no
flash
broke
through
the
cloud
but
a
flickering
light
was
visible
darting
to
and
fro
behind
it
by
degrees
the
thunder
rolled
onward
nearer
and
nearer
till
the
inky
cloud
burst
asunder
and
cataracts
of
light
came
pouring
from
behind
it
from
that
moment
there
was
no
interval
no
pause
the
lightning
did
not
flash
there
were
no
claps
of
thunder
but
the
heavens
blazed
and
bellowed
above
and
around
us
till
stupor
took
the
place
of
terror
and
we
stood
utterly
confounded
but
we
were
speedily
aroused
for
suddenly
as
if
from
beneath
our
feet
a
gust
arose
which
threatened
to
mix
all
the
elements
in
one
torrents
of
water
seemed
to
bruise
the
earth
by
their
violence
eddies
of
thick
dust
rose
up
to
meet
them
the
fierce
fires
of
heaven
only
blazed
the
brighter
for
the
falling
flood
while
the
blast
almost
the
thunder
but
the
wind
was
left
at
last
the
lord
of
all
for
after
striking
with
wild
force
now
here
now
there
and
bringing
worlds
of
clouds
together
in
most
hostile
contact
it
finished
by
clearing
the
wide
heavens
of
all
but
a
few
soft
straggling
masses
whence
sprung
a
glorious
rainbow
and
then
retired
leaving
the
earth
to
raise
her
half
crushed
forests
and
we
poor
pigmies
to
call
back
our
frighted
senses
and
recover
breath
as
we
might
during
this
gust
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
us
to
have
kept
our
feet
we
crouched
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
heap
of
stones
and
as
we
informed
each
other
looked
most
dismally
pale
many
trees
were
brought
to
the
earth
before
our
eyes
some
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
some
mighty
stems
snapt
off
several
feet
from
the
ground
if
the
west
indian
hurricanes
exceed
this
they
must
be
terrible
indeed
the
situation
of
s
house
was
considered
as
remarkably
healthy
and
i
believe
justly
so
for
on
more
than
one
occasion
persons
who
were
suffering
from
fever
and
ague
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
two
were
perfectly
restored
by
passing
a
week
or
fortnight
at
stonington
but
the
neighbourhood
of
it
particularly
on
the
side
bordering
the
potomac
was
much
otherwise
and
the
mortality
among
the
labourers
on
the
canal
was
frightful
i
have
elsewhere
stated
my
doubts
if
the
labouring
poor
of
our
country
mend
their
condition
by
emigrating
to
the
united
states
but
it
was
not
till
the
opportunity
which
a
vicinity
to
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
canal
gave
me
of
knowing
what
their
situation
was
after
making
the
change
that
i
became
fully
aware
how
little
it
was
to
be
desired
for
them
of
the
white
labourers
on
this
canal
the
great
majority
are
irishmen
their
wages
are
from
ten
to
fifteen
dollars
a
month
with
a
miserable
lodging
and
a
large
allowance
of
whiskey
it
is
by
means
of
this
hateful
poison
that
they
are
tempted
and
indeed
enabled
for
a
time
to
stand
the
broiling
heat
of
the
sun
in
a
most
noxious
climate
for
through
such
close
to
the
romantic
but
unwholesome
potomac
the
line
of
the
canal
has
hitherto
run
the
situation
of
these
poor
strangers
when
they
sink
at
last
in
fever
which
sooner
or
later
is
sure
to
overtake
them
is
dreadful
there
is
a
strong
feeling
against
the
irish
in
every
part
of
the
union
but
they
will
do
twice
as
much
work
as
a
negro
and
therefore
they
are
employed
when
they
fall
sick
they
may
and
must
look
with
envy
on
the
slaves
around
them
for
they
are
cared
for
they
are
watched
and
physicked
as
a
valuable
horse
is
watched
and
physicked
not
so
the
irishman
he
is
literally
thrown
on
one
side
and
a
new
comer
takes
his
place
details
of
their
sufferings
and
unheeded
death
too
painful
to
dwell
upon
often
reached
us
on
one
occasion
a
farmer
calling
at
the
house
told
the
family
that
a
poor
man
apparently
in
a
dying
condition
was
lying
beside
a
little
brook
at
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
spot
was
immediately
visited
by
some
of
the
family
and
there
in
truth
lay
a
poor
creature
who
was
already
past
the
power
of
speaking
he
was
conveyed
to
the
house
and
expired
during
the
night
by
enquiring
at
the
canal
it
was
found
that
he
was
an
irish
labourer
who
having
fallen
sick
and
spent
his
last
cent
had
left
the
stifling
shanty
where
he
lay
in
the
desperate
attempt
of
finding
his
way
to
washington
with
what
hope
i
know
not
he
did
not
appear
above
twenty
and
as
i
looked
on
his
pale
young
face
which
even
in
death
expressed
suffering
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
left
a
mother
and
a
home
to
seek
wealth
in
america
i
saw
him
buried
under
a
group
of
locust
trees
his
very
name
unknown
to
those
who
laid
him
there
but
the
attendance
of
the
whole
family
at
the
grave
gave
a
sort
of
decency
to
his
funeral
which
rarely
in
that
country
honors
the
poor
relics
of
british
dust
but
no
clergyman
attended
no
prayer
was
said
no
bell
was
tolled
these
indeed
are
ceremonies
unthought
of
and
in
fact
unattainable
without
much
expense
at
such
a
distance
from
a
town
had
the
poor
youth
been
an
american
he
would
have
been
laid
in
the
earth
in
the
same
unceremonious
manner
but
had
this
poor
irish
lad
fallen
sick
in
equal
poverty
and
destitution
among
his
own
people
he
would
have
found
a
blanket
to
wrap
his
shivering
limbs
and
a
kindred
hand
to
close
his
eyes
the
poor
of
great
britain
whom
distress
or
a
spirit
of
enterprise
tempt
to
try
another
land
ought
for
many
reasons
to
repair
to
canada
there
they
would
meet
and
sympathy
instead
of
malice
hatred
and
all
uncharitableness
i
frequently
heard
vehement
complaints
and
constantly
met
the
same
in
the
newspapers
of
a
practice
stated
to
be
very
generally
adopted
in
britain
of
sending
out
cargoes
of
parish
paupers
to
the
united
states
a
baltimore
paper
heads
some
such
remarks
with
the
words
infamous
conduct
and
then
tells
us
of
a
cargo
of
aged
paupers
just
arrived
from
england
adding
john
bull
has
squeezed
the
orange
and
now
insolently
casts
the
skin
in
our
faces
such
being
the
feeling
it
will
be
readily
believed
that
these
unfortunates
are
not
likely
to
meet
much
kindness
or
sympathy
in
sickness
or
in
suffering
of
any
kind
if
these
american
statements
be
correct
and
that
different
parishes
are
induced
from
an
excessive
population
to
pay
the
voyage
and
outfit
of
some
of
their
paupers
across
the
atlantic
why
not
send
them
to
canada
it
is
certain
however
that
all
the
enquiries
i
could
make
failed
to
substantiate
these
american
statements
all
i
could
ascertain
was
that
many
english
and
irish
poor
arrived
yearly
in
the
united
states
with
no
other
resources
than
what
their
labour
furnished
this
though
very
different
from
the
newspaper
stories
is
quite
enough
to
direct
attention
to
the
subject
it
is
generally
acknowledged
that
the
suffering
among
our
labouring
classes
arises
from
the
excess
of
our
population
and
it
is
impossible
to
see
such
a
country
as
canada
its
extent
its
fertility
its
fine
climate
and
know
that
it
is
british
ground
without
feeling
equal
sorrow
and
astonishment
that
it
is
not
made
the
means
of
relief
how
earnestly
it
is
to
be
wished
that
some
part
of
that
excellent
feeling
which
is
for
ever
at
work
in
england
to
help
the
distressed
could
be
directed
systematically
to
the
object
of
emigration
to
the
canadas
large
sums
are
annually
raised
for
charitable
purposes
by
weekly
subscriptions
of
one
penny
were
only
a
part
of
the
money
so
obtained
to
be
devoted
to
this
object
hundreds
of
families
might
yearly
be
sent
to
people
our
own
land
the
religious
feeling
which
so
naturally
mixes
with
every
charitable
purpose
would
there
find
the
best
field
for
its
exertions
where
could
a
missionary
whether
protestant
or
catholic
find
a
holier
mission
than
that
which
sent
him
to
comfort
and
instruct
his
countrymen
in
the
wilderness
or
where
could
he
reap
a
higher
reward
in
this
world
than
seeing
that
wilderness
growing
into
fertile
fields
under
the
hands
of
his
flock
i
never
saw
so
many
autumn
flowers
as
grow
in
the
woods
and
of
maryland
a
second
spring
seemed
to
clothe
the
fields
but
with
grief
and
shame
i
confess
that
of
these
precious
blossoms
i
scarcely
knew
a
single
name
i
think
the
michaelmas
daisy
in
wonderful
variety
of
form
and
colour
and
the
prickly
pear
were
almost
my
only
acquaintance
let
no
one
visit
america
without
having
first
studied
botany
it
is
an
amusement
as
a
clever
friend
of
mine
once
told
me
that
helps
one
wonderfully
up
and
down
hill
and
must
be
superlatively
valuable
in
america
both
from
the
plentiful
lack
of
other
amusements
and
the
plentiful
material
for
enjoyment
in
this
besides
if
one
is
dying
to
know
the
name
of
any
of
these
lovely
strangers
it
is
a
thousand
to
one
against
his
finding
any
one
who
can
tell
it
the
prettiest
eclipse
of
the
moon
i
ever
saw
was
that
of
september
of
this
year
we
had
been
passing
some
hours
amid
the
solemn
scenery
of
the
potomac
falls
and
just
as
we
were
preparing
to
quit
it
the
full
moon
arose
above
the
black
pines
with
half
our
shadow
thrown
across
her
the
effect
of
her
rising
thus
eclipsed
was
more
strange
more
striking
by
far
than
watching
the
gradual
obscuration
and
as
i
turned
to
look
at
the
black
chasm
behind
me
and
saw
the
deadly
alder
and
the
waving
darkly
on
the
rocks
around
i
thought
the
scene
wanted
nothing
but
the
figure
of
a
palsied
crone
plucking
the
fatal
branches
to
concoct
some
charm
of
mischief
whether
some
such
maga
dogged
my
steps
i
know
not
but
many
hours
had
not
elapsed
ere
i
again
felt
the
noxious
influence
of
an
american
autumn
this
fever
built
in
th
eclipse
speedily
brought
me
very
low
and
though
it
lasted
not
so
long
as
that
of
the
preceding
year
i
felt
persuaded
i
should
never
recover
from
it
though
my
forebodings
were
not
verified
by
the
event
it
was
declared
that
change
of
air
was
necessary
and
it
was
arranged
for
me
for
i
was
perfectly
incapable
of
settling
any
thing
for
myself
that
i
should
go
to
alexandria
a
pretty
town
at
the
distance
of
about
fifteen
miles
which
had
the
reputation
of
possessing
a
skilful
physician
it
was
not
without
regret
that
we
quitted
our
friends
at
stonington
but
the
prescription
proved
in
a
great
degree
efficacious
a
few
weeks
residence
in
alexandria
restored
my
strength
sufficiently
to
enable
me
to
walk
to
a
beautiful
little
grassy
terrace
perfectly
out
of
the
town
but
very
near
it
from
whence
we
could
watch
the
various
craft
that
peopled
the
potomac
between
alexandria
and
washington
but
though
gradually
regaining
strength
i
was
still
far
from
well
all
plans
for
winter
gaiety
were
abandoned
and
finding
ourselves
very
well
accommodated
we
decided
upon
passing
the
winter
where
we
were
it
proved
unusually
severe
the
potomac
was
so
completely
frozen
as
to
permit
considerable
traffic
to
be
carried
on
by
carts
crossing
on
the
ice
from
maryland
this
had
not
occurred
before
for
thirty
years
the
distance
was
a
mile
and
a
quarter
and
we
ventured
to
brave
the
cold
and
walk
across
this
bright
and
slippery
mirror
to
make
a
visit
on
the
opposite
shore
the
fatigue
of
keeping
our
feet
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
but
we
were
rewarded
by
seeing
as
noble
a
winter
landscape
around
us
as
the
eye
could
look
upon
when
at
length
the
frost
gave
way
the
melting
snow
produced
freshes
so
violent
as
to
carry
away
the
long
bridge
at
washington
large
fragments
of
it
with
the
railing
still
erect
came
floating
down
amidst
vast
blocks
of
ice
during
many
successive
days
and
it
was
curious
to
see
the
intrepidity
with
which
the
young
sailors
of
alexandria
periled
their
lives
to
make
spoil
of
the
timber
the
solar
eclipse
of
the
of
february
was
nearer
total
than
any
i
ever
saw
or
ever
shall
see
it
was
completely
annular
at
alexandria
and
the
bright
ring
which
surrounded
the
moon
shadow
though
only
in
breadth
gave
light
sufficient
to
read
the
smallest
print
the
darkness
was
considerably
lessened
by
the
snow
which
as
the
day
was
perfectly
unclouded
reflected
brightly
all
the
light
that
was
left
us
notwithstanding
the
extreme
cold
we
passed
the
whole
time
in
the
open
air
on
a
rising
ground
near
the
river
in
this
position
many
beautiful
effects
were
perceptible
the
rapid
approach
and
change
of
shadows
the
dusky
hue
of
the
broad
potomac
that
seemed
to
drink
in
the
feeble
light
which
its
banks
gave
back
to
the
air
the
gradual
change
of
every
object
from
the
colouring
of
bright
sunshine
to
one
sad
universal
tint
of
dingy
purple
the
melancholy
lowing
of
the
cattle
and
the
short
but
remarkable
suspension
of
all
labour
gave
something
of
mystery
and
awe
to
the
scene
that
we
shall
long
remember
during
the
following
months
i
occupied
myself
partly
in
revising
my
notes
and
arranging
these
pages
and
partly
in
making
myself
acquainted
as
much
as
possible
with
the
literature
of
the
country
while
reading
and
transcribing
my
notes
i
underwent
a
strict
i
passed
in
review
all
i
had
seen
all
i
had
felt
and
scrupulously
challenged
every
expression
of
disapprobation
the
result
was
that
i
omitted
in
transcription
much
that
i
had
written
as
containing
unnecessary
details
of
things
which
had
displeased
me
yet
as
i
did
so
i
felt
strongly
that
there
was
no
exaggeration
in
them
but
such
details
though
true
might
be
and
i
retained
no
more
than
were
necessary
to
convey
the
general
impressions
received
while
thus
reviewing
my
notes
i
discovered
that
many
points
which
all
scribbling
travellers
are
expected
to
notice
had
been
omitted
but
a
few
pages
of
miscellaneous
observations
will
i
think
supply
all
that
can
be
expected
from
so
idle
a
pen
chapter
american
cooking
evening
parties
dress
sleighing
habits
notice
indian
summer
anecdote
of
the
duke
of
in
relating
all
i
know
of
america
i
surely
must
not
omit
so
important
a
feature
as
the
cooking
there
are
sundry
anomalies
in
the
mode
of
serving
even
a
table
but
as
these
are
altogether
matters
of
custom
they
by
no
means
indicate
either
indifference
or
neglect
in
this
important
business
and
whether
castors
are
placed
on
the
table
or
on
the
sideboard
whether
soup
fish
patties
and
salad
be
eaten
in
orthodox
order
or
not
signifies
but
little
i
am
hardly
capable
i
fear
of
giving
a
very
erudite
critique
on
the
subject
general
observations
therefore
must
suffice
the
ordinary
mode
of
living
is
abundant
but
not
delicate
they
consume
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
bacon
ham
and
appear
morning
noon
and
night
in
eating
they
mix
things
together
with
the
strangest
incongruity
imaginable
i
have
seen
eggs
and
oysters
eaten
together
the
sempiternal
ham
with
beefsteak
with
stewed
peaches
and
salt
fish
with
onions
the
bread
is
everywhere
excellent
but
they
rarely
enjoy
it
themselves
as
they
insist
upon
eating
horrible
hot
rolls
both
morning
and
evening
the
butter
is
tolerable
but
they
have
seldom
such
cream
as
every
little
dairy
produces
in
england
in
fact
the
cows
are
very
roughly
kept
compared
with
our
common
vegetables
are
abundant
and
very
fine
i
never
saw
or
cauliflowers
and
either
from
the
want
of
summer
rain
or
the
want
of
care
the
harvest
of
green
vegetables
is
much
sooner
over
than
with
us
they
eat
the
indian
corn
in
a
great
variety
of
forms
sometimes
it
is
dressed
green
and
eaten
like
peas
sometimes
it
is
broken
to
pieces
when
dry
boiled
plain
and
brought
to
table
like
rice
this
dish
is
called
hominy
the
flour
of
it
is
made
into
at
least
a
dozen
different
sorts
of
cakes
but
in
my
opinion
all
bad
this
flour
mixed
in
the
proportion
of
with
fine
wheat
makes
by
far
the
best
bread
i
ever
tasted
i
never
saw
turbot
salmon
or
fresh
cod
but
the
rock
and
shad
are
excellent
there
is
a
great
want
of
skill
in
the
composition
of
sauces
not
only
with
fish
but
with
every
thing
they
use
very
few
made
dishes
and
i
never
saw
any
that
would
be
approved
by
our
savants
they
have
an
excellent
wild
duck
called
the
canvass
back
which
if
delicately
served
would
surpass
the
black
cock
but
the
game
is
very
inferior
to
our
they
have
no
hares
and
i
never
saw
a
pheasant
they
seldom
indulge
in
second
courses
with
all
their
ingenious
temptations
to
the
eating
a
second
dinner
but
almost
every
table
has
its
dessert
invariably
pronounced
desart
which
is
placed
on
the
table
before
the
cloth
is
removed
and
consists
of
pastry
preserved
fruits
and
creams
they
are
extravagantly
fond
to
use
their
own
phrase
of
puddings
pies
and
all
kinds
of
sweets
particularly
the
ladies
but
are
by
no
means
such
connoisseurs
in
soups
and
ragouts
as
the
gastronomes
of
europe
almost
every
one
drinks
water
at
table
and
by
a
strange
contradiction
in
the
country
where
hard
drinking
is
more
prevalent
than
in
any
other
there
is
less
wine
taken
at
dinner
ladies
rarely
exceed
one
glass
and
the
great
majority
of
females
never
take
any
in
fact
the
hard
drinking
so
universally
acknowledged
does
not
take
place
at
jovial
dinners
but
to
speak
plain
english
in
solitary
coffee
is
not
served
immediately
after
dinner
but
makes
part
of
the
serious
matter
of
which
comes
some
hours
later
mixed
dinner
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
very
rare
and
unless
several
foreigners
are
present
but
little
conversation
passes
at
table
it
certainly
does
not
in
my
opinion
add
to
the
well
ordering
a
dinner
table
to
set
the
gentlemen
at
one
end
of
it
and
the
ladies
at
the
other
but
it
is
very
rarely
that
you
find
it
otherwise
their
large
evening
parties
are
supremely
dull
the
men
sometimes
play
cards
by
themselves
but
if
a
lady
plays
it
must
not
be
for
money
no
ecarte
no
chess
very
little
music
and
that
little
lamentably
bad
among
the
blacks
i
heard
some
good
voices
singing
in
tune
but
i
scarcely
ever
heard
a
white
american
male
or
female
go
through
an
air
without
being
out
of
tune
before
the
end
of
it
nor
did
i
ever
meet
any
trace
of
science
in
the
singing
i
heard
in
society
to
eat
inconceivable
quantities
of
cake
ice
and
pickled
oysters
and
to
show
half
their
revenue
in
silks
and
satins
seem
to
be
the
chief
object
they
have
in
these
parties
the
most
agreeable
meetings
i
was
assured
by
all
the
young
people
were
those
to
which
no
married
women
are
admitted
of
the
truth
of
this
statement
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
these
exclusive
meetings
occur
frequently
and
often
last
to
a
late
hour
on
these
occasions
i
believe
they
generally
dance
at
regular
balls
married
ladies
are
admitted
but
seldom
take
much
part
in
the
amusement
the
refreshments
are
always
profuse
and
costly
but
taken
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
i
have
known
many
private
balls
where
every
thing
was
on
the
most
liberal
scale
of
expense
where
the
gentlemen
sat
down
to
supper
in
one
room
while
the
ladies
took
theirs
standing
in
another
what
we
call
picnics
are
very
rare
and
when
attempted
do
not
often
succeed
well
the
two
sexes
can
hardly
mix
for
the
greater
part
of
a
day
without
great
restraint
and
ennui
it
is
quite
contrary
to
their
general
habits
the
favourite
indulgences
of
the
gentlemen
smoking
cigars
and
drinking
spirits
can
neither
be
indulged
in
with
decency
nor
resigned
with
complacency
the
ladies
have
strange
ways
of
adding
to
their
charms
they
powder
themselves
immoderately
face
neck
and
arms
with
pulverised
starch
the
effect
is
indescribably
disagreeable
by
daylight
and
not
very
favourable
at
any
time
they
are
also
most
unhappily
partial
to
false
hair
which
they
wear
in
surprising
quantities
this
is
the
more
to
be
lamented
as
they
generally
have
very
fine
hair
of
their
own
i
suspect
this
fashion
to
arise
from
an
indolent
mode
of
making
their
toilet
and
from
accomplished
ladies
maids
not
being
very
abundant
it
is
less
trouble
to
append
a
bunch
of
waving
curls
here
there
and
every
where
than
to
keep
their
native
tresses
in
perfect
order
though
the
expense
of
the
ladies
dress
greatly
exceeds
in
proportion
to
their
general
style
of
living
that
of
the
ladies
of
europe
it
is
very
far
excepting
in
philadelphia
from
being
in
good
taste
they
do
not
consult
the
seasons
in
the
colours
or
in
the
style
of
their
costume
i
have
often
shivered
at
seeing
a
young
beauty
picking
her
way
through
the
snow
with
a
pale
bonnet
set
on
the
very
top
of
her
head
i
knew
one
young
lady
whose
pretty
little
ear
was
actually
frostbitten
from
being
thus
exposed
they
never
wear
muffs
or
boots
and
appear
extremely
shocked
at
the
sight
of
comfortable
walking
shoes
and
cotton
stockings
even
when
they
have
to
step
to
their
sleighs
over
ice
and
snow
they
walk
in
the
middle
of
winter
with
their
poor
little
toes
pinched
into
a
miniature
slipper
incapable
of
excluding
as
much
moisture
as
might
bedew
a
primrose
i
must
say
in
their
excuse
however
that
they
have
almost
universally
extremely
pretty
feet
they
do
not
walk
well
nor
in
fact
do
they
ever
appear
to
advantage
when
in
movement
i
know
not
why
this
should
be
for
they
have
abundance
of
french
among
them
but
somehow
or
other
it
is
the
fact
i
fancied
i
could
often
trace
a
mixture
of
affectation
and
of
shyness
in
their
little
mincing
unsteady
step
and
the
ever
changing
position
of
the
hands
they
do
not
dance
well
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
they
do
not
look
well
when
dancing
lovely
as
their
faces
are
they
can
not
in
a
position
that
exhibits
the
whole
person
atone
for
the
want
of
and
for
the
universal
defect
in
the
formation
of
the
bust
which
is
rarely
full
or
gracefully
formed
i
never
saw
an
american
man
walk
or
stand
well
notwithstanding
their
frequent
militia
drillings
they
are
nearly
all
hollow
chested
and
round
shouldered
perhaps
this
is
occasioned
by
no
officer
daring
to
say
to
a
brother
hold
up
your
head
whatever
the
cause
the
effect
is
very
remarkable
to
a
stranger
in
stature
and
in
physiognomy
a
great
majority
of
the
population
both
male
and
female
are
strikingly
handsome
but
they
know
not
how
to
do
their
own
honours
half
as
much
comeliness
elsewhere
would
produce
ten
times
as
much
effect
nothing
can
exceed
their
activity
and
perseverance
in
all
kinds
of
speculation
handicraft
and
enterprise
which
promises
a
profitable
pecuniary
result
i
heard
an
englishman
who
had
been
long
resident
in
america
declare
that
in
following
in
meeting
or
in
overtaking
in
the
street
on
the
road
or
in
the
field
at
the
theatre
the
or
at
home
he
had
never
overheard
americans
conversing
without
the
word
dollar
being
pronounced
between
them
such
unity
of
purpose
such
sympathy
of
feeling
can
i
believe
be
found
nowhere
else
except
perhaps
in
an
ants
nest
the
result
is
exactly
what
might
be
anticipated
this
sordid
object
for
ever
before
their
eyes
must
inevitably
produce
a
sordid
tone
of
mind
and
worse
still
it
produces
a
seared
and
blunted
conscience
on
all
questions
of
probity
i
know
not
a
more
striking
evidence
of
the
low
tone
of
morality
which
is
generated
by
this
universal
pursuit
of
money
than
the
manner
in
which
the
new
england
states
are
described
by
americans
all
agree
in
saying
that
they
present
a
spectacle
of
industry
and
prosperity
delightful
to
behold
and
this
is
the
district
and
the
population
most
constantly
quoted
as
the
finest
specimen
of
their
admirable
country
yet
i
never
met
a
single
individual
in
any
part
of
the
union
who
did
not
paint
these
new
englanders
as
sly
grinding
selfish
and
tricking
the
yankees
as
the
new
englanders
are
called
will
avow
these
qualities
themselves
with
a
complacent
smile
and
boast
that
no
people
on
the
earth
can
match
them
at
over
reaching
in
a
bargain
i
have
heard
them
unblushingly
relate
stories
of
their
cronies
and
friends
which
if
believed
among
us
would
banish
the
heroes
from
the
fellowship
of
honest
men
for
ever
and
all
this
is
uttered
with
a
simplicity
which
sometimes
led
me
to
doubt
if
the
speakers
knew
what
honour
and
honesty
meant
yet
the
americans
declare
that
they
are
the
most
moral
people
upon
earth
again
and
again
i
have
heard
this
asserted
not
only
in
conversation
and
by
their
writings
but
even
from
the
pulpit
such
broad
assumption
of
superior
virtue
demands
examination
and
after
four
years
of
attentive
and
earnest
observation
and
enquiry
my
honest
conviction
is
that
the
standard
of
moral
character
in
the
united
states
is
very
greatly
lower
than
in
europe
of
their
religion
as
it
appears
outwardly
i
have
had
occasion
to
speak
frequently
i
pretend
not
to
judge
the
heart
but
without
any
uncharitable
presumption
i
must
take
permission
to
say
that
both
protestant
england
and
catholic
france
show
an
infinitely
superior
religious
and
moral
aspect
to
mortal
observation
both
as
to
reverend
decency
of
external
observance
and
as
to
the
inward
fruit
of
honest
dealing
between
man
and
man
in
other
respects
i
think
no
one
will
be
disappointed
who
visits
the
country
expecting
to
find
no
more
than
common
sense
might
teach
him
to
look
for
namely
a
vast
continent
by
far
the
greater
part
of
which
is
still
in
the
state
in
which
nature
left
it
and
a
busy
bustling
industrious
population
hacking
and
hewing
their
way
through
it
what
greatly
increases
the
interest
of
this
spectacle
is
the
wonderful
facility
for
internal
commerce
furnished
by
the
rivers
lakes
and
canals
which
thread
the
country
in
every
direction
producing
a
rapidity
of
progress
in
all
commercial
and
agricultural
speculation
altogether
unequalled
this
remarkable
feature
is
perceptible
in
every
part
of
the
union
into
which
the
fast
spreading
population
has
hitherto
found
its
way
and
forms
i
think
the
most
remarkable
and
interesting
peculiarity
of
the
country
i
hardly
remember
a
single
town
where
vessels
of
some
description
or
other
may
not
constantly
be
seen
in
full
activity
their
carriages
of
every
kind
are
very
unlike
ours
those
belonging
to
private
individuals
seem
all
constructed
with
a
view
to
summer
use
for
which
they
are
extremely
well
calculated
but
they
are
by
no
means
comfortable
in
winter
the
waggons
and
cars
are
built
with
great
strength
which
is
indeed
necessary
from
the
roads
they
often
have
to
encounter
the
stagecoaches
are
heavier
and
much
less
comfortable
than
those
of
france
to
those
of
england
they
can
bear
no
comparison
i
never
saw
any
harness
that
i
could
call
handsome
nor
any
equipage
which
as
to
horses
carriage
harness
and
servants
could
be
considered
as
complete
the
sleighs
are
delightful
and
constructed
at
so
little
expense
that
i
wonder
we
have
not
all
got
them
in
england
lying
by
in
waiting
for
the
snow
which
often
remains
with
us
long
enough
to
permit
their
use
sleighing
is
much
more
generally
enjoyed
by
night
than
by
day
for
what
reason
i
could
never
discover
unless
it
be
that
no
gentlemen
are
to
be
found
disengaged
from
business
in
the
mornings
nothing
certainly
can
be
more
agreeable
than
the
gliding
smoothly
and
rapidly
along
deep
sunk
in
soft
furs
the
moon
shining
with
almost
midday
splendour
the
air
of
crystal
brightness
and
the
snow
sparkling
on
every
side
as
if
it
were
sprinkled
with
diamonds
and
then
the
noiseless
movement
of
the
horses
so
mysterious
and
unwonted
and
the
gentle
tinkling
of
the
bells
you
meet
and
carry
all
help
at
once
to
soothe
and
excite
the
spirits
in
short
i
had
not
the
least
objection
to
sleighing
by
night
i
only
wished
to
sleigh
by
day
also
almost
every
resident
in
the
country
has
a
carriage
they
call
a
carryall
which
name
i
suspect
to
be
a
corruption
of
the
cariole
so
often
mentioned
in
the
pretty
canadian
story
of
emily
montagu
it
is
clumsy
enough
certainly
but
extremely
convenient
and
admirably
calculated
with
its
thick
roof
and
moveable
draperies
for
every
kind
of
summer
excursion
their
were
the
social
arrangements
somewhat
improved
would
be
delightful
as
a
mode
of
travelling
but
they
are
very
seldom
employed
for
excursions
of
mere
amusement
nor
do
i
remember
seeing
properly
so
called
at
any
of
the
numerous
places
where
they
might
be
used
with
so
much
safety
and
enjoyment
how
often
did
our
homely
adage
recur
to
me
all
work
and
no
play
would
make
jack
a
dull
boy
jonathan
is
a
very
dull
boy
we
are
by
no
means
so
gay
as
our
lively
neighbours
on
the
other
side
the
channel
but
compared
with
americans
we
are
whirligigs
and
tetotums
every
day
is
a
holyday
and
every
night
a
festival
perhaps
if
the
ladies
had
quite
their
own
way
a
little
more
relaxation
would
be
permitted
but
there
is
one
remarkable
peculiarity
in
their
manners
which
precludes
the
possibility
of
any
dangerous
outbreaking
of
the
kind
few
ladies
have
any
command
of
ready
money
entrusted
to
them
i
have
been
a
hundred
times
present
when
bills
for
a
few
dollars
perhaps
for
one
have
been
brought
for
payment
to
ladies
living
in
perfectly
easy
circumstances
who
have
declared
themselves
without
money
and
referred
the
claimant
to
their
husbands
for
payment
on
every
occasion
where
immediate
disbursement
is
required
it
is
the
same
even
in
shopping
for
ready
cash
they
say
send
a
bill
home
with
the
things
and
my
husband
will
give
you
a
draft
i
think
that
it
was
during
my
stay
at
washington
that
i
was
informed
of
a
government
regulation
which
appeared
to
me
curious
i
therefore
record
it
here
every
deputy
is
required
to
insert
in
his
return
the
title
of
every
newspaper
received
at
his
office
for
distribution
this
return
is
laid
before
the
secretary
of
state
who
perfectly
knowing
the
political
character
of
each
newspaper
is
thus
enabled
to
feel
the
pulse
of
every
limb
of
the
monster
mob
this
is
a
well
imagined
device
for
getting
a
peep
at
the
politics
of
a
country
where
newspapers
make
part
of
the
daily
food
but
is
it
quite
consistent
with
their
entire
freedom
i
do
not
believe
we
have
any
such
tricks
to
regulate
the
disposal
of
offices
and
appointments
i
believe
it
was
in
indiana
that
met
with
a
printed
notice
relative
to
the
payment
of
taxes
which
i
preserved
as
a
curious
sample
of
the
manner
in
which
the
free
citizens
are
coaxed
and
reasoned
into
obeying
the
laws
look
out
delinquents
those
indebted
to
me
for
taxes
fees
notes
and
accounts
are
specially
requested
to
call
and
pay
the
same
on
or
before
the
day
of
december
as
no
longer
indulgence
will
be
given
i
have
called
time
and
again
by
advertisement
and
otherwise
to
little
effect
but
now
the
time
has
come
when
my
situation
requires
immediate
payment
from
all
indebted
to
me
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
pay
off
the
amount
of
the
duplicates
of
taxes
and
my
other
debts
without
recovering
the
same
of
those
from
whom
it
is
due
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
the
reason
why
those
charged
with
taxes
neglect
to
pay
from
the
negligence
of
many
it
would
seem
that
they
think
the
money
is
mine
or
i
have
funds
to
discharge
the
taxes
due
to
the
state
and
that
i
can
wait
with
them
until
it
suits
their
convenience
to
pay
the
money
is
not
mine
neither
have
i
the
funds
to
settle
amount
of
the
duplicate
my
only
resort
is
to
collect
in
doing
so
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
resort
to
the
authority
given
me
by
law
for
the
recovery
of
the
same
it
should
be
the
first
object
of
every
good
citizen
to
pay
his
taxes
for
it
is
in
that
way
government
is
supported
why
are
taxes
assessed
unless
they
are
collected
depend
upon
it
i
shall
proceed
to
collect
agreeably
to
law
so
govern
yourselves
accordingly
john
spencer
and
collector
nov
on
thursday
the
inst
clair
and
geo
dunn
esqrs
depart
for
indianopolis
i
wish
as
many
as
can
pay
to
do
so
to
enable
me
to
forward
as
much
as
possible
to
save
the
per
cent
that
will
be
charged
against
me
after
the
of
december
next
js
the
first
autumn
i
passed
in
america
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
great
and
very
oppressive
return
of
heat
accompanied
with
a
heavy
mistiness
in
the
air
long
after
the
summer
heats
were
over
when
this
state
of
the
atmosphere
comes
on
they
say
we
have
got
to
the
indian
summer
on
desiring
to
have
this
phrase
explained
i
was
told
that
the
phenomenon
described
as
the
was
occasioned
by
the
indians
setting
fire
to
the
woods
which
spread
heat
and
smoke
to
a
great
distance
but
i
afterwards
met
with
the
following
explanation
which
appears
to
me
much
more
reasonable
the
indian
summer
is
so
called
because
at
the
particular
period
of
the
year
in
which
it
obtains
the
indians
break
up
their
village
communities
and
go
to
the
interior
to
prepare
for
their
winter
hunting
this
season
seems
to
mark
a
dividing
line
between
the
heat
of
summer
and
the
cold
of
winter
and
is
from
its
mildness
suited
to
these
migrations
the
cause
of
this
heat
is
the
slow
combustion
of
the
leaves
and
other
vegetable
matter
of
the
boundless
and
interminable
forests
those
who
at
this
season
of
the
year
have
penetrated
these
forests
know
all
about
it
to
the
feet
the
heat
is
quite
sensible
whilst
the
ascending
vapour
warms
every
thing
it
embraces
and
spreading
out
into
the
wide
atmosphere
fills
the
circuit
of
the
heavens
with
its
peculiar
heat
and
smokiness
this
unnatural
heat
sufficiently
accounts
for
the
sickliness
of
the
american
autumn
the
effect
of
it
is
extremely
distressing
to
the
nerves
even
when
the
general
health
continues
good
to
me
it
was
infinitely
more
disagreeable
than
the
glowing
heat
of
the
a
short
time
before
we
arrived
in
america
the
duke
of
made
a
tour
of
the
united
states
i
heard
many
persons
speak
of
his
unaffected
and
amiable
manners
yet
he
could
not
escape
the
dislike
which
every
trace
of
gentlemanly
feeling
is
sure
to
create
among
the
ordinary
class
of
americans
as
an
amusing
instance
of
this
i
made
the
following
extract
from
a
newspaper
a
correspondent
of
the
charlestown
gazette
tells
an
anecdote
connected
with
the
duke
of
recent
journey
through
our
country
which
we
do
not
recollect
to
have
heard
before
although
some
such
story
is
told
of
the
veritable
capt
basil
hall
the
scene
occurred
on
the
route
between
augusta
and
milledgeville
it
seems
that
the
sagacious
duke
engaged
three
or
four
or
more
seats
in
the
regular
stage
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
suite
and
thought
by
this
that
he
had
secured
the
monopoly
of
the
vehicle
not
so
however
a
traveller
came
along
and
entered
his
name
upon
the
book
and
secured
his
seat
by
payment
of
the
customary
charges
to
the
duke
great
surprise
on
entering
the
stage
he
found
our
traveller
comfortably
housed
in
one
of
the
most
eligible
seats
wrapt
up
in
his
and
snoring
like
a
buffalo
the
duke
greatly
irritated
called
for
the
question
of
consideration
he
demanded
in
broken
english
the
cause
of
the
gross
intrusion
and
insisted
in
a
very
princely
manner
though
not
it
seems
in
very
princely
language
upon
the
incumbent
vacating
the
seat
in
which
he
had
made
himself
so
impudently
at
home
but
the
duke
had
yet
to
learn
his
first
lesson
of
republicanism
the
driver
was
one
of
those
sturdy
southrons
who
can
always
and
at
a
moment
warning
whip
his
weight
in
wild
cats
and
he
as
resolutely
told
the
duke
that
the
traveller
was
as
good
if
not
a
better
man
than
himself
and
that
no
alteration
of
the
existing
arrangement
could
be
permitted
became
violent
at
this
opposition
so
unlike
any
to
which
his
education
hitherto
had
ever
subjected
him
and
threatened
john
with
the
application
of
the
bamboo
this
was
one
of
those
threats
which
in
georgia
dialect
would
subject
a
man
to
a
rowing
up
salt
river
and
accordingly
down
leaped
our
driver
from
his
box
and
peeling
himself
for
the
combat
he
leaped
about
the
vehicle
in
the
most
style
calling
upon
the
prince
of
a
five
acre
patch
to
put
his
threat
in
execution
but
he
of
the
star
refused
to
make
up
issue
in
the
way
suggested
contenting
himself
with
assuring
the
enraged
southron
of
a
complaint
to
his
excellency
the
governor
on
arriving
at
the
seat
of
government
this
threat
was
almost
as
unlucky
as
the
former
for
it
wrought
the
individual
for
whom
it
was
intended
into
that
species
of
fury
which
through
discriminating
in
its
madness
is
nevertheless
without
much
limit
in
its
violence
and
he
swore
that
the
governor
might
go
to
and
for
his
part
he
would
just
as
leave
lick
the
governor
as
the
duke
he
like
no
better
fun
than
to
give
both
duke
and
governor
a
dressing
in
the
same
breath
could
do
it
he
had
little
doubt
and
instigating
one
fist
to
diverge
into
the
face
of
the
marvelling
and
nobleman
with
the
other
he
thrust
him
down
into
a
seat
alongside
the
traveller
whose
presence
had
been
originally
of
such
sore
discomfort
to
his
excellency
and
bidding
the
attendants
jump
in
with
their
discomfited
master
he
mounted
his
box
in
triumph
and
went
on
his
journey
i
fully
believe
that
this
brutal
history
would
be
as
distasteful
to
the
travelled
and
polished
few
who
are
to
be
found
scattered
through
the
union
as
it
is
to
me
but
if
they
do
not
deem
the
of
such
a
scene
to
be
a
national
degradation
i
differ
from
them
the
american
people
speaking
of
the
great
mass
have
no
more
idea
of
what
constitutes
the
difference
between
this
prince
of
a
five
acre
patch
and
themselves
than
a
has
of
estimating
the
points
of
the
elegant
victor
of
the
could
the
speak
when
expected
to
yield
the
daintiest
stall
to
his
graceful
rival
he
would
say
a
horse
is
a
horse
and
is
it
not
with
the
same
logic
that
the
transatlantic
houynnhnm
puts
down
all
superiority
with
a
man
is
a
man
this
story
justifies
the
reply
of
talleyrand
when
asked
by
napoleon
what
he

chapter

fine

the
character
of
the
american
literature
is
generally
speaking
pretty
justly
appreciated
in
europe
the
immense
exhalation
of
periodical
trash
which
penetrates
into
every
cot
and
corner
of
the
country
and
which
is
greedily
sucked
in
by
all
ranks
is
unquestionably
one
great
cause
of
its
inferiority
where
newspapers
are
the
principal
vehicles
of
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
a
people
the
higher
graces
of
composition
can
hardly
be
looked
for
that
there
are
many
among
them
who
can
write
well
is
most
certain
but
it
is
at
least
equally
so
that
they
have
little
encouragement
to
exercise
the
power
in
any
manner
more
dignified
than
becoming
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
or
a
magazine
as
far
as
i
could
judge
their
best
writers
are
far
from
being
the
most
popular
the
general
taste
is
decidedly
bad
this
is
obvious
not
only
from
the
mass
of
poured
forth
by
the
daily
and
weekly
press
but
from
the
inflated
tone
of
eulogy
in
which
their
insect
authors
are
lauded
to
an
american
writer
i
should
think
it
must
be
a
flattering
distinction
to
escape
the
admiration
of
the
newspapers
few
persons
of
taste
i
imagine
would
like
such
notice
as
the
following
which
i
copied
from
a
new
york
paper
where
it
followed
the
advertisement
of
a
partnership
volume
of
poems
by
a
mr
and
brooks
but
of
such
are
their
literary
notices
chiefly
composed
the
lovers
of
impassioned
and
classical
numbers
may
promise
themselves
much
gratification
from
the
muse
of
brooks
while
the
harp
of
his
lady
the
norna
of
the
courier
harp
which
none
but
she
can
touch
has
a
chord
for
every
heart
another
obvious
cause
of
inferiority
in
the
national
literature
is
the
very
slight
acquaintance
with
the
best
models
of
composition
which
is
thought
necessary
for
persons
called
well
educated
there
may
be
reason
for
deprecating
the
lavish
expense
of
time
bestowed
in
england
on
the
acquirement
of
latin
and
greek
and
it
may
be
doubtful
whether
the
power
of
composing
in
these
languages
with
correctness
and
facility
be
worth
all
the
labour
it
costs
but
as
long
as
letters
shall
be
left
on
the
earth
the
utility
of
a
perfect
familiarity
with
the
exquisite
models
of
antiquity
can
not
be
doubted
i
think
i
run
no
risk
of
contradiction
when
i
say
that
an
extremely
small
proportion
of
the
higher
classes
in
america
possess
this
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
classics
it
is
vain
to
suppose
that
translations
may
suffice
noble
as
are
the
thoughts
the
ancients
have
left
us
their
power
of
expression
is
infinitely
more
important
as
a
study
to
modern
writers
and
this
no
translation
can
furnish
nor
did
it
appear
to
me
that
their
intimacy
with
modern
literature
was
such
as
to
assist
them
much
in
the
formation
of
style
what
they
class
as
modern
literature
seems
to
include
little
beyond
the
english
publications
of
the
day
to
speak
of
chaucer
or
even
spenser
as
a
modern
appears
to
them
inexpressibly
ridiculous
and
all
the
rich
and
varied
eloquence
of
italy
from
dante
to
monti
is
about
as
much
known
to
them
as
the
welsh
effusions
of
urien
and
modred
to
us
rousseau
voltaire
diderot
were
read
by
the
old
federalists
but
now
they
seem
known
more
as
naughty
words
than
as
great
names
i
am
much
mistaken
if
a
hundred
untravelled
americans
could
be
found
who
have
read
boileau
or
le
fontaine
still
fewer
are
acquainted
with
that
delightful
host
of
french
female
writers
whose
memoirs
and
letters
sparkle
in
every
page
with
unequalled
felicity
of
style
the
literature
of
spain
and
portugal
is
no
better
known
and
as
for
the
wits
of
queen
day
they
are
laid
upon
a
shelf
in
some
score
of
very
houses
together
with
sherlock
and
taylor
as
much
too
antiquated
to
suit
the
immensely
rapid
progress
of
mind
which
distinguishes
america
the
most
perfect
examples
of
english
writing
either
of
our
own
or
of
any
former
day
have
assuredly
not
been
produced
by
the
imitation
of
any
particular
style
but
the
fairy
queen
would
hardly
have
been
written
if
the
orlando
had
not
nor
would
milton
have
been
the
perfect
poet
he
was
had
virgil
and
tasso
been
unknown
to
him
it
is
not
that
the
scholar
mimics
in
writing
the
phrases
he
has
read
but
that
he
can
neither
think
feel
nor
express
himself
as
he
might
have
done
had
his
mental
companionship
been
of
a
lower
order
they
are
great
novel
readers
but
the
market
is
chiefly
furnished
by
england
they
have
however
a
few
very
good
native
novels
flint
francis
berrian
is
delightful
there
is
a
vigor
and
freshness
in
his
writing
that
is
exactly
in
accordance
with
what
one
looks
for
in
the
literature
of
a
new
country
and
yet
strange
to
say
it
is
exactly
what
is
most
wanting
in
that
of
america
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
style
of
their
imaginative
compositions
was
almost
always
affected
and
inflated
even
in
treating
their
great
national
subject
of
romance
the
indians
they
are
seldom
either
powerful
or
original
a
few
well
known
general
features
moral
and
physical
are
presented
over
and
over
again
in
all
their
indian
stories
till
in
reading
them
you
lose
all
sense
of
individual
character
flint
history
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
a
work
of
great
interest
and
information
and
will
i
hope
in
time
find
its
way
to
england
where
i
think
it
is
much
more
likely
to
be
appreciated
than
in
america
channing
is
a
writer
too
well
known
in
england
to
require
my
testimony
to
his
great
ability
as
a
preacher
he
has
perhaps
hardly
a
rival
any
where
this
gentleman
is
an
unitarian
and
i
was
informed
by
several
persons
well
acquainted
with
the
literary
character
of
the
country
that
nearly
all
their
distinguished
men
were
of
this
persuasion
pierpoint
is
a
very
eloquent
preacher
and
a
sweet
poet
his
works
are
not
so
well
known
among
us
as
ought
to
be
everett
has
written
some
beautiful
lines
and
if
i
may
judge
from
the
specimens
of
his
speeches
as
preserved
in
the
volumes
intitled
eloquence
of
the
united
states
i
should
say
that
he
shone
more
as
a
poet
than
an
orator
but
american
fame
has
decided
otherwise
flint
of
louisiana
has
published
a
volume
of
poems
which
ought
to
be
naturalised
here
hallock
of
new
york
has
much
facility
of
versification
and
is
greatly
in
fashion
as
a
poet
but
i
think
he
has
somewhat
too
much
respect
for
himself
and
too
little
for
his
readers
it
is
i
think
bryant
who
ranks
highest
as
the
poet
of
the
union
this
is
too
lofty
an
eminence
for
me
to
attack
besides
i
am
of
another
parish
and
therefore
perhaps
no
very
fair
judge
from
miscellaneous
poetry
i
made
a
great
many
extracts
but
upon
returning
to
them
for
transcription
i
thought
that
and
dulness
pair
would
be
more
served
by
their
insertion
than
wholesome
criticism
the
massive
fredoniad
of
emmons
in
forty
cantos
i
never
read
but
as
i
did
not
meet
a
single
native
who
had
i
hope
this
want
of
poetical
enterprise
will
be
excused
they
have
very
few
native
tragedies
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
i
believe
and
those
of
very
recent
date
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
fall
heavily
upon
these
the
attempt
alone
nearly
the
most
arduous
a
poet
can
make
is
of
itself
honourable
and
the
success
at
least
equal
to
that
in
any
other
department
of
literature
paulding

popular

of

washington
irving

cooper
have
so
decidedly
chosen
another
field
whereon
to
reap
their
laurels
that
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
name
them
here
i
am
not
of
course
competent
to
form
any
opinion
of
their
scientific
works
but
some
papers
which
i
read
almost
accidentally
appeared
to
me
to
be
written
with
great
clearness
and
neatness
of
definition
it
appears
extraordinary
that
a
people
who
loudly
declare
their
respect
for
science
should
be
entirely
without
observatories
neither
at
their
seats
of
learning
nor
in
their
cities
does
any
thing
of
the
kind
exist
nor
did
i
in
any
direction
hear

individuals
given
to
the
study
of

i
had
not
the
pleasure
of
making
any
acquaintance
with
bowditch
of
boston

i
know
that
this

ranks
very
high
as
a
mathematician

the
estimation
of
the

posthumous
works
were
very
generally
circulated
whilst
i
was
in

they
are
a
mighty
mass
of
mischief
he
wrote
with
more
perspicuity
than
he
thought
and
his
democracy
has
done
a
fearful
injury
to
his
country
hollow
and
unsound
as
his
doctrines
are
they
are
but
too
palatable
to
a
people
each
individual
of
whom
would
rather
derive
his
importance
from
believing
that
none
are
above
him
than
from
the
consciousness
that
in
his
station
he
makes
part
of
a
noble
whole
the
social
system
of
jefferson
if
carried
into
effect
would
make
of
mankind
an
unamalgamated
mass
of
grating
atoms
where
the

as
good
as
you
would
soon
take
place
of
the
law
and
the
gospel
as
it
is
his
principles
though
happily
not
fully
put
in
action
have
yet
produced
most
lamentable
results
the
assumption
of
equality
however
empty
is
sufficient
to
tincture
the
manners
of
the
poor
with
brutal
insolence
and
subjects
the
rich
to
the
paltry
expediency
of
sanctioning
the
falsehood
however
deep
their
conviction
that
it
is
such
it
can
not
i
think
be
denied
that
the
great
men
of
america
attain
to
power
and
to
fame
by
eternally
uttering
what
they
know
to
be
untrue
american
citizens
are
not
equal
did
washington
feel
them
to
be
so
when
his
word
outweighed
so
happily
for
them
the
votes
of
thousands
did
franklin
think
that
all
were
equal
when
he
shouldered
his
way
from
the
printing
press
to
the
cabinet
true
he
looked
back
in
high
good
humour
and
with
his
kindest
smile
told
the
poor
devils
whom
he
left
behind
that
they
were
all
his
equals
but
franklin
did
not
speak
the
truth
and
he
knew
it
the
great
the
immortal
jefferson
himself
he
who
when
past
the
three
score
years
and
ten
still
taught
young
females
to
obey
his
nod
and
so
became
the
father
of
unnumbered
generations
of
groaning
slaves
what
was
his
matin
and
his
vesper
hymn
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
did
the
venerable
father
of
the
gang
believe
it
or
did
he
too
purchase
his
immortality
by
a
lie
from
the
five
heavy
volumes
of
the
eloquence
of
the
united
states
i
made
a
few
extracts
which
i
give
more
for
the
sake
of
their
political
interest
than
for
any
purpose
of

criticism
hancock

of
those
venerated
men
who
signed

but
if
i
was
possessed
of
the
gift
of
prophecy
i
dare
not
except
by
divine
command
unfold
the
leaves
on
which
the
destiny
of
that
once
powerful
kingdom
is
inscribed
it
is
impossible
not
to
regret
that
hancock

thus
have

dare

it
would
have
been
exceedingly
edifying
to
have

all
the
terrible

the

we
see
a
harshness
of
individual
character
in
the
general
view
of
it
which
is
perceived
and
acknowledged
by
all
europe
a
spirit
of
unbecoming
censure
as
regards
all
customs
and
institutions
not
their
own
a
ferocity
in
some
of
their
characteristics
of
national
manners
pervading
their
very
pastimes
which
no
other
modern
people
are
endued
with
the
blunted
sensibility
to
bear
an
universal
superiority
not
innocently
manifesting
itself
in
speculative
sentiments
among
themselves
but
unamiably
indulged
when
with
foreigners
of
whatever
description
in
their
own
country
or
when
they
themselves
are
the
temporary
sojourners
in
a
foreign
country
a
code
of
criminal
law
that
forgets
to
feel
for
human
frailty
that
sports
with
human
misfortune
that
has
shed
more
blood
in
deliberate
judicial
severity
for
two
centuries
past
constantly
increasing
too
in
its
sanguinary
hue
than
has
ever
been
sanctioned
by
the
jurisprudence
of
any
ancient
or
modern
nation
civilized
and
refined
like
herself
the
merciless
whippings
in
her
army
peculiar
to
herself
alone
the
conspicuous
commission
and
freest
acknowledgment
of
vice
in
the
upper
classes
the
overweening
distinctions
shown
to
opulence
and
birth
so
destructive
of
a
sound
moral
sentiment
in
the
nation
so
baffling
to
virtue
these
are
some
of
the
traits
that
rise
up
to
a
contemplation
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
isle
where
is
the
alchymy
that
can
extract
from
captain
hall
work
one
thousandth
part
of
the
contained
in
this
one
passage
yet
america
has
resounded
from
shore
to
shore
with
execrations
against
his
barbarous
calumnies
but
now
we
will
listen
to
another
tone
let
us
see
how
americans
can
praise
everett
in
a
recent
of
july
oration
speaks
thus
we
are
authorised
to
assert
that
the
era
of
our
independence
dates
the
establishment
of
the
only
perfect
organization
of
government
again
our
government
is
in
its
theory
perfect
and
in
its
operation
it
is
perfect
also
thus
we
have
solved
the
great
problem
in
human
affairs
and
again
a
frame
of
government
perfect
in
its
principles
has
been
brought
down
from
the
airy
regions
of
utopia
and
has
found
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
in
our
country
among
my
miscellaneous
reading
i
got
hold
of
an
american
publication
giving
a
detailed
and
indeed
an
official
account
of
the
capture
of
washington
by
the
british
in
an
event
so
long
past
and
of
so
little
ultimate
importance
is
perhaps
hardly
worth
alluding
to
but
there
are
some
passages
in
the
official
documents
which
i
thought
very
amusing
at
the
very
moment
of
receiving
the
attack
of
the
british
on
the
heights
of
bladensburgh
there
seems
to
have
been
a
most
curious
puzzle
among
the
american
generals
as
to
where
they
were
to
be
stationed
and
what
they
were
to
do
it
is
stated
that
the
british
threw
themselves
forward
in
open
order
advancing
singly
the
american
general
winden
goes
on
in
his
narrative
to
describe
what
followed
thus
our
advanced
riflemen
now
began
to
fire
and
continued
it
for
half
a
dozen
rounds
when
i
observed
them
to
run
back
to
an
orchard
they
halted
there
and
seemed
for
a
moment
about
returning
to
their
original
position
but
in
a
few
moments
entirely
broke
and
retired
to
the
left
of
stansburg
line
the
advanced
artillery
immediately
followed
the
riflemen
the
first
three
or
four
rockets
fired
by
the
enemy
were
much
above
the
heads
of
stansburg
line
but
the
rockets
having
taken
a
more
horizontal
direction
an
universal
flight
of
the
centre
and
left
of
this
brigade
was
the
consequence
the
regiment
and
the
artillery
still
remained
and
i
hoped
would
prevent
the
enemy
approach
but
they
advancing
singly
their
fire
annoyed
the
considerably
when
i
ordered
it
to
retire
to
put
it
out
of
the
reach
of
the
enemy
this
order
was
however
immediately
countermanded
from
an
aversion
to
retire
before
the
necessity
became
stronger
and
from
a
hope
that
the
enemy
would
issue
in
a
body
and
enable
us
to
act
upon
him
on
terms
of
equality
but
the
enemy
fire
beginning
to
annoy
the
still
more
by
wounding
several
of
them
and
a
strong
column
passing
up
the
road
and
deploying
on
its
left
i
ordered
them
to
retire
their
retreat
became
a
flight
of
absolute
and
total
disorder
of
beall
regiment
the
general
gives
the
following
succinct
account
it
gave
one
or
two
ineffectual
fires
and
fled
in
another
place
he
says
piteously
the
cavalry
would
do
any
thing
but
charge
general
armstrong
gentle
and
metaphysical
account
of
the
business
was
that
without
all
doubt
the
determining
cause
of
our
disasters
is
to
be
found
in
the
love
of
life
this
affair
at
washington
which
in
its
result
was
certainly
advantageous
to
america
inasmuch
as
it
caused
the
present
beautiful
capitol
to
be
built
in
the
place
of
the
one
we
burnt
was
nevertheless
considered
as
a
national
calamity
at
the
time
in
a
volume
of
miscellaneous
poems
i
met
with
one
written
with
the
patriotic
purpose
of
cheering
the
country
under
it
one
triplet
struck
me
as
rather
alarming
for
us
however
soothing
to
america
supposing
george
house
at
kew
were
burnt
as
we
intend
to
do
would
that
be
burning
england
too
i
think
i
have
before
mentioned
that
no
work
of
mere
pleasantry
has
hitherto
been
found
to
answer
but
a
recent
attempt
of
the
kind
as
been
made
with
what
success
can
not
as
yet
be
decided
the
editors
are
comedians
belonging
to
the
boston
company
and
it
is
entitled
the
american
comic
annual
it
is
accompanied
by
etchings
somewhat
in
the
manner
but
by
no
means
with
the
spirit
of
cruikshank
among
the
pleasantries
of
this
lively
volume
are
some
biting
attacks
upon
us
particularly
upon
our
utter
incapacity
of
speaking
english
we
really
must
engage
a
few
american
professors
or
we
shall
lose
all
trace
of
classic
purity
in
our
language
as
a
specimen
and
rather
a
favourable
one
of
the
work
i
transcribed
an
extract
from
a
little
piece
entitled
sayings
and
doings
a
fragment
of
a
farce
one
of
the
personages
of
this
farce
is
an
english
gentleman
a
captain
mandaville
and
among
many
speeches
of
the
same
kind
i
selected
the
following
collins
ode
is
the
subject
of
conversation
a
r

the
in
somethink
there
is
much
more
in
the
same
style
but
perhaps
this
may
suffice
i
have
given
this
passage
chiefly
because
it
affords
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
the
generality
of
americans
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
english
pronunciation
and
phraseology
it
must
be
remembered
however
here
and
every
where
that
this
phrase
the
americans
does
not
include
the
instructed
and
travelled
portion
of
the
community
it
would
be
absurd
to
swell
my
little
volumes
with
extracts
in
proof
of
the
veracity
of
their
contents
but
having
spoken
of
the
taste
of
their
lighter
works
and
also
of
the
general
tone
of
manners
i
can
not
forbear
inserting
a
page
from
an
american
annual
the
token
which
purports
to
give
a
scene
from
fashionable
life
it
is
part
of
a
dialogue
between
a
young
lady
of
the
highest
standing
and
her
tutor
who
is
moreover
her
lover
though
not
yet
acknowledged
and
so
you
tell
me
said
she
what
has
come
over
you
and
why
you
look
as
grave
and
sensible
as
a
dictionary
when
by
general
consent
even
mine
the
only
wear
am
i
so
grave
miss
blair
are
you
so
grave
miss
blair
one
would
think
i
had
not
got
my
lesson
today
pray
sir
has
the
black
ox
trod
upon
your
toe
since
we
parted
tried
to
laugh
but
he
did
not
succeed
he
bit
his
lip
and
was
silent
i
am
under
orders
to
entertain
you
blondel
and
if
my
poor
brain
can
be
made
to
gird
this
fairy
isle
i
shall
certainly
be
obedient
so
i
begin
with
playing
the
leech
what
ails
you
sir
miss
blair
he
was
going
to
remonstrate
miss
blair
now
pity
i
a
quack
for
whip
me
if
i
know
whether
miss
blair
is
a
fever
or
an
ague
how
did
you
catch
it
sir
really
miss
blair
nay
i
see
you
do
like
doctoring
i
give
over
and
now
be
sensible
it
a
fine
day
mr
blondel
very
a
pleasant
lane
this
to
walk
in
if
one
company
were
agreeable
does
skefton
stay
long
asked
philip
abruptly
no
one
knows
indeed
are
you
so
ignorant
and
why
does
your
wisdom
ask
that
question
in
no
society
in
the
world
can
the
advantage
of
travel
be
so
conspicuous
as
in
america
in
other
countries
a
tone
of
unpretending
simplicity
can
more
than
compensate
for
the
absence
of
enlarged
views
or
accurate
observation
but
this
tone
is
not
to
be
found
in
america
or
if
it
be
it
is
only
among
those
who
having
looked
at
that
insignificant
portion
of
the
world
not
included
in
the
union
have
learnt
to
know
how
much
is
still
unknown
within
the
mighty
part
which
is
for
the
rest
they
all
declare
and
do
in
truth
believe
that
they
only
among
the
sons
of
men
have
wit
and
wisdom
and
that
one
of
their
exclusive
privileges
is
that
of
speaking
english
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
latter
persuasion
the
one
is
that
the
great
majority
have
never
heard
any
english
but
their
own
except
from
the
very
lowest
of
the
irish
and
the
other
that
those
who
have
chanced
to
find
themselves
in
the
society
of
the
few
educated
english
who
have
visited
america
have
discovered
that
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
their
phrases
and
accents
and
those
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
whereupon
they
have
of
course
decided
that
no
englishman
can
speak
english
the
reviews
of
america
contain
some
good
articles
but
i
sought
in
vain
for
the
playful
vivacity
and
the
satire
whose
sharp
edge
however
painful
to
the
patient
is
of
such
high
utility
in
lopping
off
the
excrescences
of
bad
taste
and
levelling
to
its
native
clay
the
heavy
growth
of
dulness
still
less
could
i
find
any
trace
of
that
graceful
familiarity
of
learned
allusion
and
general
knowledge
which
mark
the
best
european
reviews
and
which
make
one
feel
in
such
perfectly
good
company
while
perusing
them
but
this
is
a
tone
not
to
be
found
either
in
the
writings
or
conversation
of
americans
as
distant
from
pedantry
as
from
ignorance
it
is
not
learning
itself
but
the
effect
of
it
and
so
pervading
and
subtle
is
its
influence
that
it
may
be
traced
in
the
festive
halls
and
gay
of
europe
as
certainly
as
in
the
cloistered
library
or
student
closet
it
is
perhaps
the
last
finish
of
society
a
late
american
quarterly
has
an
article
on
a
work
of
dr
von
schmidt
phiseldek
from
which
i
made
an
extract
as
a
curious
sample
of
the
dreams
they
love
to
batten
on
dr
von
phiseldek
not
fiddlestick
who
is
not
only
a
doctor
of
philosophy
but
a
knight
of
dannebrog
to
boot
has
never
been
in
america
but
he
has
written
a
prophecy
showing
that
the
united
states
must
and
will
govern
the
whole
world
because
they
are
so
very
big
and
have
so
much
uncultivated
territory
he
prophesies
that
an
union
will
take
place
between
north
and
south
america
which
will
give
a
to
europe
at
no
distant
period
though
he
modestly
adds
that
he
does
not
pretend
to
designate
the
precise
period
at
which
this
will
take
place
this
danish
prophecy
as
may
be
imagined
enchants
the
reviewer
he
exhorts
all
people
to
read
phiseldek
book
because
nothing
but
good
can
come
of
such
contemplations
of
the
future
and
because
it
is
eminently
calculated
to
awaken
the
most
lofty
anticipations
of
the
destiny
which
awaits
them
and
will
serve
to
impress
upon
the
nation
the
necessity
of
being
prepared
for
such
high
destiny
in
another
place
the
reviewer
bursts
out
america
young
as
she
is
has
become
already
the
beacon
the
patriarch
of
the
struggling
nations
of
the
world
and
afterwards
adds
it
would
be
departing
from
the
natural
order
of
things
and
the
ordinary
operations
of
the
great
scheme
of
providence
it
would
be
shutting
our
ears
to
the
voice
of
experience
and
our
eyes
to
the
inevitable
connexion
of
causes
and
their
effects
were
we
to
reject
the
extreme
probability
not
to
say
that
the
old
world
is
destined
to
receive
its
influences
in
future
from
the
new
there
are
twenty
pages
of
this
article
but
i
will
only
give
one
passage
more
it
is
an
instance
of
the
sort
of
reasoning
by
which
american
citizens
persuade
themselves
that
the
glory
of
europe
is
in
reality
her
reproach
wrapped
up
in
a
sense
of
his
superiority
the
european
reclines
at
home
shining
in
his
borrowed
plumes
derived
from
the
product
of
every
corner
of
the
earth
and
the
industry
of
every
portion
of
its
inhabitants
with
which
his
own
natural
resources
would
never
have
invested
him
he
continues
revelling
in
enjoyments
which
nature
has
denied
him
the
american
quarterly
deservedly
holds
the
highest
place
in
their
periodical
literature
and
therefore
may
be
fairly
quoted
as
striking
the
keynote
for
the
chorus
of
public
opinion
surely
it
is
nationality
rather
than
patriotism
which
leads
it
thus
to
speak
in
scorn
of
the
successful
efforts
of
enlightened
nations
to
win
from
every
corner
of
the
earth
the
riches
which
nature
has
scattered
over
it
the
incorrectness
of
the
press
is
very
great
they
make
strange
work
in
the
reprints
of
french
and
italian
and
the
latin
i
suspect
does
not
fare
much
better
i
believe
they
do
not
often
meddle
with
greek
with
regard
to
the
fine
arts
their
paintings
i
think
are
quite
as
good
or
rather
better
than
might
be
expected
from
the
patronage
they
receive
the
wonder
is
that
any
man
can
be
found
with
courage
enough
to
devote
himself
to
a
profession
in
which
he
has
so
little
chance
of
finding
a
maintenance
the
trade
of
a
carpenter
opens
an
infinitely
better
prospect
and
this
is
so
well
known
that
nothing
but
a
genuine
passion
for
the
art
could
beguile
any
one
to
pursue
it
the
entire
absence
of
every
means
of
improvement
and
effectual
study
is
unquestionably
the
cause
why
those
who
manifest
this
devotion
can
not
advance
farther
i
heard
of
one
young
artist
whose
circumstances
did
not
permit
his
going
to
europe
but
who
being
nevertheless
determined
that
his
studies
should
as
nearly
as
possible
resemble
those
of
the
european
academies
was
about
to
commence
drawing
the
human
figure
for
which
purpose
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
thin
silk
dress
in
which
to
clothe
his
models
as
no
one
of
any
station
he
said
could
be
found
who
would
submit
to
sit
as
a
model
without
clothing
it
was
at
alexandria
that
i
saw
what
i
consider
as
the
best
picture
by
an
american
artist
that
i
met
with
the
subject
was
hagar
and
ishmael
it
had
recently
arrived
from
rome
where
the
painter
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
chapman
had
been
studying
for
three
years
his
mother
told
me
that
he
was
years
of
age
and
passionately
devoted
to
the
art
should
he
on
returning
to
his
country
receive
sufficient
encouragement
to
keep
his
ardour
and
his
industry
alive
i
think
i
shall
hear
of
him
again
much
is
said
about
the
universal
diffusion
of
education
in
america
and
a
vast
deal
of
genuine
admiration
is
felt
and
expressed
at
the
progress
of
mind
throughout
the
union
they
believe
themselves
in
all
sincerity
to
have
surpassed
to
be
surpassing
and
to
be
about
to
surpass
the
whole
earth
in
the
intellectual
race
i
am
aware
that
not
a
single
word
can
be
said
hinting
a
different
opinion
which
will
not
bring
down
a
transatlantic
anathema
on
my
head
yet
the
subject
is
too
interesting
to
be
omitted
before
i
left
england
i
remember
listening
with
much
admiration
to
an
eloquent
friend
who
deprecated
our
system
of
public
education
as
confining
the
various
and
excursive
faculties
of
our
children
to
one
beaten
path
paying
little
or
no
attention
to
the
peculiar
powers
of
the
individual
this
objection
is
extremely
plausible
but
doubts
of
its
intrinsic
value
must
i
think
occur
to
every
one
who
has
marked
the
result
of
a
different
system
throughout
the
united
states
from
every
enquiry
i
could
make
and
i
took
much
pains
to
obtain
accurate
information
it
appeared
that
much
is
attempted
but
very
little
beyond
reading
writing
and
bookkeeping
is
thoroughly
acquired
were
we
to
read
a
prospectus
of
the
system
pursued
in
any
of
our
public
schools
and
that
of
a
seminary
in
america
we
should
be
struck
by
the
confined
scholastic
routine
of
the
former
when
compared
to
the
varied
and
expansive
scope
of
the
latter
but
let
the
examination
go
a
little
farther
and
i
believe
it
will
be
found
that
the
old
fashioned
school
discipline
of
england
has
produced
something
higher
and
deeper
too
than
that
which
roars
so
loud
and
thunders
in
the
index
they
will
not
afford
to
let
their
young
men
study
till
two
or
three
and
twenty
and
it
is
therefore
declared
cathedra
to
be
unnecessary
at
sixteen
often
much
earlier
education
ends
and
begins
the
idea
that
more
learning
is
necessary
than
can
be
acquired
by
that
time
is
generally
ridiculed
as
obsolete
monkish
bigotry
added
to
which
if
the
seniors
willed
a
more
prolonged
discipline
the
juniors
would
refuse
submission
when
the
begins
leisure
ceases
and
all
of
lore
which
can
be
acquired
afterwards
is
picked
up
from
novels
magazines
and
newspapers
at
what
time
can
the
taste
be
formed
how
can
a
correct
and
polished
style
even
of
speaking
be
acquired
or
when
can
the
fruit
of
the
two
thousand
years
of
past
thinking
be
added
to
the
native
growth
of
american
intellect
these
are
the
tools
if
i
may
so
express
myself
which
our
elaborate
system
of
school
discipline
puts
into
the
hands
of
our
scholars
possessed
of
these
they
may
use
them
in
whatever
direction
they
please
afterwards
they
can
never
be
an
incumbrance
no
people
appear
more
anxious
to
excite
admiration
and
receive
applause
than
the
americans
yet
none
take
so
little
trouble
or
make
so
few
sacrifices
to
obtain
it
this
may
answer
among
themselves
but
it
will
not
with
the
rest
of
the
world
individual
sacrifices
must
be
made
and
national
economy
enlarged
before
america
can
compete
with
the
old
world
in
taste
learning
and
liberality
the
reception
of
general
lafayette
is
the
one
single
instance
in
which
the
national
pride
has
overcome
the
national
thrift
and
this
was
clearly
referrible
to
the
one
single
feeling
of
enthusiasm
of
which
they
appear
capable
namely
the
triumph
of
their
successful
struggle
for
national
independence
but
though
this
feeling
will
be
universally
acknowledged
as
a
worthy
and
lawful
source
of
triumph
and
of
pride
it
will
not
serve
to
trade
upon
for
ever
as
a
fund
of
glory
and
high
station
among
the
nations
their
fathers
were
colonists
they
fought
stoutly
and
became
an
independent
people
success
and
admiration
even
the
admiration
of
those
whose
yoke
they
had
broken
cheered
them
while
living
still
sheds
a
glory
round
their
remote
and
untitled
sepulchres
and
will
illumine
the
page
of
their
history
for
ever
their
children
inherit
the
independence
they
inherit
too
the
honour
of
being
the
sons
of
brave
fathers
but
this
will
not
give
them
the
reputation
at
which
they
aim
of
being
scholars
and
gentlemen
nor
will
it
enable
them
to
sit
down
for
evermore
to
talk
of
their
glory
while
they
drink
mint
julap
and
chew
tobacco
swearing
by
the
beard
of
jupiter
or
some
other
oath
that
they
are
very
graceful
and
agreeable
and
moreover
abusing
every
body
who
does
not
cry
out
amen
to
doubt
that
talent
and
mental
power
of
every
kind
exist
in
america
would
be
absurd
why
should
it
not
but
in
taste
and
learning
they
are
woefully
deficient
and
it
is
this
which
renders
them
incapable
of
graduating
a
scale
by
which
to
measure
themselves
hence
arises
that
over
weening
complacency
and
both
national
and
individual
which
at
once
renders
them
so
extremely
obnoxious
to
ridicule
and
so
peculiarly
restive
under
it
if
they
will
scorn
the
process
by
which
other
nations
have
become
what
they
avowedly
intend
to
be
they
must
rest
satisfied
with
the
praise
and
admiration
they
receive
from
each
other
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
criticism
of
the
old
world
consent
to
be
their
own
prodigious
great
reward
alexandria
has
its
churches
chapels
and
conventicles
as
abundantly
in
proportion
to
its
size
as
any
city
in
the
union
i
visited
most
of
them
and
in
the
episcopal
and
catholic
heard
the
services
performed
quietly
and
reverently
the
best
sermon
however
that
i
listened
to
was
in
a
methodist
church
from
the
mouth
of
a
piquot
indian
it
was
impossible
not
be
touched
by
the
simple
sincerity
of
this
poor
man
he
gave
a
picture
frightfully
eloquent
of
the
decay
of
his
people
under
the
united
influence
of
the
avarice
and
intemperance
of
the
white
men
he
described
the
effect
of
the
religious
feeling
which
had
recently
found
its
way
among
them
as
most
salutary
the
purity
of
his
moral
feeling
and
the
sincerity
of
his
sympathy
with
his
forest
brethren
made
it
unquestionable
that
he
must
be
the
most
valuable
priest
who
could
officiate
for
them
his
english
was
very
correct
and
his
pronunciation
but
slightly
tinctured
by
native
accent
while
we
were
still
in
the
neighbourhood
of
washington
a
most
violent
and
unprecedented
schism
occurred
in
the
cabinet
the
four
secretaries
of
state
all
resigned
leaving
general
jackson
to
manage
the
queer
little
state
barge
alone
innumerable
contradictory
statements
appeared
upon
this
occasion
in
the
papers
and
many
a
cigar
was
thrown
aside
ere
half
consumed
that
the
disinterested
politician
might
give
breath
to
his
cogitations
on
this
extraordinary
event
but
not
all
the
eloquence
of
all
the
smokers
nor
even
the
ultradiplomatic
expositions
which
appeared
from
the
seceding
secretaries
themselves
could
throw
any
light
on
the
mysterious
business
it
produced
however
the
only
tolerable
caricature
i
ever
saw
in
the
country
it
represents
the
president
seated
alone
in
his
cabinet
wearing
a
look
of
much
discomfiture
and
making
great
exertions
to
detain
one
of
four
rats
who
are
running
off
by
placing
his
foot
on
the
tail
the
rats
heads
bear
a
very
sufficient
resemblance
to
the
four
general
jackson
it
seems
had
requested
van
buren
the
secretary
of
state
to
remain
in
office
till
his
place
was
supplied
this
gave
occasion
to
a
from
his
son
who
being
asked
when
his
father
would
be
in
new
york
replied
when
the
president
takes
off
his
foot
chapter
journey
to
new

collegiate

morris
canal
fashions
carriages
at
length
in
spite
of
the
lingering
pace
necessarily
attending
consultations
and
arrangements
across
the
atlantic
our
plans
were
finally
settled
the
coming
spring
was
to
show
us
new
york
and
niagara
and
the
early
summer
was
to
convey
us
home
no
sooner
did
the
letter
arrive
which
decided
this
than
we
began
our
preparations
for
departure
we
took
our
last
voyage
on
the
potomac
we
bade
a
last
farewell
to
virginia
and
gave
a
last
day
to
some
of
our
kind
friends
near
washington
the
spring
though
slow
and
backward
was
sufficiently
advanced
to
render
the
journey
pleasant
and
though
the
road
from
washington
to
baltimore
was
less
brilliant
in
foliage
than
when
i
had
seen
it
before
it
still
had
much
of
beauty
the
azalias
were
in
full
bloom
and
the
delicate
yellow
blossom
of
the
sassafras
almost
rivalled
its
fruit
in
beauty
at
baltimore
we
again
embarked
on
a
gigantic
and
reached
philadelphia
in
the
middle
of
the
night
here
we
changed
our
boat
and
found
time
before
starting
in
the
morning
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
doric
and
corinthian
porticos
of
the
two
celebrated
temples
dedicated
to
mammon
the
delaware
river
above
philadelphia
still
flows
through
a
landscape
too
level
for
beauty
but
it
is
rendered
interesting
by
a
succession
of
gentlemen
seats
which
if
less
elaborately
finished
in
architecture
and
garden
grounds
than
the
lovely
villas
on
the
thames
are
still
beautiful
objects
to
gaze
upon
as
you
float
rapidly
past
on
the
broad
silvery
stream
that
washes
their
lawns
they
present
a
picture
of
wealth
and
enjoyment
that
accords
well
with
the
noble
city
to
which
they
are
an
appendage
one
mansion
arrested
our
attention
not
only
from
its
being
more
than
usually
large
and
splendid
but
from
its
having
the
monument
which
marked
the
family
rearing
itself
in
all
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
black
and
white
marble
exactly
opposite
the
door
of
entrance
in
virginia
and
maryland
we
had
remarked
that
almost
every
family
mansion
had
its
little
grave
yard
sheltered
by
locust
and
cypress
trees
but
this
decorated
dwelling
of
the
dead
seemed
rather
a
melancholy
ornament
in
the
grounds
we
had
for
a
considerable
distance
a
view
of
the
dwelling
of
joseph
bonaparte
which
is
situated
on
the
new
jersey
shore
in
the
midst
of
an
extensive
tract
of
land
of
which
he
is
the
proprietor
here
the
has
built
several
houses
which
are
occupied
by
french
tenants
the
country
is
very
flat
but
a
terrace
of
two
sides
has
been
raised
commanding
a
fine
reach
of
the
delaware
river
at
the
point
where
this
terrace
forms
a
right
angle
a
lofty
chapel
has
been
erected
which
looks
very
much
like
an
observatory
i
admired
the
ingenuity
with
which
the
catholic
prince
has
united
his
religion
and
his
love
of
a
fine
terrestrial
prospect
the
highest
part
of
the
building
presents
in
every
direction
the
appearance
of
an
immense
cross
the
transept
if
i
may
so
express
it
being
formed
by
the
projection
of
an
ample
balcony
which
surrounds
a
tower
a
quaker
gentleman
from
philadelphia
exclaimed
as
he
gazed
on
the
mansion
there
we
see
a
monument
of
fallen
royalty
strange
that
dethroned
kings
should
seek
and
find
their
best
in
a
republic
there
was
more
of
philosophy
than
of
scorn
in
his
accent
and
his
countenance
was
the
symbol
of
gentleness
and
benevolence
but
i
overheard
many
unquakerlike
jokes
from
others
as
to
the
comfortable
assurance
a
king
must
feel
of
a
faithful
alliance
between
his
head
and
shoulders
at
trenton
the
capital
of
new
jersey
we
left
our
comfortable
boat
for
the
most
detestable
that
ever
christian
built
to
dislocate
the
joints
of
his
fellow
men
ten
of
these
torturing
machines
were
crammed
full
of
the
passengers
who
left
the
boat
with
us
the
change
in
our
movement
was
not
more
remarkable
than
that
which
took
place
in
the
tempers
and
countenances
of
our
gentlemen
who
had
lounged
on
sofas
and
balanced
themselves
in
chairs
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
with
all
the
conscious
fascinations
of
stiff
stays
and
which
while
doing
to
death
the
rash
beauties
who
ventured
to
gaze
seemed
but
a
whalebone
panoply
to
guard
the
wearer
these
pretty
youths
so
guarded
from
without
so
sweetly
at
peace
within
now
crushed
beneath
their
armour
looked
more
like
victims
on
the
wheel
than
dandies
armed
for
conquest
their
whalebones
seemed
to
enter
into
their
souls
and
every
face
grew
grim
and
scowling
the
pretty
ladies
too
with
their
expansive
bonnets
any
one
of
which
might
handsomely
have
filled
the
space
allotted
to
three
how
sad
the
change
i
almost
fancied
they
must
have
been
of
the
race
of
undine
and
that
it
was
only
when
they
heard
the
splashing
of
water
that
they
could
smile
as
i
looked
into
the
altered
eyes
of
my
companions
i
was
tempted
to
ask
look
i
as
cross
as
you
indeed
i
believe
that
if
possible
i
looked
crosser
still
for
the
roads
and
the
vehicle
together
were
quite
too
much
for
my
philosophy
at
length
however
we
found
ourselves
alive
on
board
the
boat
which
was
to
convey
us
down
the
raraton
river
to
new
york
we
fully
intended
to
have
gone
to
bed
to
heal
our
bones
on
entering
the
but
the
sight
of
a
table
neatly
spread
determined
us
to
go
to
dinner
instead
sin
and
shame
would
it
have
been
indeed
to
have
closed
our
eyes
upon
the
scene
which
soon
opened
before
us
i
have
never
seen
the
bay
of
naples
i
can
therefore
make
no
comparison
but
my
imagination
is
incapable
of
conceiving
any
thing
of
the
kind
more
beautiful
than
the
harbour
of
new
york
various
and
lovely
are
the
objects
which
meet
the
eye
on
every
side
but
the
naming
them
would
only
be
to
give
a
list
of
words
without
conveying
the
faintest
idea
of
the
scene
i
doubt
if
ever
the
pencil
of
turner
could
do
it
justice
bright
and
glorious
as
it
rose
upon
us
we
seemed
to
enter
the
harbour
of
new
york
upon
waves
of
liquid
gold
and
as
we
darted
past
the
green
isles
which
rise
from
its
bosom
like
guardian
centinels
of
the
fair
city
the
setting
sun
stretched
his
horizontal
beams
farther
and
farther
at
each
moment
as
if
to
point
out
to
us
some
new
glory
in
the
landscape
new
york
indeed
appeared
to
us
even
when
we
saw
it
by
a
soberer
light
a
lovely
and
a
noble
city
to
us
who
had
been
so
long
travelling
through
forests
and
sojourning
among
an
population
it
seemed
perhaps
more
beautiful
more
splendid
and
more
refined
than
it
might
have
done
had
we
arrived
there
directly
from
london
but
making
every
allowance
for
this
i
must
still
declare
that
i
think
new
york
one
of
the
finest
cities
i
ever
saw
and
as
much
superior
to
every
other
in
the
union
philadelphia
not
excepted
as
london
to
liverpool
or
paris
to
rouen
its
advantages
of
position
are
perhaps
unequalled
any
where
situated
on
an
island
which
i
think
it
will
one
day
cover
it
rises
like
venice
from
the
sea
and
like
that
fairest
of
cities
in
the
days
of
her
glory
receives
into
its
lap
tribute
of
all
the
riches
of
the
earth
the
southern
point
of
manhatten
island
divides
the
waters
of
the
harbour
into
the
north
and
east
rivers
on
this
point
stands
the
city
of
new
york
extending
from
river
to
river
and
running
northward
to
the
extent
of
three
or
four
miles
i
think
it
covers
nearly
as
much
ground
as
paris
but
is
much
less
thickly
peopled
the
extreme
point
is
fortified
towards
the
sea
by
a
battery
and
forms
an
admirable
point
of
defence
i
should
suppose
no
city
could
boast
from
hence
commences
the
splendid
broadway
as
the
fine
avenue
is
called
which
runs
through
the
whole
city
this
noble
street
may
vie
with
any
i
ever
saw
for
its
length
and
breadth
its
handsome
shops
neat
awnings
excellent
and
pedestrians
it
has
not
the
crowded
glitter
of
bond
street
equipages
nor
the
gorgeous
fronted
palaces
of
regent
street
but
it
is
magnificent
in
its
extent
and
ornamented
by
several
handsome
buildings
some
of
them
surrounded
by
grass
and
trees
the
park
in
which
stands
the
noble
is
a
very
fine
area
i
never
found
that
the
most
graphic
description
of
a
city
could
give
me
any
feeling
of
being
there
and
even
if
others
have
the
power
i
am
very
sure
i
have
not
of
setting
churches
and
squares
and
long
drawn
streets
before
the
mind
eye
i
will
not
therefore
attempt
a
detailed
description
of
this
great
metropolis
of
the
new
world
but
will
only
say
that
during
the
seven
weeks
we
stayed
there
we
always
found
something
new
to
see
and
to
admire
and
were
it
not
so
very
far
from
all
the
things
which
cling
about
the
heart
of
an
european
i
should
say
that
i
never
saw
a
city
more
desirable
as
a
residence
the
dwelling
houses
of
the
higher
classes
are
extremely
handsome
and
very
richly
furnished
silk
or
satin
furniture
is
as
often
or
oftener
seen
than
chintz
the
mirrors
are
as
handsome
as
in
london
the
cheffoniers
slabs
and
marble
tables
as
elegant
and
in
addition
they
have
all
the
pretty
tasteful
decoration
of
french
porcelaine
and
in
much
greater
abundance
because
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
every
part
of
their
houses
is
well
carpeted
and
the
exterior
finishing
such
as
steps
railings
and
are
very
superior
almost
every
house
has
handsome
green
blinds
on
the
outside
balconies
are
not
very
general
nor
do
the
houses
display
externally
so
many
flowers
as
those
of
paris
and
london
but
i
saw
many
rooms
decorated
within
exactly
like
those
of
an
european
little
tables
looking
and
smelling
like
flower
beds
portfolios
bronzes
busts
cameos
and
alabaster
vases
illustrated
copies
of
ladylike
rhymes
bound
in
silk
and
in
short
all
the
pretty
coxcomalities
of
the
scattered
about
with
the
same
profuse
and
studied
negligence
as
with
us
hudson
square
and
its
neighbourhood
is
i
believe
the
most
fashionable
part
of
the
town
the
square
is
beautiful
excellently
well
planted
with
a
great
variety
of
trees
and
only
wanting
our
frequent
and
careful
mowing
to
make
it
equal
to
any
square
in
london
the
iron
railing
which
surrounds
this
enclosure
is
as
high
and
as
handsome
as
that
of
the
tuilleries
and
it
will
give
some
idea
of
the
care
bestowed
on
its
decoration
to
know
that
the
gravel
for
the
walks
was
conveyed
by
barges
from
boston
not
as
ballast
but
as
freight
the
great
defect
in
the
houses
is
their
extreme
uniformity
when
you
have
seen
one
you
have
seen
all
neither
do
i
quite
like
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
in
nearly
all
the
houses
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms
are
on
the
same
floor
with
ample
folding
doors
between
them
when
thrown
together
they
certainly
make
a
very
noble
apartment
but
no
doors
can
be
barrier
sufficient
between
dining
and
mixed
dinner
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
however
are
very
rare
which
is
a
great
defect
in
the
society
not
only
as
depriving
them
of
the
most
social
and
hospitable
manner
of
meeting
but
as
leading
to
frequent
dinner
parties
of
gentlemen
without
ladies
which
certainly
does
not
conduce
to
refinement
the
evening
parties
excepting
such
as
are
expressly
for
young
people
are
chiefly
conversational
we
were
too
late
in
the
season
for
large
parties
but
we
saw
enough
to
convince
us
that
there
is
society
to
be
met
with
in
new
york
which
would
be
deemed
delightful
any
where
cards
are
very
seldom
used
and
music
from
their
having
very
little
professional
aid
at
their
parties
is
seldom
i
believe
as
good
as
what
is
heard
at
private
concerts
in
london
the
americans
have
certainly
not
the
same
of
being
amused
as
other
people
they
may
be
the
wiser
for
this
perhaps
but
it
makes
them
less
agreeable
to
a
there
are
three
theatres
at
new
york
all
of
which
we
visited
the
park
theatre
is
the
only
one
licensed
by
fashion
but
the
bowery
is
infinitely
superior
in
beauty
it
is
indeed
as
pretty
a
theatre
as
i
ever
entered
perfect
as
to
size
and
proportion
elegantly
decorated
and
the
scenery
and
machinery
equal
to
any
in
london
but
it
is
not
the
fashion
the
chatham
is
so
utterly
condemned
by
that
it
requires
some
courage
to
decide
upon
going
there
nor
do
i
think
my
curiosity
would
have
penetrated
so
far
had
i
not
seen
miss
mitford
rienzi
advertised
there
it
was
the
first
opportunity
i
had
had
of
seeing
it
played
and
spite
of
very
indifferent
acting
i
was
delighted
the
interest
must
have
been
great
for
till
the
curtain
fell
i
saw
not
one
quarter
of
the
queer
things
around
me
then
i
observed
in
the
front
row
of
a
a
lady
performing
the
most
maternal
office
possible
several
gentlemen
without
their
coats
and
a
general
air
of
contempt
for
the
decencies
of
life
certainly
more
than
usually
revolting
at
the
park
theatre
i
again
saw
the
american
roscius
forrest
he
played
the
part
of
damon
and
roared
i
thought
very
unlike
a
nightingale
i
can
not
admire
this
celebrated
performer
another
night
we
saw
cinderella
there
austin
was
the
prima
donna
and
much
admired
the
piece
was
extremely
well
got
up
and
on
this
occasion
we
saw
the
park
theatre
to
advantage
for
it
was
filled
with
company
but
still
we
saw
many
yet
unrazored
lips
polluted
with
the
grim
tinge
of
the
hateful
tobacco
and
heard
without
ceasing
the
spitting
which
of
course
is
its
consequence
if
their
theatres
had
the
orchestra
of
the
feydeau
and
a
choir
of
angels
to
boot
i
could
find
but
little
pleasure
so
long
as
they
were
followed
by
this
running
accompaniment
of
whilst
at
new
york
the
prospectus
of

presented
to

and
the

which
decorates
the
bourse
at

the
churches
are
plain
but
very
neat
and
kept
in
perfect
repair
within
and
without
but
i
saw
none
which
had
the
least
pretension
to
splendour
the
catholic
cathedral
at
baltimore
is
the
only
church
in
america
which
has
at
new
york
as
every
where
else
they
show
within
during
the
time
of
service
like
beds
of
tulips
so
gay
so
bright
so
beautiful
are
the
long
rows
of
french
bonnets
and
pretty
faces
rows
but
rarely
broken
by
the
unribboned
heads
of
the
male
population
the
proportion
is
about
the
same
as
i
have
remarked
elsewhere
excepting
at
new
york
i
never
saw
the
other
side
of
the
picture
but
there
i
did
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
north
river
about
three
miles
higher
up
is
a
place
called
hoboken
a
gentleman
who
possessed
a
handsome
mansion
and
grounds
there
also
possessed
the
right
of
ferry
and
to
render
this
productive
he
has
restricted
his
pleasure
grounds
to
a
few
beautiful
acres
laying
out
the
remainder
simply
and
tastefully
as
a
public
walk
it
is
hardly
possible
to
imagine
one
of
greater
attraction
a
broad
belt
of
light
underwood
and
flowering
shrubs
studded
at
intervals
with
lofty
forest
trees
runs
for
two
miles
along
a
cliff
which
overhangs
the
matchless
hudson
sometimes
it
feathers
the
rocks
down
to
its
very
margin
and
at
others
leaves
a
pebbly
shore
just
rude
enough
to
break
the
gentle
waves
and
make
a
music
which
mimics
softly
the
loud
chorus
of
the
ocean
through
this
beautiful
little
wood
a
broad
well
gravelled
terrace
is
led
by
every
point
which
can
exhibit
the
scenery
to
advantage
narrower
and
wilder
paths
diverge
at
intervals
some
into
the
deeper
shadow
of
the
wood
and
some
shelving
gradually
to
the
pretty
coves
below
the
price
of
entrance
to
this
little
eden
is
the
six
cents
you
pay
at
the
ferry
we
went
there
on
a
bright
sunday
afternoon
expressly
to
see
the
humours
of
the
place
many
thousand
persons
were
scattered
through
the
grounds
of
these
we
ascertained
by
repeatedly
counting
that
were
men
the
ladies
were
at
church
often
as
the
subject
has
pressed
upon
my
mind
i
think
i
never
so
strongly
felt
the
conviction
that
the
the
holy
day
the
day
on
which
alone
the
great
majority
of
the
christian
world
can
spend
their
hours
as
they
please
is
ill
passed
if
passed
entirely
within
brick
walls
listening
to
an
preacher
charm
he
never
so
wisely
oh
how
can
they
renounce
the
boundless
store
of
charms
which
nature
to
her
yields
the
warbling
woodland
the
resounding
shore
the
pomp
of
groves
and
garniture
of
fields
all
that
the
genial
ray
of
morning
gilds
and
all
that
echoes
to
the
song
of
even
all
that
the
mountain
sheltering
bosom
yields
and
all
the
dread
magnificence
of
heaven
oh
how
can
they
renounce
and
hope
to
be
forgiven
how
is
it
that
the
men
of
america
who
are
reckoned
good
husbands
and
good
fathers
while
they
themselves
enjoy
sufficient
freedom
of
spirit
to
permit
their
walking
forth
into
the
temple
of
the
living
god
can
leave
those
they
love
best
on
earth
bound
in
the
iron
chains
of
a
most
tyrannical
fanaticism
how
can
they
breathe
the
balmy
air
and
not
think
of
the
tainted
atmosphere
so
heavily
weighing
upon
breasts
still
dearer
than
their
own
how
can
they
gaze
upon
the
blossoms
of
the
spring
and
not
remember
the
fairer
cheeks
of
their
young
daughters
waxing
pale
as
they
sit
for
long
sultry
hours
immured
with
hundreds
of
fellow
victims
listening
to
the
roaring
vanities
of
a
preacher
canonized
by
a
college
of
old
women
they
can
not
think
it
needful
to
salvation
or
they
would
not
withdraw
themselves
wherefore
is
it
do
they
fear
these
priests
and
offer
up
their
wives
and
daughters
to
propitiate
them
or
do
they
deem
their
hebdomadal
freedom
more
complete
because
their
wives
and
daughters
are
shut
up
four
or
five
times
in
the
day
at
church
or
chapel
it
is
true
that
at
hoboken
as
every
where
else
there
are
which
as
you
pass
them
blast
the
sense
for
a
moment
by
reeking
forth
the
fumes
of
whiskey
and
tobacco
and
it
may
be
that
these
can
not
be
entered
with
a
wife
or
daughter
the
proprietor
of
the
grounds
however
has
contrived
with
great
taste
to
render
these
abominations
not
unpleasing
to
the
eye
there
is
one
in
particular
which
has
quite
the
air
of
a
grecian
temple
and
did
they
drink
wine
instead
of
whiskey
it
might
be
inscribed
to
bacchus
but
in
this
particular
as
in
many
others
the
ancient
and
modern
republics
differ
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
after
passing
one
sunday
in
the
churches
and
chapels
of
new
york
and
the
next
in
the
gardens
of
hoboken
that
the
thousands
of
men
you
see
enjoying
themselves
at
the
latter
have
made
over
the
thousands
of
women
you
saw
exhibited
at
the
former
into
the
hands
of
the
priests
at
least
for
the
day
the
american
people
arrogate
to
themselves
a
character
of
superior
morality
and
religion
but
this
division
of
their
hours
of
leisure
does
not
give
me
a
favourable
idea
of
either
i
visited
all
the
exhibitions
in
new
york
the
medici
of
the
republic
must
exert
themselves
a
little
more
before
these
can
become
even
respectable
the
worst
of
the
business
is
that
with
the
exception
of
about
half
a
dozen
individuals
the
good
citizens
are
more
than
contented
they
are
delighted
the
newspaper
lungs
of
the
republic
breathe
forth
praise
and
triumph
may
almost
pant
with
extacy
in
speaking
of
their
native
i
should
be
hardly
believed
were
i
to
relate
the
instances
which
fell
in
my
way
of
the
utter
ignorance
respecting
pictures
to
be
found
among
persons
of
the
in
society
often
where
a
liberal
spirit
exists
and
a
wish
to
patronise
the
fine
arts
is
expressed
it
is
joined
to
a
profundity
of
ignorance
on
the
subject
almost
inconceivable
a
doubt
as
to
the
excellence
of
their
artists
is
very
nervously
received
and
one
gentleman
with
much
civility
told
me
that
at
the
present
era
all
the
world
were
aware
that
competition
was
pretty
well
at
an
end
between
our
two
nations
and
that
a
little
envy
might
naturally
be
expected
to
mix
with
the
surprise
with
which
the
mother
country
beheld
the
distance
at
which
her
colonies
were
leaving
her
behind
them
i
must
however
do
the
few
artists
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
the
justice
to
say
that
their
own
pretensions
are
much
more
modest
than
those
of
their
patrons
for
them
i
have
heard
several
confess
and
deplore
their
ignorance
of
drawing
and
have
repeatedly
remarked
a
sensibility
to
the
merit
of
european
artists
though
perhaps
only
known
by
engravings
and
a
deference
to
their
authority
which
showed
a
genuine
feeling
for
the
art
in
fact
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
considerable
degree
of
natural
talent
for
painting
in
america
but
it
has
to
make
its
way
through
darkness
and
thick
night
when
an
academy
is
founded
their
first
care
is
to
hang
the
walls
of
its
exhibition
room
with
all
the
unutterable
trash
that
is
offered
to
them
no
living
models
are
sought
for
no
discipline
as
to
the
manner
of
study
is
enforced
boys
who
know
no
more
of
human
form
than
they
do
of
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
in
the
moon
begin
painting
portraits
if
some
of
them
would
only
throw
away
their
palettes
for
a
year
and
learn
to
draw
if
they
would
attend
anatomical
lectures
and
take
notes
not
in
words
but
in
forms
of
joints
and
muscles
their
exhibitions
would
soon
cease
to
be
so
utterly
below
criticism
the
most
interesting
exhibition
open
when
i
was
there
was
decidedly
colonel
trumbold
and
how
the
patriots
of
america
can
permit
this
truly
national
collection
to
remain
a
profitless
burden
on
the
hands
of
the
artist
it
is
difficult
to
understand
many
of
the
sketches
are
masterly
but
like
his
illustrious
countryman
west
his
sketches
are
his
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
perfect
than
the
interior
of
the
public
institutions
of
new
york
there
is
a
practical
good
sense
in
all
their
arrangements
that
must
strike
foreigners
very
forcibly
the
asylum
for
the
destitute
offers
a
hint
worth
taking
it
is
dedicated
to
the
reformation
of
youthful
offenders
of
both
sexes
and
it
is
as
admirable
in
the
details
of
its
management
as
in
its
object
every
part
of
the
institution
is
deeply
interesting
but
there
is
a
difference
very
remarkable
between
the
boys
and
the
girls
the
boys
are
i
think
the
finest
set
of
lads
i
ever
saw
brought
together
bright
looking
gay
active
and
full
of
intelligence
the
girls
are
exactly
in
reverse
heavy
listless
indifferent
and
melancholy
in
conversing
with
the
gentleman
who
is
the
general
superintendant
of
the
establishment
i
made
the
remark
to
him
and
he
told
me
that
the
reality
corresponded
with
the
appearance
all
of
them
had
been
detected
in
some
act
of
dishonesty
but
the
boys
when
removed
from
the
evil
influence
which
had
led
them
so
to
use
their
ingenuity
rose
like
a
spring
when
a
pressure
is
withdrawn
and
feeling
themselves
once
more
safe
from
danger
and
from
shame
hope
and
cheerfulness
animated
every
countenance
but
the
pour
girls
on
the
contrary
can
hardly
look
up
again
they
are
as
different
as
an
oak
and
a
lily
after
a
storm
the
one
when
the
fresh
breeze
blows
over
it
shakes
the
raindrops
from
its
crest
and
only
looks
the
brighter
the
other
its
silken
leaves
once
soiled
shrinks
from
the
eye
and
is
levelled
to
the
earth
for
ever
we
spent
a
delightful
day
in
new
jersey
in
visiting
with
a
most
agreeable
party
the
inclined
planes
which
are
used
instead
of
locks
on
the
morris
canal
this
is
a
very
interesting
work
it
is
one
among
a
thousand
which
prove
the
people
of
america
to
be
the
most
enterprising
in
the
world
i
was
informed
that
this
important
canal
which
connects
the
waters
of
the
hudson
and
the
delaware
is
a
hundred
miles
long
and
in
this
distance
overcomes
a
variation
of
level
amounting
to
sixteen
hundred
feet
of
this
fourteen
hundred
are
achieved
by
inclined
planes
the
planes
average
about
sixty
feet
of
perpendicular
lift
each
and
are
to
support
about
forty
tons
the
time
consumed
in
passing
them
is
twelve
minutes
for
one
hundred
feet
of
perpendicular
rise
the
expense
is
less
than
a
third
of
what
locks
would
be
for
surmounting
the
same
rise
if
we
set
about
any
more
canals
this
may
be
worth
attending
to
this
morris
canal
is
certainly
an
extraordinary
work
it
not
only
varies
its
level
sixteen
hundred
feet
but
at
one
point
runs
along
the
side
of
a
mountain
at
thirty
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
highest
buildings
in
the
town
of
paterson
below
at
another
it
crosses
the
falls
of
the
passaic
in
a
stone
aqueduct
sixty
feet
above
the
water
in
the
river
this
noble
work
in
a
great
degree
owes
its
existence
to
the
patriotic
and
scientific
energy
of
cadwallader
colden
there
is
no
point
in
the
national
character
of
the
americans
which
commands
so
much
respect
as
the
boldness
and
energy
with
which
public
works
are
undertaken
and
carried
through
nothing
stops
them
if
a
profitable
result
can
be
fairly
hoped
for
it
is
this
which
has
made
cities
spring
up
amidst
the
forests
with
such
inconceivable
rapidity
and
could
they
once
be
thoroughly
persuaded
that
any
point
of
the
ocean
had
a
hoard
of
dollars
beneath
it
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
in
about
eighteen
months
we
should
see
a
snug
covered
leading
direct
to
the
spot
i
was
told
at
new
york
that
in
many
parts
of
the
state
it
was
usual
to
pay
the
service
of
the
presbyterian
ministers
in
the
following
manner
once
a
year
a
day
is
fixed
on
which
some
member
of
every
family
in
a
congregation
meet
at
their
house
in
the
afternoon
they
each
bring
an
offering
according
to
their
means
of
articles
necessary
for
housekeeping
the
poorer
members
leave
their
contributions
in
a
large
basket
placed
for
the
purpose
close
to
the
door
of
entrance
those
of
more
importance
and
more
calculated
to
do
honour
to
the
piety
of
the
donors
are
carried
into
the
room
where
the
company
is
assembled
sugar
coffee
tea
cheese
barrels
of
flour
pieces
of
irish
linen
sets
of
china
and
of
glass
were
among
the
articles
mentioned
to
me
as
usually
making
parts
of
these
offerings
after
the
party
is
assembled
and
the
business
of
giving
and
receiving
is
dispatched
tea
coffee
and
cakes
are
handed
round
but
these
are
not
furnished
at
any
expense
either
of
trouble
or
money
to
the
minster
for
selected
ladies
of
the
congregation
take
the
whole
arrangement
upon
themselves
these
meetings
are
called
spinning
visits
another
new
york
custom
which
does
not
seem
to
have
so
reasonable
a
cause
is
the
changing
house
once
a
year
on
the
of
may
the
city
of
new
york
has
the
appearance
of
sending
off
a
population
flying
from
the
plague
or
of
a
town
which
had
surrendered
on
condition
of
carrying
away
all
their
goods
and
chattels
rich
furniture
and
ragged
furniture
carts
waggons
and
drays
ropes
canvas
and
straw
packers
porters
and
draymen
white
yellow
and
black
occupy
the
streets
from
east
to
west
from
north
to
south
on
this
day
every
one
i
spoke
to
on
the
subject
complained
of
this
custom
as
most
annoying
but
all
assured
me
it
was
unavoidable
if
you
inhabit
a
rented
house
more
than
one
of
my
new
york
friends
have
built
or
bought
houses
solely
to
avoid
this
annual
inconvenience
there
are
a
great
number
of
negroes
in
new
york
all
free
their
emancipation
having
been
completed
in
not
even
in
philadelphia
where
the
opinions
have
been
the
most
active
and
violent
do
the
blacks
appear
to
wear
an
air
of
so
much
consequence
as
they
do
at
new
york
they
have
several
chapels
in
which
negro
ministers
officiate
and
a
theatre
in
which
none
but
negroes
perform
at
this
theatre
a
gallery
is
appropriated
to
such
whites
as
choose
to
visit
it
and
here
only
are
they
permitted
to
sit
following
in
this
with
nice
etiquette
and
equal
justice
the
arrangement
of
the
white
theatres
in
all
of
which
is
a
gallery
appropriated
solely
to
the
use
of
the
blacks
i
have
often
particularly
on
a
sunday
met
groups
of
negroes
elegantly
dressed
and
have
been
sometimes
amused
by
observing
the
very
superior
air
of
gallantry
assumed
by
the
men
when
in
attendance
on
their
to
that
of
the
whites
in
similar
circumstances
on
one
occasion
we
met
in
broadway
a
young
negress
in
the
extreme
of
the
fashion
and
accompanied
by
a
black
beau
whose
toilet
was
equally
studied
nothing
was
omitted
he
walked
beside
his
sable
goddess
uncovered
and
with
an
air
of
the
most
tender
devotion
at
the
window
of
a
handsome
house
which
they
were
passing
stood
a
very
pretty
white
girl
with
two
gentlemen
beside
her
but
alas
both
of
them
had
their
hats
on
and
one
was
smoking
if
it
were
not
for
the
peculiar
manner
of
walking
which
distinguishes
all
american
women
broadway
might
be
taken
for
a
french
street
where
it
was
the
fashion
for
very
smart
ladies
to
promenade
the
dress
is
entirely
french
not
an
article
except
perhaps
the
cotton
stockings
must
be
english
on
pain
of
being
stigmatized
as
out
of
the
fashion
every
thing
english
is
decidedly
english
materials
english
fashions
english
accent
english
manner
are
all
terms
of
reproach
and
to
say
that
an
unfortunate
looks
like
an
english
woman
is
the
cruellest
satire
which
can
be
uttered
i
remember
visiting
france
almost
immediately
after
we
had
made
the
most
offensive
invasion
of
her
territory
that
can
well
be
imagined
yet
despite
the
feelings
which
lengthened
years
of
war
must
have
engendered
it
was
the
fashion
to
admire
every
thing
english
i
suppose
family
quarrels
are
most
difficult
to
adjust
for
fifteen
years
of
peace
have
not
been
enough
to
calm
the
angry
feelings
of
brother
jonathan
towards
the
land
of
his
fathers
the
which
he
hateth
passing
well
it
is
hardly
needful
to
say
the
most
courteous
amenity
of
manner
distinguishes
the
reception
given
to
foreigners
by
the
patrician
class
of
americans
in
the
old
world
sense
of
the
term
are
the
same
every
where
and
an
american
gentleman
and
his
family
know
how
to
do
the
honours
of
their
country
to
strangers
of
every
nation
as
well
as
any
people
on
earth
but
this
class
though
it
decidedly
exists
is
a
very
small
one
and
can
not
in
justice
be
represented
as
affording
a
specimen
of
the
whole
most
of
the
houses
in
new
york
are
painted
on
the
outside
but
in
a
manner
carefully
to
avoid
disfiguring
the
material
which
it
preserves
on
the
contrary
nothing
can
be
neater
they
are
now
using
a
great
deal
of
a
beautiful
stone
called
jersey
freestone
it
is
of
a
warm
rich
brown
and
extremely
ornamental
to
the
city
wherever
it
has
been
employed
they
have
also
a
grey
granite
of
great
beauty
the
trottoir
paving
in
most
of
the
streets
is
extremely
good
being
of
large
flag
stones
very
superior
to
the
bricks
of
philadelphia
at
night
the
shops
which
are
open
till
very
late
are
brilliantly
illuminated
with
gas
and
all
the
population
seem
as
much
alive
as
in
london
or
paris
this
makes
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
evening
hours
in
philadelphia
still
more
remarkable
there
are
a
few
trees
in
different
parts
of
the
city
and
i
observed
young
ones
planted
and
guarded
with
much
care
were
they
more
abundant
it
would
be
extremely
agreeable
for
the
reflected
light
of
their
fierce
summer
sheds
intolerable
day
ice
is
in
profuse
abundance
i
do
not
imagine
that
there
is
a
house
in
the
city
without
the
luxury
of
a
piece
of
ice
to
cool
the
water
and
harden
the
butter
the
hackney
coaches
are
the
best
in
the
world
but
abominably
dear
and
it
is
necessary
to
be
on
the
in
making
your
bargain
with
the
driver
if
you
do
not
he
has
the
power
of
charging
immoderately
on
my
first
experiment
i
neglected
this
and
was
asked
two
dollars
and
a
half
for
an
excursion
of
twenty
minutes
when
i
referred
to
the
waiter
of
the
hotel
he
asked
if
i
had
made
a
bargain
no
then
i
expect
with
the
usual
look
of
triumph
that
the
yankee
has
been
too
smart
for
you
the
private
carriages
of
new
york
are
infinitely
handsomer
and
better
appointed
than
any
i
saw
elsewhere
the
want
of
smart
liveries
destroys
much
of
the
gay
effect
but
on
the
whole
a
new
york
summer
equipage
with
the
pretty
women
and
beautiful
children
it
contains
look
extremely
well
in
broadway
and
would
not
be
much
amiss
anywhere
the
luxury
of
the
new
york
aristocracy
is
not
confined
to
the
city
hardly
an
acre
of
manhatten
island
but
shows
some
pretty
villa
or
stately
mansion
the
most
chosen
of
these
are
on
the
north
and
east
rivers
to
whose
margins
their
lawns
descend
among
these
perhaps
the
loveliest
is
one
situated
in
the
beautiful
village
of
bloomingdale
here
within
the
space
of
sixteen
acres
almost
every
variety
of
garden
scenery
may
be
found
to
describe
all
its
diversity
of
hill
and
dale
of
wood
and
lawn
of
rock
and
river
would
be
in
vain
nor
can
i
convey
an
idea
of
it
by
comparison
for
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
how
far
the
elegant
hospitality
which
reigns
there
may
influence
my
impression
i
know
not
but
assuredly
no
spot
i
have
ever
seen
dwells
more
freshly
on
my
memory
nor
did
i
ever
find
myself
in
a
circle
more
calculated
to
give
delight
in
meeting
and
regret
at
parting
than
that
of
woodlawn
chapter
reception
of
captain
basil
hall
book
in
the
united
states
having
now
arrived
nearly
at
the
end
of
our
travels
i
am
induced
ere
i
conclude
again
to
mention
what
i
consider
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
traits
in
the
national
character
of
the
americans
namely
their
exquisite
sensitiveness
and
soreness
respecting
everything
said
or
written
concerning
them
of
this
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
example
i
can
give
is
the
effect
produced
on
nearly
every
class
of
readers
by
the
appearance
of
captain
basil
hall
travels
in
north
america
in
fact
it
was
a
sort
of
moral
earthquake
and
the
vibration
it
occasioned
through
the
nerves
of
the
republic
from
one
corner
of
the
union
to
the
other
was
by
no
means
over
when
i
left
the
country
in
july
a
couple
of
years
after
the
shock
i
was
in
cincinnati
when
these
volumes
came
out
but
it
was
not
till
july
that
i
procured
a
copy
of
them
one
bookseller
to
whom
i
applied
told
me
that
he
had
had
a
few
copies
before
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
work
but
that
after
becoming
acquainted
with
it
nothing
should
induce
him
to
sell
another
other
persons
of
his
profession
must
however
have
been
less
scrupulous
for
the
book
was
read
in
city
town
village
and
hamlet
and
and
a
sort
of
was
sent
forth
perfectly
unprecedented
in
my
recollection
upon
any
occasion
whatever
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
i
did
not
procure
these
volumes
till
i
had
heard
them
very
generally
spoken
of
for
the
curiosity
i
felt
to
know
the
contents
of
a
work
so
violently
anathematised
led
me
to
make
enquiries
which
elicited
a
great
deal
of
curious
feeling
an
ardent
desire
for
approbation
and
delicate
sensitiveness
under
censure
have
always
i
believe
been
considered
as
amiable
traits
of
character
but
the
condition
into
which
the
appearance
of
capt
hall
work
threw
the
republic
shows
plainly
that
these
feelings
if
carried
to
excess
produce
a
weakness
which
amounts
to
imbecility
it
was
perfectly
astonishing
to
hear
men
who
on
other
subjects
were
sane
of
judgment
utter
their
opinions
upon
this
i
never
heard
of
any
instance
in
which
the
common
sense
generally
found
in
national
criticism
was
so
overthrown
by
passion
i
do
not
speak
of
the
want
of
justice
and
of
fair
and
liberal
interpretation
these
perhaps
were
hardly
to
be
expected
other
nations
have
been
called
but
the
citizens
of
the
union
have
apparently
no
skins
at
all
they
wince
if
a
breeze
blows
over
them
unless
it
be
tempered
with
adulation
it
was
not
therefore
very
surprising
that
the
acute
and
forcible
observations
of
a
traveller
they
knew
would
be
listened
to
should
be
received
testily
the
extraordinary
features
of
the
business
were
first
the
excess
of
the
rage
into
which
they
lashed
themselves
and
secondly
the
puerility
of
the
inventions
by
which
they
attempted
to
account
for
the
severity
with
which
they
fancied
they
had
been
treated
not
content
with
declaring
that
the
volumes
contained
no
word
of
truth
from
beginning
to
end
which
is
an
assertion
i
heard
made
very
nearly
as
often
as
they
were
mentioned
the
whole
country
set
to
work
to
discover
the
causes
why
capt
hall
had
visited
the
united
states
and
why
he
had
published
his
book
i
have
heard
it
said
with
as
much
precision
and
gravity
as
if
the
statement
had
been
conveyed
by
an
official
report
that
capt
hall
had
been
sent
out
by
the
british
government
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
growing
admiration
of
england
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
it
was
by
a
commission
from
the
treasury
he
had
come
and
that
it
was
only
in
obedience
to
orders
that
he
had
found
anything
to
object
to
i
do
not
give
this
as
the
gossip
of
a
coterie
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
the
belief
of
a
very
considerable
portion
of
the
country
so
deep
is
the
conviction
of
this
singular
people
that
they
can
not
be
seen
without
being
admired
that
they
will
not
admit
the
possibility
that
anyone
should
honestly
and
sincerely
find
aught
to
disapprove
in
them
or
their
country
at
philadelphia
i
met
with
a
little
anonymous
book
written
to
show
that
capt
basil
hall
was
in
no
way
to
be
depended
on
for
that
he
not
only
slandered
the
americans
but
was
himself
in
other
respects
a
person
of
very
equivocal
morals
one
proof
of
this
is
given
by
a
quotation
of
the
following
playful
account
of
the
distress
occasioned
by
the
want
of
a
bell
the
commentator
calls
it
an
instance
of
shocking
coarseness
one
day
i
was
rather
late
for
breakfast
and
as
there
was
no
water
in
my
jug
i
set
off
post
haste
half
shaved
half
dressed
and
more
than
half
vexed
in
quest
of
water
like
a
seaman
on
short
allowance
hunting
for
rivulets
on
some
unknown
coast
i
went
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
and
in
the
course
of
my
researches
into
half
a
dozen
different
apartments
might
have
stumbled
on
some
lady
chamber
as
the
song
says
which
considering
the
plight
i
was
in
would
have
been
awkward
enough
another
indication
of
this
moral
coarseness
is
pointed
out
in
the
passage
where
capt
hall
says
he
never
saw
a
flirtation
all
the
time
he
was
in
the
union
the
charge
of
ingratitude
also
was
echoed
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
he
should
himself
bear
testimony
to
the
unvarying
kindness
of
the
reception
he
met
with
and
yet
find
fault
with
the
country
was
declared
on
all
hands
to
be
a
proof
of
the
most
abominable
ingratitude
that
it
ever
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
conceive
i
once
ventured
before
about
a
dozen
people
to
ask
whether
more
blame
would
not
attach
to
an
author
if
he
suffered
himself
to
be
bribed
by
individual
kindness
to
falsify
facts
than
if
despite
all
personal
considerations
he
stated
them
truly
facts
cried
the
whole
circle
at
once
facts
i
tell
you
there
is
not
a
word
of
fact
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
the
american
reviews
are
many
of
them
i
believe
well
known
in
england
i
need
not
therefore
quote
them
here
but
i
sometimes
wondered
that
they
none
of
them
ever
thought
of
translating
obadiah
curse
into
classic
american
if
they
had
done
so
only
placing
he
basil
hall
between
brackets
instead
of
he
obadiah
it
would
have
saved
them
a
world
of
trouble
i
can
hardly
describe
the
curiosity
with
which
i
sat
down
at
length
to
pursue
these
tremendous
volumes
still
less
can
i
do
justice
to
my
surprise
at
their
contents
to
say
that
i
found
not
one
exaggerated
statement
throughout
the
work
is
by
no
means
saying
enough
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
who
knows
the
country
not
to
see
that
captain
hall
earnestly
sought
out
things
to
admire
and
commend
when
he
praises
it
is
with
evident
pleasure
and
when
he
finds
fault
it
is
with
evident
reluctance
and
restraint
excepting
where
motives
purely
patriotic
urge
him
to
state
roundly
what
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
should
be
known
in
fact
captain
hall
saw
the
country
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
furnished
of
course
with
letters
of
introduction
to
the
most
distinguished
individuals
and
with
the
still
more
influential
recommendation
of
his
own
reputation
he
was
received
in
full
style
and
state
from
one
end
of
the
union
to
the
other
he
saw
the
country
in
full
dress
and
had
little
or
no
opportunity
of
judging
of
it
unhouselled
disappointed
unannealed
with
all
its
imperfections
on
its
head
as
i
and
my
family
too
often
had
captain
hall
had
certainly
excellent
opportunities
of
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
form
of
the
government
and
the
laws
and
of
receiving
moreover
the
best
oral
commentary
upon
them
in
conversation
with
the
most
distinguished
citizens
of
these
opportunities
he
made
excellent
use
nothing
important
met
his
eye
which
did
not
receive
that
sort
of
analytical
attention
which
an
experienced
and
philosophical
traveller
alone
can
give
this
has
made
his
volumes
highly
interesting
and
valuable
but
i
am
deeply
persuaded
that
were
a
man
of
equal
penetration
to
visit
the
united
states
with
no
other
means
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
national
character
than
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
he
would
conceive
an
infinitely
lower
idea
of
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
country
than
captain
hall
appears
to
have
done
and
the
internal
conviction
on
my
mind
is
strong
that
if
captain
hall
had
not
placed
a
firm
restraint
on
himself
he
must
have
given
expression
to
far
deeper
indignation
than
any
he
has
uttered
against
many
points
in
the
american
character
with
which
he
shows
from
other
circumstances
that
he
was
well
acquainted
his
rule
appears
to
have
been
to
state
just
so
much
of
the
truth
as
would
leave
on
the
minds
of
his
readers
a
correct
impression
at
the
least
cost
of
pain
to
the
sensitive
folks
he
was
writing
about
he
states
his
own
opinions
and
feelings
and
leaves
it
to
be
inferred
that
he
has
good
grounds
for
adopting
them
but
he
spares
the
americans
the
bitterness
which
a
detail
of
the
circumstances
would
have
produced
if
any
one
chooses
to
say
that
some
wicked
antipathy
to
twelve
millions
of
strangers
is
the
origin
of
my
opinion
i
must
bear
it
and
were
the
question
one
of
mere
idle
speculation
i
certainly
would
not
court
the
abuse
i
must
meet
for
stating
it
but
it
is
not
so
i
know
that
among
the
best
the
most
pious
the
most
benevolent
of
my
countrymen
there
are
hundreds
nay
i
fear
thousands
who
conscientiously
believe
that
a
greater
degree
of
political
and
religious
liberty
such
as
is
possessed
in
america
would
be
beneficial
for
us
how
often
have
i
wished
during
my
abode
in
the
united
states
that
one
of
these
conscientious
but
mistaken
reasoners
fully
possessed
of
his
country
confidence
could
pass
a
few
years
in
the
united
states
sufficiently
among
the
mass
of
the
citizens
to
know
them
and
sufficiently
at
leisure
to
trace
effects
to
their
causes
then
might
we
look
for
a
statement
which
would
teach
these
mistaken
philanthropists
to
tremble
at
every
symptom
of
democratic
power
among
us
a
statement
which
would
make
even
our
sectarians
shudder
at
the
thought
of
hewing
down
the
established
church
for
they
would
be
taught
by
fearful
example
to
know
that
it
was
the
bulwark
which
protects
us
from
the
gloomy
horrors
of
fanatic
superstition
on
one
side
and
the
still
more
dreadful
inroads
of
infidelity
on
the
other
and
more
than
all
such
a
man
would
see
as
clear
as
light
that
where
every
class
is
occupied
in
getting
money
and
no
class
in
spending
it
there
will
neither
be
leisure
for
worshipping
the
theory
of
honesty
nor
motive
strong
enough
to
put
its
restrictive
doctrine
in
practice
where
every
man
is
engaged
in
driving
hard
bargains
with
his
fellows
where
is
the
honoured
class
to
be
found
into
which
feelings
principles
and
practice
are
necessary
as
an
introduction
that
there
are
men
of
powerful
intellect
benevolent
hearts
and
high
moral
feeling
in
america
i
know
and
i
could
if
challenged
to
do
so
name
individuals
surpassed
by
none
of
any
country
in
these
qualities
but
they
are
excellent
despite
their
institutions
not
in
consequence
of
them
it
is
not
by
such
that
captain
hall
statements
are
called
slanders
nor
is
it
from
such
that
i
shall
meet
the
abuse
which
i
well
know
these
pages
will
inevitably
draw
upon
me
and
i
only
trust
i
may
be
able
to
muster
as
much
as
my
predecessor
who
asserts
in
his
recently
published
fragments
that
he
has
read
none
of
the
american
criticisms
on
his
book
he
did
wisely
if
he
wished
to
retain
an
atom
of
his
kindly
feeling
toward
america
and
he
has
assuredly
lost
but
little
on
the
score
of
information
for
these
criticisms
generally
speaking
consist
of
mere
downright
personal
abuse
or
querulous
complaints
of
his
ingratitude
and
ill
usage
of
them
complaints
which
it
is
quite
astonishing
that
any
persons
of
spirit
could
indulge
in
the
following
paragraphs
from
the
fragments
must
i
think
rather
puzzle
the
americans
possibly
they
may
think
that
captain
hall
is
quizzing
them
when
he
says
he
has
read
none
of
their
criticisms
but
i
think
there
is
in
these
passages
internal
evidence
that
he
has
not
seen
them
for
if
he
had
read
part
of
the
vituperation
of
his
travels
which
it
has
been
my
misfortune
to
peruse
he
could
hardly
have
brought
himself
to
write
what
follows
if
the
americans
still
refuse
to
shake
the
hand
proffered
to
them
in
the
true
old
john
bull
spirit
they
are
worse
folks
than
even
i
take
them
for
captain
hall
after
describing
the
hospitable
reception
he
formerly
met
with
at
a
in
new
york
goes
on
thus
if
our
hostess
be
still
alive
i
hope
she
will
not
repent
of
having
bestowed
her
obliging
attentions
on
one
who
so
many
years
afterwards
made
himself
he
fears
less
popular
in
her
land
than
he
could
wish
to
be
amongst
a
people
to
whom
he
owes
so
much
and
for
whom
he
really
feels
so
much
kindness
he
still
anxiously
hopes
however
they
will
believe
him
when
he
declares
that
having
said
in
his
recent
publication
no
more
than
what
he
conceived
was
due
to
strict
truth
and
to
the
integrity
of
history
as
far
as
his
observations
and
opinions
went
he
still
feels
as
he
always
has
and
ever
must
continue
to
feel
towards
america
the
heartiest
the
americans
are
perpetually
repeating
that
the
of
their
liberty
is
fixed
on
the
doctrine
that
every
man
is
free
to
form
his
own
opinions
and
to
promulgate
them
in
candour
and
in
moderation
is
it
meant
that
a
foreigner
is
excluded
from
these
privileges
if
not
may
i
ask
in
what
respect
have
i
passed
these
limitations
the
americans
have
surely
no
fair
right
to
be
offended
because
my
views
differ
from
their
and
yet
i
am
told
i
have
been
rudely
handled
by
the
press
of
that
country
if
my
motives
are
distrusted
i
can
only
say
i
am
sorely
belied
if
i
am
mistaken
regret
at
my
political
blindness
were
surely
more
dignified
than
anger
on
the
part
of
those
with
whom
i
differ
and
if
it
shall
chance
that
i
am
in
the
right
the
best
confirmation
of
the
correctness
of
my
views
in
the
opinion
of
indifferent
persons
will
perhaps
be
found
in
the
soreness
of
those
who
wince
when
the
truth
is
spoken
yet
after
all
few
things
would
give
me
more
real
pleasure
than
to
know
that
my
friends
across
the
water
would
consent
to
take
me
at
my
word
and
considering
what
i
have
said
about
them
as
so
much
public
matter
which
it
truly
is
agree
to
reckon
me
in
my
absence
and
they
always
did
when
i
was
amongst
them
and
i
am
sure
they
would
count
me
if
i
went
back
again
as
a
private
friend
i
differed
with
them
in
politics
and
i
differ
with
them
now
as
much
as
ever
but
i
sincerely
wish
them
happiness
individually
and
as
a
nation
i
shall
rejoice
if
they
prosper
as
the
persians
write
what
can
i
say
more
and
i
only
hope
these
few
words
may
help
to
make
my
peace
with
people
who
justly
pride
themselves
on
bearing
no
malice
as
for
myself
i
have
no
peace
to
make
for
i
have
studiously
avoided
reading
any
of
the
american
criticisms
on
my
book
in
order
that
the
kindly
feelings
i
have
ever
entertained
towards
that
country
should
not
be
ruffled
by
this
abstinence
i
may
have
lost
some
information
and
perhaps
missed
many
opportunities
of
correcting
erroneous
impressions
but
i
set
so
much
store
by
the
pleasing
recollection
of
the
journey
itself
and
of
the
hospitality
with
which
my
family
were
every
where
received
that
whether
it
be
right
or
whether
it
be
wrong
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
read
anything
which
might
disturb
these
agreeable
associations
so
let
us
part
in
peace
or
rather
let
us
meet
again
in
cordial
communication
and
if
this
little
work
shall
find
its
way
across
the
atlantic
i
hope
it
will
be
read
there
without
reference
to
anything
that
has
passed
between
us
or
at
all
events
with
reference
only
to
those
parts
of
our
former
intercourse
which
are
satisfactory
to
all
parties
i
really
think
it
is
impossible
to
read
not
only
this
passage
but
many
others
in
these
delightful
little
volumes
without
feeling
that
their
author
is
as
little
likely
to
deserve
the
imputation
of
harshness
and
as
any
man
that
ever
lived
in
reading
capt
hall
volumes
on
america
the
observation
which
i
think
struck
me
the
most
forcibly
and
which
certainly
came
the
most
completely
home
to
my
own
feelings
was
the
following
in
all
my
travels
both
amongst
heathens
and
amongst
christians
i
have
never
encountered
any
people
by
whom
i
found
it
nearly
so
difficult
to
make
myself
understood
as
by
the
americans
i
have
conversed
in
london
and
in
paris
with
foreigners
of
many
nations
and
often
through
the
misty
medium
of
an
idiom
imperfectly
understood
but
i
remember
no
instance
in
which
i
found
the
same
difficulty
in
conveying
my
sentiments
my
impressions
and
my
opinions
to
those
around
me
as
i
did
in
america
whatever
faith
may
be
given
to
my
assertion
no
one
who
has
not
visited
the
country
can
possibly
conceive
to
what
extent
it
is
true
it
is
less
necessary
i
imagine
for
the
mutual
understanding
of
persons
conversing
together
that
the
language
should
be
the
same
than
that
their
ordinary
mode
of
thinking
and
habits
of
life
should
in
some
degree
assimilate
whereas
in
point
of
fact
there
is
hardly
a
single
point
of
sympathy
between
the
americans
and
us
but
whatever
the
cause
the
fact
is
certainly
as
i
have
stated
it
and
herein
i
think
rests
the
only
apology
for
the
preposterous
and
undignified
anger
felt
and
expressed
against
capt
hall
work
they
really
can
not
even
if
they
wished
it
enter
into
any
of
his
views
or
comprehend
his
most
ordinary
feelings
and
therefore
they
can
not
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
the
impressions
he
describes
the
candour
which
he
expresses
and
evidently
feels
they
mistake
for
irony
or
totally
distrust
his
unwillingness
to
give
pain
to
persons
from
whom
he
has
received
kindness
they
scornfully
reject
as
affectation
and
although
they
must
know
right
well
in
their
own
secret
hearts
how
infinitely
more
they
lay
at
his
mercy
than
he
has
chosen
to
betray
they
pretend
even
to
themselves
that
he
has
exaggerated
the
bad
points
of
their
character
and
institutions
whereas
the
truth
is
that
he
has
let
them
off
with
a
degree
of
tenderness
which
may
be
quite
suitable
for
him
to
exercise
however
little
merited
while
at
the
same
time
he
has
most
industriously
magnified
their
merits
whenever
he
could
possibly
find
anything
favourable
one
can
perfectly
well
understand
why
capt
hall
avowed
tory
principles
should
be
disapproved
of
in
the
united
states
especially
as
with
a
questionable
policy
in
a
bookselling
point
of
view
in
these
reforming
times
he
volunteers
a
profession
of
political
faith
in
which
to
use
the
kentucky
phrase
he
goes
the
whole
hog
and
bluntly
avows
in
his
concluding
chapter
that
he
not
only
holds
stoutly
to
church
and
state
but
that
he
conceives
the
english
house
of
commons
to
be
if
not
quite
perfect
at
least
as
much
so
for
all
the
required
purposes
of
representation
as
it
can
by
possibility
be
made
in
practice
such
a
downright
tory
and
pretending
to
judge
of
the
workings
of
the
american
democratical
system
was
naturally
held
to
be
a
monstrous
abomination
and
it
has
been
visited
accordingly
both
in
america
and
as
i
understand
with
us
also
the
experience
which
capt
hall
has
acquired
in
visits
to
every
part
of
the
world
during
twenty
or
thirty
years
goes
for
nothing
with
the
radicals
on
either
side
the
atlantic
on
the
contrary
precisely
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
that
authority
which
is
the
result
of
actual
observation
are
they
irritated
to
find
its
weight
cast
into
the
opposite
scale
had
not
capt
hall
been
converted
by
what
he
saw
in
north
america
from
the
whig
faith
he
exhibited
in
his
description
of
south
america
his
book
would
have
been
far
more
popular
in
england
during
the
last
two
years
of
public
excitement
it
may
perhaps
be
long
before
any
justice
is
done
to
capt
hall
book
in
the
united
states
but
a
less
time
will
probably
suffice
to
establish
its
claim
to
attention
at

and
to
find
reality
flat
after
description
but
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
man
to
paint
with
a
strength
exceeding
that
of
nature
in
such
scenes
as
the
hudson
presents
every
mile
shows
some
new
and
startling
effect
of
the
combination
of
rocks
trees
and
water
there
is
no
interval
of
flat
or
insipid
scenery
from
the
moment
you
enter
upon
the
river
at
new
york
to
that
of
quitting
it
at
albany
a
distance
of
miles
for
the
first
twenty
miles
the
shore
of
new
jersey
on
the
left
offers
almost
a
continued
wall
of
trap
rock
which
from
its
perpendicular
form
and
lineal
fissures
is
called
the
palisados
this
wall
sometimes
rises
to
the
height
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
sometimes
sinks
down
to
twenty
here
and
there
a
watercourse
breaks
its
uniformity
and
every
where
the
brightest
foliage
in
all
the
splendour
of
the
climate
and
the
season
fringed
and
chequered
the
dark
barrier
on
the
opposite
shore
manhatten
island
with
its
leafy
coronet
gemmed
with
villas
forms
a
lovely
contrast
to
these
rocky
heights
after
passing
manhatten
island
the
eastern
shore
gradually
assumes
a
wild
and
rocky
character
but
ever
varying
woods
lawns
pastures
and
towering
cliffs
all
meet
the
eye
in
quick
succession
as
the
giant
cleaves
its
swift
passage
up
the
stream
for
several
miles
the
voyage
is
one
of
great
interest
independent
of
its
beauty
for
it
passes
many
points
where
important
events
of
the
revolutionary
war
took
place
it
was
not
without
a
pang
that
i
looked
on
the
spot
where
poor
andre
was
taken
and
another
where
he
was
executed
several
forts
generally
placed
in
most
commanding
situations
still
show
by
their
battered
ruins
where
the
struggle
was
strongest
and
i
felt
no
lack
of
that
moral
interest
so
entirely
wanting
in
the
new
states
and
without
which
no
journey
can
i
think
continue
long
without
wearying
the
spirits
about
forty
miles
from
new
york
you
enter
upon
the
highlands
as
a
series
of
mountains
which
then
flank
the
river
on
both
sides
are
called
the
beauty
of
this
scenery
can
only
be
conceived
when
it
is
seen
one
might
fancy
that
these
capricious
masses
with
all
their
countless
varieties
of
light
and
shade
were
thrown
together
to
show
how
passing
lovely
rocks
and
woods
and
water
could
be
sometimes
a
lofty
peak
shoots
suddenly
up
into
the
heavens
showing
in
bold
relief
against
the
sky
and
then
a
deep
ravine
sinks
in
solemn
shadow
and
draws
the
imagination
into
its
leafy
recesses
for
several
miles
the
river
appears
to
form
a
succession
of
lakes
you
are
often
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
rocks
rising
directly
from
the
very
edge
of
the
stream
and
then
you
turn
a
point
the
river
widens
and
again
woods
lawns
and
villages
are
reflected
on
its
bosom
the
state
prison
of
sing
sing
is
upon
the
edge
of
the
water
and
has
no
picturesque
effect
to
atone
for
the
painful
images
it
suggests
the
sleepy
hollow
of
washington
irving
just
above
it
restores
the
imagination
to
a
better
tone
west
point
the
military
academy
of
the
united
states
is
fifty
miles
from
new
york
the
scenery
around
it
is
magnificent
and
though
the
buildings
of
the
establishment
are
constructed
with
the
handsome
and
unpicturesque
regularity
which
marks
the
work
of
governments
they
are
so
nobly
placed
and
so
embosomed
in
woods
that
they
look
beautiful
the
lengthened
notes
of
a
french
horn
which
i
presume
was
attending
some
of
their
military
manoeuvres
sounded
with
deep
and
solemn
sweetness
as
we
passed
about
thirty
miles
further
is
hyde
park
the
magnificent
seat
of
hosack
here
the
misty
summit
of
the
distant
kaatskill
begins
to
form
the
outline
of
the
landscape
it
is
hardly
possible
to
imagine
anything
more
beautiful
than
this
place
we
passed
a
day
there
with
great
enjoyment
and
the
following
morning
set
forward
again
in
one
of
those
grand
floating
hotels
called
steamboats
either
on
this
day
or
the
one
before
we
had
two
hundred
cabin
passengers
on
board
and
they
all
sat
down
together
to
a
table
spread
abundantly
and
with
considerable
elegance
a
continual
succession
of
gentlemen
seats
many
of
them
extremely
handsome
borders
the
river
to
albany
we
arrived
there
late
in
the
evening
but
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
excellent
accommodation
albany
is
the
state
capital
of
new
york
and
has
some
very
handsome
public
buildings
there
are
also
some
curious
relics
of
the
old
dutch
inhabitants
the
first
sixteen
miles
from
albany
we
travelled
in
a
stage
to
avoid
a
multitude
of
locks
at
the
entrance
of
the
erie
canal
but
at
scenectedy
we
got
on
board
one
of
the
canal
for
utica
with
a
very
delightful
party
of
one
own
choosing
fine
temperate
weather
and
a
strong
breeze
to
chase
the
mosquitos
this
mode
of
travelling
might
be
very
agreeable
but
i
can
hardly
imagine
any
motive
of
convenience
powerful
enough
to
induce
me
again
to
imprison
myself
in
a
canal
boat
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
accommodations
being
greatly
restricted
every
body
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
boat
acts
upon
a
system
of
unshrinking
egotism
the
library
of
a
dozen
books
the
backgammon
board
the
tiny
berths
the
shady
side
of
the
cabin
are
all
jostled
for
in
a
manner
to
make
one
greatly
envy
the
power
of
the
snail
at
the
moment
i
would
willingly
have
given
up
some
of
my
human
dignity
for
the
privilege
of
creeping
into
a
shell
of
my
own
to
any
one
who
has
been
accustomed
in
travelling
to
be
addressed
with
do
sit
here
you
will
find
it
more
comfortable
the
you
must
go
there
i
made
for
this
place
first
sounds
very
unmusical
there
is
a
great
quietness
about
the
women
of
america
i
speak
of
the
exterior
manner
of
persons
casually
met
but
somehow
or
other
i
should
never
call
it
gentleness
in
such
trying
moments
as
that
of
themselves
on
board
a
the
men
are
prompt
determined
and
will
compromise
any
convenience
except
their
own
the
women
are
doggedly
stedfast
in
their
will
and
till
matters
are
settled
look
like
hedgehogs
with
every
quill
raised
and
firmly
set
as
if
to
forbid
the
approach
of
any
one
who
might
wish
to
rub
them
down
in
circumstances
where
an
english
woman
would
look
proud
and
a
french
woman
an
american
lady
looks
grim
even
the
youngest
and
the
prettiest
can
set
their
lips
and
knit
their
brows
and
look
as
hard
and
unsocial
as
their
grandmothers
though
not
in
the
yankee
or
new
england
country
we
were
bordering
upon
it
sufficiently
to
meet
in
the
stages
and
boats
many
delightful
specimens
of
this
most
peculiar
race
i
like
them
extremely
well
but
i
would
not
wish
to
have
any
business
transactions
with
them
if
i
could
avoid
it
lest
to
use
their
own
phrase
they
should
be
too
smart
for
me
it
is
by
no
means
rare
to
meet
elsewhere
in
this
world
of
our
people
who
push
acuteness
to
the
verge
of
honesty
and
sometimes
perhaps
a
little
bit
beyond
but
i
believe
the
yankee
is
the
only
one
who
will
be
found
to
boast
of
doing
so
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
give
a
clear
and
just
idea
of
a
yankee
if
you
hear
his
character
from
a
virginian
you
will
believe
him
a
devil
if
you
listen
to
it
from
himself
you
might
fancy
him
a
god
though
a
tricky
one
mercury
turned
righteous
and
notable
matthews
did
very
well
as
far
as
i
expect
i
calculate
and
i
guess
but
this
is
only
the
shell
there
is
an
immense
deal
within
both
of
sweet
and
bitter
in
acuteness
cautiousness
industry
and
perseverance
he
resembles
the
scotch
in
habits
of
frugal
neatness
he
resembles
the
dutch
in
love
of
lucre
he
doth
greatly
resemble
the
sons
of
abraham
but
in
frank
admission
and
superlative
admiration
of
all
his
own
peculiarities
he
is
like
nothing
on
earth
but
himself
the
quakers
have
been
celebrated
for
the
pertinacity
with
which
they
avoid
giving
a
direct
answer
but
what
quaker
could
ever
vie
with
a
yankee
in
this
sort
of
fencing
nothing
in
fact
can
equal
their
skill
in
evading
a
question
excepting
that
with
which
they
set
about
asking
one
i
am
afraid
that
in
repeating
a
conversation
which
i
overheard
on
board
the
erie
canal
boat
i
shall
spoil
it
by
forgetting
some
of
the
little
delicate
doublings
which
delighted
me
yet
i
wrote
it
down
immediately
both
parties
were
yankees
but
strangers
to
each
other
one
of
them
having
by
gentle
degrees
made
himself
pretty
well
acquaninted
with
the
point
from
which
every
one
on
board
had
started
and
that
for
which
he
was
bound
at
last
attacked
his
brother
reynard
thus
well
now
which
way
may
you
be
travelling
i
expect
this
canal
runs
pretty
nearly
west
are
you
going
far
with
it
well
now
i
do
rightly
know
how
many
miles
it
may
be
i
expect
you
be
from
new
york
sure
enough
i
have
been
at
new
york
often
and
often
i
calculate
then
is
not
there
as
you
stop
business
must
be
minded
in
stopping
and
in
stirring
you
may
say
that
well
i
look
then
you
be
making
for
the
springs
folks
say
as
all
the
world
is
making
for
the
springs
and
i
except
a
good
sight
of
them
is
do
you
calculate
upon
stopping
long
when
you
get
to
your
journey
end
is
my
business
must
settle
that
i
expect
i
guess
that
true
too
but
you
be
for
making
pleasure
a
business
for
once
i
calculate
my
business
do
often
lie
in
that
line
then
may
be
it
is
not
the
springs
as
takes
you
this
line
the
springs
is
a
right
elegant
place
i
reckon
it
is
your
health
i
calculate
as
makes
you
break
your
good
rules
my
health
do
trouble
me
much
i
guess
no
why
that
well
how
is
the
markets
sir
are
bread
stuffs
up
i
just
capable
to
say
a
deal
of
money
made
by
just
looking
after
the
article
at
the
fountain
head
you
may
say
that
do
you
look
to
be
making
great
dealings
in
produce
up
the
country
why
that
i
expect
is
difficult
to
know
i
calculate
you
find
the
markets
changeable
these
times
no
markets
be
very
often
without
changing
why
that
right
down
true
what
may
be
your
biggest
article
of
produce
i
calculate
generally
that
the
biggest
as
i
makes
most
by
you
may
say
that
but
what
do
you
chiefly
call
your
most
particular
branch
why
that
what
i
ca
justly
say
and
so
they
went
on
without
advancing
or
giving
an
inch
i
was
weary
of
listening
but
i
left
them
still
at
it
when
i
stepped
out
to
resume
my
station
on
a
trunk
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
where
i
scribbled
in
my
this
specimen
of
yankee
conversation
the
erie
canal
has
cut
through
much
solid
rock
and
we
often
passed
between
magnificent
cliffs
the
little
falls
of
the
mohawk
form
a
lovely
scene
the
rocks
over
which
the
river
runs
are
most
fantastic
in
form
the
fall
continues
nearly
a
mile
and
a
beautiful
village
called
the
little
falls
overhangs
it
as
many
locks
occur
at
this
point
we
quitted
the
boat
that
we
might
the
better
enjoy
the
scenery
which
is
of
the
widest
description
several
other
passengers
did
so
likewise
and
i
was
much
amused
by
one
of
our
yankees
who
very
civilly
accompanied
our
party
pointing
out
to
me
the
wild
state
of
the
country
and
apologizing
for
it
by
saying
that
the
property
all
round
thereabouts
had
been
owned
by
an
englishman
and
you
excuse
me
but
when
the
english
gets
a
spot
of
wild
ground
like
this
here
they
have
no
notions
about
it
like
us
but
the
englishman
have
sold
it
and
if
you
was
to
see
it
five
years
hence
you
would
not
know
it
again
i
engage
there
will
be
by
that
half
a
score
elegant
factories
is
a
true
shame
to
let
such
a
privilege
of
water
lie
idle
we
reached
utica
at
twelve
the
following
day
pretty
well
fagged
by
the
sun
by
day
and
a
crowded
cabin
by
night
and
without
sugar
kept
us
alive
but
for
this
delightful
recipe
feather
fans
and
eau
de
cologne
i
think
we
should
have
failed
altogether
the
thermometer
stood
at
degrees
at
two
we
set
off
in
a
very
pleasant
airy
carriage
for
trenton
falls
a
delightful
drive
of
fourteen
miles
these
falls
have
become
within
the
last
few
years
only
second
in
fame
to
niagara
the
west
canada
creek
which
in
the
map
shows
but
as
a
paltry
stream
has
found
its
way
through
three
miles
of
rock
which
at
many
points
is
feet
high
a
forest
of
enormous
cedars
is
on
their
summit
and
many
of
that
beautiful
species
of
white
cedar
which
droops
its
branches
like
the
grow
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
and
in
some
places
almost
dip
their
dark
foliage
in
the
torrent
the
rock
is
of
a
dark
grey
limestone
and
often
presents
a
wall
of
unbroken
surface
near
the
hotel
a
flight
of
very
alarming
steps
leads
down
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
on
reaching
it
you
find
yourself
enclosed
in
a
deep
abyss
of
solid
rock
with
no
visible
opening
but
that
above
your
head
the
torrent
dashes
by
with
inconceivable
rapidity
its
colour
is
black
as
night
and
the
dark
ledge
of
rock
on
which
you
stand
is
so
treacherously
level
with
it
that
nothing
warns
you
of
danger
within
the
last
three
years
two
young
people
though
surrounded
by
their
friends
have
stepped
an
inch
too
far
and
disappeared
from
among
them
as
if
by
magic
never
to
revisit
earth
again
this
broad
flat
ledge
reached
but
a
short
distance
and
then
the
perpendicular
wall
appears
to
stop
your
farther
progress
but
there
is
a
spirit
of
defiance
in
the
mind
of
man
he
will
not
be
stayed
either
by
rocks
or
waves
by
the
aid
of
gunpowder
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
rock
has
been
removed
to
afford
a
fearful
footing
round
a
point
which
when
doubled
discloses
a
world
of
cataracts
all
leaping
forward
together
in
most
magnificent
confusion
i
suffered
considerably
before
i
reached
the
spot
where
this
grand
scene
is
visible
a
chain
firmly
fastened
to
the
rock
serves
to
hang
by
as
you
creep
along
the
giddy
verge
and
this
enabled
me
to
proceed
so
far
but
here
the
chain
failed
and
my
courage
with
it
though
the
rest
of
the
party
continued
for
some
way
farther
and
reported
largely
of
still
increasing
sublimity
but
my
knees
tottered
and
my
head
swam
so
while
the
rest
crept
onward
i
sat
down
to
wait
their
return
on
the
floor
of
rock
which
had
received
us
on
quitting
the
steps
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
bare
black
rock
on
one
side
an
equal
height
covered
with
solemn
cedars
on
the
other
an
unfathomed
torrent
roaring
between
them
the
fresh
remembrance
of
the
ghastly
legend
belonging
to
the
spot
and
the
idea
of
my
children
clinging
to
the
dizzy
path
i
had
left
was
altogether
sombre
enough
but
i
had
not
sat
long
before
a
tremendous
burst
of
thunder
shook
the
air
the
deep
chasm
answered
from
either
side
again
again
and
again
i
thought
the
rock
i
sat
upon
trembled
but
the
whole
effect
was
so
exceedingly
grand
that
i
had
no
longer
leisure
to
think
of
fear
my
children
immediately
returned
and
we
enjoyed
together
the
darkening
shadows
cast
over
the
abyss
the
rival
clamour
of
the
torrent
and
the
storm
and
that
delightful
exaltation
of
the
spirits
which
sets
danger
at
defiance
a
few
heavy
rain
drops
alarmed
us
more
than
all
the
terrors
of
the
spot
or
rather
they
recalled
our
senses
and
we
retreated
by
the
fearful
steps
reaching
our
hotel
unwetted
and
unharmed
the
next
morning
we
were
again
early
a
foot
the
last
night
storm
had
refreshed
the
air
and
renewed
our
strength
we
now
took
a
different
route
and
instead
of
descending
as
before
walked
through
the
dark
forest
along
the
cliff
sufficiently
near
its
edge
to
catch
fearful
glimpses
of
the
scene
below
after
some
time
the
patch
began
to
descend
and
at
length
brought
us
to
the
shantee
commemorated
in
miss
clarence
this
is
by
far
the
finest
point
of
the
falls
there
is
a
little
balcony
in
front
of
the
shantee
literally
hanging
over
the
tremendous
whirlpool
though
frail
it
makes
one
fancy
oneself
in
safety
and
reminded
me
of
the
feeling
with
which
i
have
stood
on
one
side
a
high
gate
watching
a
roaring
bull
on
the
other
the
walls
of
this
shantee
are
literally
covered
with
autographs
and
i
was
inclined
to
join
the
laugh
against
the
egotistical
trifling
when
one
of
the
party
discovered
trollope
england
amidst
the
innumerable
scrawls
the
well
known
characters
were
hailed
with
such
delight
that
i
think
i
shall
never
again
laugh
at
any
one
for
leaving
their
name
where
it
is
possible
a
friend
may
find
it
we
returned
to
utica
to
dinner
and
found
that
we
must
either
wait
till
the
next
day
for
the
rochester
coach
or
again
submit
to
the
our
impatience
induced
us
to
prefer
the
latter
not
very
wisely
i
think
for
every
annoyance
seemed
to
increase
upon
us
the
oneida
and
the
genesee
country
are
both
extremely
beautiful
but
had
we
not
returned
by
another
route
we
should
have
known
little
about
it
from
the
canal
nothing
is
seen
to
advantage
and
very
little
is
seen
at
all
my
chief
amusement
i
think
was
derived
from
names
one
town
consisting
of
a
whiskey
store
and
a
warehouse
is
called
port
byron
at
rome
the
first
name
i
saw
over
a
store
was
remus
doing
infinite
honour
i
thought
to
the
classic
lore
of
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
but
it
would
be
endless
to
record
all
the
drolleries
of
this
kind
which
we
met
with
we
arrived
at
rochester
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
forty
miles
on
the
second
morning
after
leaving
utica
fully
determined
never
to
enter
a
canal
boat
again
at
least
not
in
america
rochester
is
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
cities
built
on
the
jack
and
principle
there
are
many
splendid
edifices
in
wood
and
certainly
more
houses
warehouses
factories
and
than
ever
were
collected
together
in
the
same
space
of
time
but
i
was
told
by
a
that
the
stumps
of
the
forest
are
still
to
be
found
firmly
rooted
in
the
cellars
the
fall
of
the
genesee
is
close
to
the
town
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
will
perhaps
be
in
the
middle
of
it
it
is
a
noble
sheet
of
water
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
feet
perpendicular
fall
but
i
looked
at
it
through
the
window
of
a
factory
and
as
i
did
not
like
that
i
was
obligingly
handed
to
the
of
a
in
short
the
great
water
privilege
has
been
so
ingeniously
taken
advantage
of
that
no
point
can
be
found
where
its
voice
and
its
movement
are
not
mixed
and
confounded
with
those
of
the
admirable
machinery
of
this
flourishing
city
the
genesee
fall
is
renowned
as
being
the
last
and
fatal
leap
of
the
adventurous
madman
sam
patch
he
had
leaped
it
once
before
and
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
river
in
perfect
safety
but
the
last
time
he
was
seen
to
falter
as
he
took
the
leap
and
was
never
heard
of
more
it
seems
that
he
had
some
misgivings
of
his
fate
for
a
pet
bear
which
he
had
always
taken
with
him
on
his
former
adventures
and
which
had
constantly
leaped
after
him
without
injury
he
on
this
occasion
left
behind
in
the
care
of
a
friend
to
whom
he
bequeathed
him
in
case
of
his
not
returning
we
saw
the
bear
which
is
kept
at
the
principal
hotel
he
is
a
noble
creature
and
more
completely
tame
than
i
ever
saw
any
animal
of
the
species
our
journey
now
became
wilder
every
step
the
unbroken
forest
often
skirted
the
road
for
miles
and
the
sight
of
a
was
an
event
yet
the
road
was
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
good
running
along
a
natural
ridge
just
wide
enough
for
it
this
ridge
is
a
very
singular
elevation
and
by
all
the
enquiry
i
could
make
the
favourite
theory
concerning
it
is
that
it
was
formerly
the
boundary
of
lake
ontario
near
which
it
passes
when
this
ridge
ceased
the
road
ceased
too
and
for
the
rest
of
the
way
to
lockport
we
were
most
painfully
jumbled
and
jolted
over
logs
and
through
bogs
till
every
joint
was
nearly
dislocated
lockport
is
beyond
all
comparison
the
strangest
looking
place
i
ever
beheld
as
fast
as
half
a
dozen
trees
were
cut
down
a
was
raised
up
stumps
still
contest
the
ground
with
pillars
and
porticos
are
seen
to
struggle
with
rocks
it
looks
as
if
the
demon
of
machinery
having
invaded
the
peaceful
realms
of
nature
had
fixed
on
lockport
as
the
on
which
they
should
strive
for
mastery
the
fiend
insists
that
the
streams
should
go
one
way
though
the
gentle
mother
had
ever
led
their
dancing
steps
another
nay
the
very
rocks
must
fall
before
him
and
take
what
form
he
wills
the
battle
is
lost
and
won
nature
is
fairly
routed
and
driven
from
the
field
and
the
rattling
crackling
hissing
spitting
demon
has
taken
possession
of
lockport
for
ever
we
slept
there
dismally
enough
i
never
felt
more
out
of
humour
at
what
the
americans
call
improvement
it
is
in
truth
as
it
now
stands
a
most
hideous
place
and
gladly
did
i
leave
it
behind
me
our
next
stage
was
to
lewiston
for
some
miles
before
we
reached
it
we
were
within
sight
of
the
british
frontier
and
we
made
our
salaams
the
monument
of
the
brave
general
brock
stands
on
an
elevated
point
near
queenstown
and
is
visible
at
a
great
distance
we
breakfasted
at
lewiston
but
felt
every
cup
of
coffee
as
a
sin
so
impatient
were
we
as
we
approached
the
end
of
our
long
pilgrimage
to
reach
the
shrine
which
nature
seems
to
have
placed
at
such
a
distance
from
her
worshippers
on
purpose
to
try
the
strength
of
their
devotion
a
few
miles
more
would
bring
us
to
the
high
altar
but
first
we
had
to
cross
the
ferry
for
we
were
determined
upon
taking
our
first
view
from
british
ground
the
niagara
river
is
very
lovely
here
the
banks
are
bold
rugged
and
richly
coloured
both
by
rocks
and
woods
and
the
stream
itself
is
bright
clear
and
unspeakably
green
in
crossing
the
ferry
a
made
many
enquiries
of
the
young
boatman
respecting
the
battle
of
queenstown
he
was
but
a
lad
and
could
remember
little
about
it
but
he
was
a
british
lad
and
his
answers
smacked
strongly
of
his
loyal
british
feeling
among
other
things
the
questioner
asked
if
many
american
citizens
had
not
been
thrown
from
the
heights
into
the
river
why
yes
there
was
a
good
many
of
them
but
it
was
right
to
show
them
there
was
water
between
us
and
you
know
it
might
help
to
keep
the
rest
of
them
from
coming
to
trouble
us
on
our
own
ground
this
phrase
our
own
ground
gave
interest
to
every
mile
or
i
believe
i
should
have
shut
my
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
that
i
might
annihilate
what
remained
of
time
and
space
between
me
and
niagara
but
i
was
delighted
to
see
british
oaks
and
british
roofs
and
british
boys
and
girls
these
latter
as
if
to
impress
upon
us
that
they
were
not
citizens
made
bows
and
courtseys
as
we
passed
and
this
little
touch
of
long
unknown
civility
produced
great
effect
see
these
dear
children
mamma
do
they
not
look
english
how
i
love
them
was
the
exclamation
it
produced
chapter
niagara

at
forsythes
first
sight
of
the
falls
goat
island
the

buffalo

erie
canandaigna
adventures
at
length
we
reached
niagara
it
was
the
brightest
day
that
june
could
give
and
almost
any
day
would
have
seemed
bright
that
brought
me
to
the
object
which
for
years
i
had
languished
to
look
upon
we
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
the
falls
till
very
near
the
hotel
which
overhangs
them
as
you
enter
the
door
you
see
behind
the
hall
an
open
space
surrounded
by
galleries
one
above
another
and
in
an
instant
you
feel
that
from
thence
the
wonder
is
visible
i
trembled
like
a
fool
and
my
girls
clung
to
me
trembling
too
i
believe
but
with
faces
beaming
with
delight
we
encountered
a
waiter
who
had
a
sympathy
of
some
sort
with
us
for
he
would
not
let
us
run
through
the
hall
to
the
first
gallery
but
ushered
us
up
stairs
and
another
instant
placed
us
where
at
one
glance
i
saw
all
i
had
wished
for
hoped
for
dreamed
of
it
is
not
for
me
to
attempt
a
description
of
niagara
i
feel
i
have
no
powers
for
it
after
one
long
stedfast
gaze
we
quitted
the
gallery
that
we
might
approach
still
nearer
and
in
leaving
the
house
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
an
english
gentleman
the
accomplished
author
of
cyril
thornton
who
had
been
introduced
to
us
at
new
york
he
had
preceded
us
by
a
few
days
and
knew
exactly
how
and
where
to
lead
us
if
any
man
living
can
describe
the
scene
we
looked
upon
it
is
himself
and
i
trust
he
will
do
it
as
for
myself
i
can
only
say
that
wonder
terror
and
delight
completely
overwhelmed
me
i
wept
with
a
strange
mixture
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
and
certainly
was
for
some
time
too
violently
affected
in
the
to
be
capable
of
much
pleasure
but
when
this
emotion
of
the
senses
subsided
and
i
had
recovered
some
degree
of
composure
my
enjoyment
was
very
great
indeed
to
say
that
i
was
not
disappointed
is
but
a
weak
expression
to
convey
the
surprise
and
astonishment
which
this
long
dreamed
of
scene
produced
it
has
to
me
something
beyond
its
vastness
there
is
a
shadowy
mystery
hangs
about
it
which
neither
the
eye
nor
even
the
imagination
can
penetrate
but
i
dare
not
dwell
on
this
it
is
a
dangerous
subject
and
any
attempt
to
describe
the
sensations
produced
must
lead
direct
to
nonsense
exactly
at
the
fall
it
is
the
fall
and
nothing
else
you
have
to
look
upon
there
are
not
as
at
trenton
mighty
rocks
and
towering
forests
there
is
only
the
waterfall
but
it
is
the
fall
of
an
ocean
and
were
pelion
piled
on
ossa
on
either
side
of
it
we
could
not
look
at
them
the
noise
is
greatly
less
than
i
expected
one
can
hear
with
perfect
distinctness
everything
said
in
an
ordinary
tone
when
quite
close
to
the
cataract
the
cause
of
this
i
imagine
to
be
that
it
does
not
fall
immediately
among
rocks
like
the
far
noisier
potomac
but
direct
and
unbroken
save
by
its
own
rebound
the
colour
of
the
water
before
this
rebound
hides
it
in
foam
and
mist
is
of
the
brightest
and
most
delicate
green
the
violence
of
the
impulse
sends
it
far
over
the
precipice
before
it
falls
and
the
effect
of
the
ever
varying
light
through
its
transparency
is
i
think
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
looked
upon
we
descended
to
the
edge
of
the
gulf
which
received
the
torrent
and
thence
looked
at
the
fall
in
profile
it
seems
like
awful
daring
to
stand
close
beside
it
and
raise
one
eyes
to
its
immensity
i
think
the
point
the
most
utterly
inconceivable
to
those
who
have
not
seen
it
is
the
centre
of
the
the
force
of
the
torrent
converges
there
and
as
the
heavy
mass
pours
in
twisted
wreathed
and
curled
together
it
gives
an
idea
of
irresistible
power
such
as
no
other
object
ever
conveyed
to
me
the
following
anecdote
which
i
had
from
good
authority
may
give
some
notion
of
this
mighty
power
after
the
last
american
war
three
of
our
ships
stationed
on
lake
erie
were
declared
unfit
for
service
and
condemned
some
of
their
officers
obtained
permission
to
send
them
over
niagara
falls
the
first
was
torn
to
shivers
by
the
rapids
and
went
over
in
fragments
the
second
filled
with
water
before
she
reached
the
fall
but
the
third
which
was
in
better
condition
took
the
leap
gallantly
and
retained
her
form
till
it
was
hid
in
the
cloud
of
mist
below
a
reward
of
ten
dollars
was
offered
for
the
largest
fragment
of
wood
that
should
be
found
from
either
wreck
five
for
the
second
and
so
on
one
morsel
only
was
ever
seen
and
that
about
a
foot
in
length
was
mashed
as
by
a
vice
and
its
edges
notched
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
what
had
become
of
the
immense
quantity
of
wood
which
had
been
precipitated
what
unknown
whirlpool
had
engulphed
it
so
that
contrary
to
the
very
laws
of
nature
no
vestige
of
the
floating
material
could
find
its
way
to
the
surface
beyond
the
is
goat
island
and
beyond
goat
island
the
american
fall
bold
straight
and
chafed
to
snowy
whiteness
by
the
rocks
which
meet
it
but
it
does
not
approach
in
sublimity
or
awful
beauty
to
the
wondrous
crescent
on
the
other
shore
there
the
form
of
the
mighty
cauldron
into
which
the
deluge
poors
the
hundred
silvery
torrents
congregating
round
its
verge
the
smooth
and
solemn
movement
with
which
it
rolls
its
massive
volume
over
the
rock
the
liquid
emerald
of
its
long
unbroken
waters
the
fantastic
wreaths
which
spring
to
meet
it
and
then
the
shadowy
mist
that
veils
the
horrors
of
its
crash
below
constitute
a
scene
almost
too
enormous
in
its
features
for
man
to
look
upon
angels
might
tremble
as
they
gazed
and
i
should
deem
the
nerves
obtuse
rather
than
strong
which
did
not
quail
at
the
first
sight
of
this
stupendous
cataract
minute
local
particulars
can
be
of
no
interest
to
those
who
have
not
felt
their
influence
for
pleasure
or
for
pain
i
will
not
tell
of
giddy
stairs
which
scale
the
very
edge
of
the
torrent
nor
of
beetling
slabs
of
table
rock
broken
and
breaking
on
which
shudder
as
you
may
you
must
take
your
stand
or
lose
your
reputation
as
a
tourist
all
these
feats
were
performed
again
and
again
even
on
the
first
day
of
our
arrival
and
most
earthly
weary
was
i
when
the
day
was
done
though
i
would
not
lose
the
remembrance
of
it
to
purchase
the
addition
of
many
soft
and
silken
ones
to
my
existence
by
four
the
next
morning
i
was
again
at
the
little
shantee
close
to
the
fall
which
seems
reared
in
water
rather
than
in
air
and
took
an
early
of
spray
much
is
concealed
at
this
early
hour
by
the
heavy
vapour
but
there
was
a
charm
in
the
very
obscurity
and
every
moment
as
the
light
increased
cloud
after
cloud
rolled
off
till
the
vast
wonder
was
again
before
me
it
is
in
the
afternoon
that
the
rainbow
is
visible
from
the
british
side
and
it
is
a
lovely
feature
in
the
mighty
landscape
the
gay
arch
springs
from
fall
to
fall
a
fairy
bridge
after
breakfast
we
crossed
to
the
american
side
and
explored
goat
island
the
passage
across
the
niagara
directly
in
face
of
the
falls
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
little
voyages
imaginable
the
boat
crosses
marvellously
near
them
and
within
reach
of
a
light
shower
of
spray
real
safety
and
apparent
danger
have
each
their
share
in
the
pleasure
felt
the
river
is
here
two
hundred
feet
deep
the
passage
up
the
rock
brings
you
close
upon
the
american
cataract
it
is
a
vast
sheet
and
has
all
the
sublimity
that
height
and
width
and
uproar
can
give
but
it
has
none
of
the
magic
of
its
rival
about
it
goat
island
has
at
all
points
a
fine
view
of
the
rapids
the
furious
velocity
with
which
they
rush
onward
to
the
abyss
is
terrific
and
the
throwing
a
bridge
across
them
was
a
work
of
noble
daring
below
the
falls
the
river
runs
between
lofty
rocks
crowned
with
unbroken
forests
this
scene
forms
a
striking
contrast
to
the
level
shores
above
the
cataract
it
appears
as
if
the
level
of
the
river
had
been
broken
up
by
some
volcanic
force
the
niagara
flows
out
of
lake
erie
a
broad
deep
river
but
for
several
miles
its
course
is
tranquil
and
its
shores
perfectly
level
by
degrees
its
bed
begins
to
sink
and
the
glassy
smoothness
is
disturbed
by
a
slight
ripple
the
inverted
trees
that
before
lay
so
softly
still
upon
its
bosom
become
twisted
and
tortured
till
they
lose
their
form
and
seem
madly
to
mix
in
the
tumult
that
destroys
them
the
current
becomes
more
rapid
at
every
step
till
rock
after
rock
has
chafed
the
stream
to
fury
making
the
green
one
white
this
lasts
for
a
mile
and
then
down
sink
the
rocks
at
once
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
the
enormous
flood
falls
after
them
god
said
let
there
be
a
cataract
and
it
was
so
when
the
river
has
reached
its
new
level
the
precipice
on
either
side
shows
a
terrific
chasm
of
solid
rock
some
beautiful
plants
are
clinging
to
its
sides
and
oak
ash
and
cedar
in
many
places
clothe
their
terrors
with
rich
foliage
this
violent
transition
from
level
shores
to
a
deep
ravine
seems
to
indicate
some
great
convulsion
as
its
cause
and
when
i
heard
of
a
burning
spring
close
by
i
fancied
the
volcanic
power
still
at
work
and
that
the
wonders
of
the
region
might
yet
increase
we
passed
four
delightful
days
of
excitement
and
fatigue
we
drenched
ourselves
in
spray
we
cut
our
feet
on
the
rocks
we
blistered
our
faces
in
the
sun
we
looked
up
the
cataract
and
down
the
cataract
we
perched
ourselves
on
every
pinnacle
we
could
find
we
dipped
our
fingers
in
the
flood
at
a
few
distance
from
its
thundering
fall
in
short
we
strove
to
fill
as
many
niches
of
memory
with
niagara
as
possible
and
i
think
the
images
will
be
within
the
power
of
recall
for
ever
we
met
many
groups
of
tourists
in
our
walks
chiefly
american
but
they
were
or
we
fancied
they
were
but
little
observant
of
the
wonders
around
them
one
day
we
were
seated
on
a
point
of
the
cliff
near
the
ferry
which
commands
a
view
of
both
the
falls
this
by
the
way
is
considered
as
the
finest
general
view
of
the
scene
one
of
our
party
was
employed
in
attempting
to
sketch
what
however
i
believe
it
is
impossible
for
any
pencil
to
convey
an
idea
of
to
those
who
have
not
seen
it
we
had
borrowed
two
or
three
chairs
from
a
neighbouring
cottage
and
amongst
us
had
gathered
a
quantity
of
boughs
which
with
the
aid
of
shawls
and
parasols
we
had
contrived
to
weave
into
a
shelter
from
the
midday
sun
so
that
altogether
i
have
no
doubt
we
looked
very
cool
and
comfortable
a
large
party
who
had
crossed
from
the
american
side
wound
up
the
steep
ascent
from
the
place
where
the
boat
had
left
them
in
doing
so
their
backs
were
turned
to
the
cataracts
and
as
they
approached
the
summit
our
party
was
the
principal
object
before
them
they
all
stood
perfectly
still
to
look
at
us
this
first
examination
was
performed
at
the
distance
of
about
a
dozen
yard
from
the
spot
we
occupied
and
lasted
about
five
minutes
by
which
time
they
had
recovered
breath
and
acquired
courage
they
then
advanced
in
a
body
and
one
or
two
of
them
began
to
examine
wrong
side
upwards
the
work
of
the
sketcher
in
doing
which
they
stood
precisely
between
him
and
his
object
but
of
this
i
think
it
is
very
probable
they
were
not
aware
some
among
them
next
began
to
question
us
as
to
how
long
we
had
been
at
the
falls
whether
there
were
much
company
if
we
were
not
from
the
old
country
and
the
like
in
return
we
learnt
that
they
were
just
arrived
yet
not
one
of
them
there
were
eight
ever
turned
the
head
even
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
most
stupendous
spectacle
that
nature
has
to
show
the
company
at
the
hotel
changed
almost
every
day
many
parties
arrived
in
the
morning
walked
to
the
falls
returned
to
the
hotel
to
dinner
and
departed
by
the
coach
immediately
after
it
many
groups
were
indescribably
whimsical
both
in
appearance
and
manner
now
and
then
a
dandy
shot
in
among
us
like
a
falling
star
on
one
occasion
when
we
were
in
the
beautiful
gallery
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
which
overlooks
the
fall
we
saw
the
booted
leg
of
one
of
this
graceful
race
protruded
from
the
window
which
commands
the
view
while
his
person
was
thrown
back
in
his
chair
and
his
head
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
i
have
repeatedly
remarked
when
it
has
happened
to
me
to
meet
any
ultra
fine
men
among
the
wilder
and
more
imposing
scenes
of
our
own
land
that
they
throw
off
in
a
great
degree
their
airs
and
their
townliness
as
some
one
cleverly
calls
these
as
if
ashamed
to
play
their
fantastic
tricks
before
the
god
of
nature
when
so
forcibly
reminded
of
his
presence
and
more
than
once
on
these
occasions
i
have
been
surprised
to
find
how
much
intellect
lurked
behind
the
inane
mask
of
fashion
but
in
america
the
effect
of
fine
scenery
upon
this
class
of
persons
is
different
for
it
is
exactly
when
amongst
it
that
the
most
strenuous
efforts
at
elegant
are
perceptible
among
the
young
exquisites
of
the
western
world
it
is
true
that
they
have
little
leisure
for
the
display
of
grace
in
the
daily
routine
of
commercial
activity
in
which
their
lives
are
passed
and
this
certainly
offers
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
fact
above
stated
fortunately
for
our
enjoyment
the
solemn
character
of
the
scene
was
but
little
broken
in
upon
by
these
gentry
every
one
who
comes
to
forsythe
hotel
except
bogle
corbet
walks
to
the
shantee
writes
their
name
in
a
book
which
is
kept
there
and
for
the
most
part
descends
by
the
spiral
staircase
which
leads
from
the
little
platform
before
it
to
the
rocks
below
here
they
find
another
shantee
but
a
few
yards
from
the
entrance
of
that
wondrous
cavern
which
is
formed
by
the
falling
flood
on
one
side
and
by
the
mighty
rock
over
which
it
pours
on
the
other
to
this
frail
shelter
from
the
wild
uproar
and
the
blinding
spray
nearly
all
the
touring
gentlemen
and
even
many
of
the
pretty
ladies
find
their
way
but
here
i
often
saw
their
noble
daring
fail
and
have
watched
them
dripping
and
draggled
turn
again
to
the
sheltering
stairs
leaving
us
in
full
possession
of
the
awful
scene
we
so
dearly
loved
to
gaze
upon
how
utterly
futile
must
every
attempt
be
to
describe
the
spot
how
vain
every
effort
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
sensations
it
produces
why
is
it
so
exquisite
a
pleasure
to
stand
for
hours
drenched
in
spray
stunned
by
the
ceaseless
roar
trembling
from
the
concussion
that
shakes
the
very
rock
you
cling
to
and
breathing
painfully
in
the
moist
atmosphere
that
seems
to
have
less
of
air
than
water
in
it
yet
pleasure
it
is
and
i
almost
think
the
greatest
i
ever
enjoyed
we
more
than
once
approached
the
entrance
to
this
appalling
cavern
but
i
never
fairly
entered
it
though
two
or
three
of
my
party
did
i
lost
my
breath
entirely
and
the
pain
at
my
chest
was
so
severe
that
not
all
my
curiosity
could
enable
me
to
endure
it
what
was
that
cavern
of
the
winds
of
which
we
heard
of
old
compared
to
this
a
mightier
spirit
than
aeolus
reigns
here
nor
was
this
spot
of
dread
and
danger
the
only
one
in
which
we
found
ourselves
alone
the
path
taken
by
the
company
to
the
shantee
which
contained
the
book
of
names
was
always
the
same
this
wound
down
the
steep
bank
from
the
gate
of
the
hotel
garden
and
was
rendered
tolerably
easy
by
its
repeated
doublings
but
it
was
by
no
means
the
best
calculated
to
manage
to
advantage
the
pleasure
of
the
stranger
in
his
approach
to
the
spot
all
others
however
seemed
left
for
us
alone
during
our
stay
we
saw
the
commencement
of
another
staircase
intended
to
rival
in
attraction
that
at
present
in
use
it
is
but
a
few
yards
from
it
and
can
in
no
way
i
think
contribute
to
the
convenience
of
the
descent
the
erection
of
the
central
shaft
of
this
spiral
stair
was
a
most
tremendous
operation
and
made
me
sick
and
giddy
as
i
watched
it
after
it
had
been
made
fast
at
the
bottom
the
carpenters
swung
themselves
off
the
rocks
by
the
means
of
ropes
to
the
beams
which
traversed
it
and
as
they
sat
across
them
in
the
midst
of
the
spray
and
the
uproar
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
life
periled
so
wantonly
but
the
work
proceeded
without
accident
and
was
nearly
finished
before
we
left
the
hotel
it
was
a
sort
of
pang
to
take
what
we
knew
must
be
our
last
look
at
niagara
but
we
had
to
do
it
as
the
americans
say
and
left
it
on
the
june
for
buffalo
the
drive
along
the
river
above
the
falls
is
as
beautiful
as
a
clear
stream
of
a
mile
in
width
can
make
it
and
the
road
continues
close
to
it
till
you
reach
the
ferry
at
black
rock
we
welcomed
almost
with
a
shout
the
british
colours
which
we
saw
for
the
first
time
on
commodore
barrie
pretty
sloop
the
which
we
passed
as
it
was
towing
up
the
river
to
lake
erie
the
commodore
being
about
to
make
a
tour
of
the
lakes
at
black
rock
we
crossed
again
into
the
united
states
and
a
few
miles
of
horrible
jolting
brought
us
to
buffalo
of
all
the
thousand
and
one
towns
i
saw
in
america
i
think
buffalo
is
the
queerest
looking
it
is
not
quite
so
wild
as
lockport
but
all
the
buildings
have
the
appearance
of
having
been
run
up
in
a
hurry
though
every
thing
has
an
air
of
great
pretension
there
are
porticos
columns
domes
and
colonnades
but
all
in
wood
every
body
tells
you
there
as
in
all
their
other
towns
and
every
body
believes
that
their
improvement
and
their
progression
are
more
rapid
more
wonderful
than
the
earth
ever
before
witnessed
while
to
me
the
only
wonder
is
how
so
many
thousands
nay
millions
of
persons
can
be
found
in
the
nineteenth
century
who
can
be
content
so
to
live
surely
this
country
may
be
said
to
spread
rather
than
to
rise
the
eagle
hotel
an
immense
wooden
fabric
has
all
the
pretension
of
a
splendid
establishment
but
its
monstrous
corridors
low
ceilings
and
intricate
chambers
gave
me
the
feeling
of
a
catacomb
rather
than
a
house
we
arrived
after
the
was
over
and
supped
comfortably
enough
with
a
gentleman
who
accompanied
us
from
the
falls
but
the
next
morning
we
breakfasted
in
a
long
low
narrow
room
with
a
hundred
persons
and
any
thing
less
like
comfort
can
hardly
be
imagined
what
can
induce
so
many
intellectual
citizens
to
prefer
these
long
silent
tables
scantily
covered
with
morsels
of
fried
ham
salt
fish
and
liver
to
a
comfortable
loaf
of
bread
with
their
wives
and
children
at
home
how
greatly
should
i
prefer
eating
my
daily
meals
with
my
family
in
an
indian
to
boarding
at
a
in
these
capacious
hotels
the
custom
however
seems
universal
through
the
country
at
least
we
have
met
it
without
a
shadow
of
variation
as
to
its
general
features
from
new
orleans
to
buffalo
lake
erie
has
no
beauty
to
my
eyes
it
is
not
the
sea
and
it
is
not
the
river
nor
has
it
the
beautiful
scenery
generally
found
round
smaller
lakes
the
only
interest
its
unmeaning
expanse
gave
me
arose
from
remembering
that
its
waters
there
so
tame
and
tranquil
were
destined
to
leap
the
gulf
of
niagara
a
dreadful
road
through
forests
only
beginning
to
be
felled
brought
us
to
avon
it
is
a
straggling
ugly
little
place
and
not
any
of
their
romes
carthages
ithacas
or
athens
ever
provoked
me
by
their
name
so
much
this
avon
flows
sweetly
with
nothing
but
whiskey
and
tobacco
juice
the
next
day
journey
was
much
more
interesting
for
it
showed
us
the
lake
of
canandaigua
it
is
about
eighteen
miles
long
but
narrow
enough
to
bring
the
opposite
shore
clothed
with
rich
foliage
near
to
the
eye
the
is
a
ridge
of
mountains
perhaps
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
lent
an
unusual
charm
to
the
scene
one
of
those
sudden
thunderstorms
so
rapid
in
approach
and
so
sombre
in
colouring
that
they
change
the
whole
aspect
of
things
in
a
moment
rose
over
the
mountains
and
passed
across
the
lake
while
we
looked
upon
it
another
feature
in
the
scene
gave
a
living
but
most
sad
interest
to
it
a
glaring
wooden
hotel
as
fine
as
paint
and
porticos
can
make
it
overhangs
the
lake
beside
it
stands
a
shed
for
cattle
to
this
shed
and
close
by
the
white
man
mushroom
palace
two
indians
had
crept
to
seek
a
shelter
from
the
storm
the
one
was
an
aged
man
whose
venerable
head
in
attitude
and
expression
indicated
the
profoundest
melancholy
the
other
was
a
youth
and
in
his
eye
there
was
a
quiet
sadness
more
touching
still
there
they
stood
the
native
rightful
lords
of
the
fair
land
looking
out
upon
the
lovely
lake
which
yet
bore
the
name
their
fathers
had
given
it
watching
the
threatening
storm
that
brooded
there
a
more
fearful
one
had
already
burst
over
them
though
i
have
mentioned
the
lake
first
the
little
town
of
canandaigua
precedes
it
in
returning
from
the
west
it
is
as
pretty
a
village
as
ever
man
contrived
to
build
every
house
is
surrounded
by
an
ample
garden
and
at
that
flowery
season
they
were
half
buried
in
roses
it
is
true
these
houses
are
of
wood
but
they
are
so
neatly
painted
in
such
perfect
repair
and
show
so
well
within
their
leafy
setting
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
admire
them
miles
farther
is
geneva
beautifully
situated
on
seneca
lake
this
too
is
a
lovely
sheet
of
water
and
i
think
the
town
may
rival
its
european
namesake
in
beauty
we
slept
at
auburn
celebrated
for
its
prison
where
the
system
of
american
discipline
originated
in
this
part
of
the
country
there
is
no
want
of
churches
every
little
village
has
its
wooden
temple
and
many
of
them
too
that
the
methodists
and
presbyterians
may
not
clash
we
passed
through
an
indian
reserve
and
the
untouched
forests
again
hung
close
upon
the
road
repeated
groups
of
indians
passed
us
and
we
remarked
that
they
were
much
cleaner
and
better
dressed
than
those
we
had
met
wandering
far
from
their
homes
the
blankets
which
they
use
so
gracefully
as
mantles
were
as
white
as
snow
we
took
advantage
of
the
loss
of
a
horse
shoe
to
leave
the
coach
and
approach
a
large
party
of
them
consisting
of
men
women
and
children
who
were
regaling
themselves
with
i
know
not
what
but
milk
made
a
part
of
the
repast
they
could
not
talk
to
us
but
they
received
us
with
smiles
and
seemed
to
understand
when
we
asked
if
they
had
mocassins
to
sell
for
they
shook
their
sable
locks
and
answered
no
a
beautiful
grove
of
butternut
trees
was
pointed
out
to
us
as
the
spot
where
the
chiefs
of
the
six
nations
used
to
hold
their
senate
our
informer
told
me
that
he
had
been
present
at
several
of
their
meetings
and
though
he
knew
but
little
of
their
language
the
power
of
their
eloquence
was
evident
from
the
great
effect
it
produced
among
themselves
towards
the
end
of
this
day
we
encountered
an
adventure
which
revived
our
doubts
whether
the
invading
white
men
in
chasing
the
poor
indians
from
their
forests
have
done
much
towards
civilizing
the
land
for
myself
i
almost
prefer
the
indigenous
manner
to
the
exotic
the
coach
stopped
to
take
in
a
lady
at
vernon
she
entered
and
completely
filled
the
last
vacant
inch
of
our
vehicle
for
we
were
eight
before
but
no
sooner
was
she
seated
than
her
came
forward
with
a
most
enormous
wooden
box
he
paused
for
a
while
to
meditate
the
possibilities
raised
it
as
if
to
place
it
on
our
laps
sunk
it
as
if
to
put
it
beneath
our
feet
both
alike
appeared
impossible
when
in
true
yankee
style
he
addressed
one
of
our
party
with
if
you
just
step
out
a
minute
i
guess
i
find
room
for
it
perhaps
so
but
how
shall
i
find
room
for
myself
afterwards
this
was
uttered
in
european
accents
and
in
an
instant
half
a
dozen
whiskey
drinkers
stepped
from
before
the
whiskey
store
and
took
the
part
of
the
that
because
you
be
english
travellers
i
expect
but
we
have
travelled
in
better
countries
than
europe
we
have
travelled
in
america
and
the
box
will
go
i
calculate
we
remonstrated
on
the
evident
injustice
of
the
proceeding
and
i
ventured
to
say
that
as
we
had
none
of
us
any
luggage
in
the
carriage
because
the
space
was
so
very
small
i
thought
a
chance
passenger
could
have
no
right
so
greatly
to
incommode
us
right
there
they
go
that
just
their
way
that
will
do
in
europe
may
be
it
sounds
just
like
english
tyranny
now
it
but
it
wo
do
here
and
thereupon
he
began
thrusting
in
the
wooden
box
against
our
legs
with
all
his
strength
no
law
sir
can
permit
such
conduct
as
this
law
exclaimed
a
gentleman
very
particularly
drunk
we
makes
our
own
laws
and
governs
our
own
selves
law
echoed
another
gentleman
of
vernon
this
is
a
free
country
have
no
laws
and
we
do
want
no
foreign
power
to
tyrannize
over
us
i
give
the
words
exactly
it
is
however
but
fair
to
state
that
the
party
had
evidently
been
drinking
more
than
an
usual
portion
of
whiskey
but
perhaps
in
whiskey
as
in
wine
truth
may
come
to
light
at
any
rate
the
people
of
the
western
paradise
follow
the
gentiles
in
this
that
they
are
a
law
unto
themselves
during
the
contest
the
coachman
sat
upon
the
box
without
saying
a
word
but
seemed
greatly
to
enjoy
the
joke
the
question
of
the
box
however
was
finally
decided
in
our
favour
by
the
nature
of
the
human
material
which
can
not
be
compressed
beyond
a
certain
degree
for
the
great
part
of
this
day
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
a
gentleman
and
his
daughter
for
our
who
were
extremely
intelligent
and
agreeable
but
i
nearly
got
myself
into
a
scrape
by
venturing
to
remark
upon
a
phrase
used
by
the
gentleman
and
which
had
met
me
at
every
corner
from
the
time
i
first
entered
the
country
we
had
been
talking
of
pictures
and
i
had
endeavoured
to
adhere
to
the
rule
i
had
laid
down
for
myself
of
saying
very
little
where
i
could
say
nothing
agreeable
at
length
he
named
an
american
artist
with
whose
works
i
was
very
familiar
and
after
having
declared
him
equal
to
lawrence
judging
by
his
portrait
of
west
now
at
new
york
he
added
and
what
is
more
madam
he
is
perfectly
i
prudently
took
a
few
moments
before
i
answered
for
the
equalling
our
immortal
lawrence
to
a
most
vile
dauber
stuck
in
my
throat
i
could
not
say
amen
so
for
some
time
i
said
nothing
but
at
last
i
remarked
on
the
frequency
with
which
i
had
heard
this
phrase
of
used
not
as
an
apology
but
as
positive
praise
well
madam
can
there
be
a
higher
praise
certainly
not
if
spoken
of
the
individual
merits
of
a
person
without
the
means
of
instruction
but
i
do
not
understand
it
when
applied
as
praise
to
his
works
not
understand
it
madam
is
it
not
attributing
genius
to
the
author
and
what
is
teaching
compared
to
that
i
do
not
wish
to
repeat
all
my
own
in
praise
of
study
and
on
the
disadvantages
of
profound
ignorance
but
i
would
willingly
if
i
could
give
an
idea
of
the
mixed
indignation
and
contempt
expressed
by
our
companion
at
the
idea
that
study
was
necessary
to
the
formation
of
taste
and
to
the
development
of
genius
at
last
however
he
closed
the
discussion
thus
there
is
no
use
in
disputing
a
point
that
is
already
settled
madam
the
best
judges
declare
that
h
portraits
are
equal
to
that
of
lawrence
who
is
it
who
has
passed
this
judgement
sir
the
men
of
taste
of
america
madam
i
then
asked
him
if
he
thought
it
was
going
to
rain
the
stages
do
not
appear
to
have
any
regular
stations
at
which
to
stop
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
these
necessary
interludes
therefore
being
generally
were
abominably
bad
we
were
amused
by
the
patient
manner
in
which
our
american
ate
whatever
was
set
before
them
without
uttering
a
word
of
complaint
or
making
any
effort
to
improve
it
but
no
sooner
reseated
in
the
stage
than
they
began
their
complaints
twas
a
shame
twas
a
robbery
twas
poisoning
folks
and
the
like
i
at
last
asked
the
reason
of
this
and
why
they
did
not
remonstrate
because
madam
no
american
gentleman
or
lady
that
keeps
an
inn
wo
bear
to
be
found
fault
with
we
reached
utica
very
late
and
very
weary
but
the
delights
of
a
good
hotel
and
perfect
civility
sent
us
in
good
humour
to
bed
and
we
arose
sufficiently
refreshed
to
enjoy
a
day
journey
through
some
of
the
loveliest
scenery
in
the
world
who
is
it
that
says
america
is
not
picturesque
i
forget
but
surely
he
never
travelled
from
utica
to
albany
i
really
can
not
conceive
that
any
country
can
furnish
a
drive
of
miles
more
beautiful
or
more
varied
in
its
beauty
the
road
follows
the
mohawk
river
which
flows
through
scenes
changing
from
fields
waving
with
plenty
to
rocks
and
woods
gentle
slopes
covered
with
cattle
are
divided
from
each
other
by
precipices
feet
high
around
the
little
falls
there
is
a
character
of
beauty
as
singular
as
it
is
striking
here
as
i
observed
of
many
other
american
rivers
the
stream
appears
to
run
in
a
much
narrower
channel
than
it
once
occupied
and
the
space
which
it
seems
formerly
to
have
filled
is
now
covered
with
bright
green
herbage
save
that
at
intervals
large
masses
of
rock
rise
abruptly
from
the
level
turf
these
are
crowned
with
all
such
trees
as
love
the
scanty
diet
which
a
rock
affords
dwarf
oak
cedars
and
the
mountain
ash
are
grouped
in
a
hundred
different
ways
among
them
each
clump
you
look
upon
is
lovelier
than
its
neighbour
i
never
saw
so
sweetly
wild
a
spot
i
was
surprised
to
hear
a
say
as
we
passed
a
point
of
peculiar
beauty
all
this
neighbourhood
belongs
or
did
belong
to
edward
ellice
an
english
member
of
parliament
but
he
has
sold
a
deal
of
it
and
now
madam
you
may
see
as
it
begins
to
improve
and
he
pointed
to
a
great
wooden
edifice
where
on
the
white
paint
cash
for
rags
in
letters
three
feet
high
might
be
seen
i
then
remembered
that
it
was
near
this
spot
that
my
yankee
friend
had
made
his
complaint
against
english
indifference
to
water
privilege
he
did
not
name
edward
ellice
but
doubtless
he
was
the
english
as
never
thought
of
improvement
i
have
often
confessed
my
conscious
incapacity
for
description
but
i
must
repeat
it
here
to
apologize
for
my
passing
so
dully
through
this
matchless
valley
of
the
mohawk
i
would
that
some
british
artist
strong
in
youthful
daring
would
take
my
word
for
it
and
pass
over
for
a
summer
pilgrimage
through
the
state
of
new
york
in
very
earnest
he
would
wisely
for
i
question
if
the
world
could
furnish
within
the
same
space
and
with
equal
facility
of
access
so
many
subjects
for
his
pencil
mountains
forests
rocks
lakes
rivers
cataracts
all
in
perfection
but
he
must
be
bold
as
a
lion
in
colouring
or
he
will
make
nothing
of
it
there
is
a
clearness
of
atmosphere
a
strength
of
a
massiveness
in
the
foliage
and
a
brilliance
of
contrast
that
must
make
a
colourist
of
any
one
who
has
an
eye
he
must
have
courage
to
dip
his
pencil
in
shadows
black
as
night
and
light
that
might
blind
an
eagle
as
i
presume
my
young
artist
to
be
an
enthusiast
he
must
first
go
direct
to
niagara
or
even
in
the
mohawk
valley
his
pinioned
wing
may
droop
if
his
fever
run
very
high
he
may
slake
his
thirst
at
trenton
and
while
there
he
will
not
dream
of
any
thing
beyond
it
should
my
advice
be
taken
i
will
ask
the
young
adventurer
on
his
return
when
he
shall
have
made
a
prodigious
quantity
of
money
by
my
hint
to
reward
me
by
two
sketches
one
shall
be
the
lake
of
canandaigua
the
other
the
indians
senate
grove
of
butternuts
during
our
journey
i
forget
on
which
day
of
it
a
particular
spot
in
the
forest
at
some
distance
from
the
road
was
pointed
out
to
us
as
the
scene
of
a
true
but
very
romantic
story
during
the
great
and
the
terrible
french
revolution
a
young
nobleman
escaped
from
the
scene
of
horror
having
with
difficulty
saved
his
head
and
without
the
possibility
of
saving
any
thing
else
he
arrived
at
new
york
nearly
destitute
and
after
passing
his
life
not
only
in
splendour
but
in
the
splendour
of
the
court
of
france
he
found
himself
jostled
by
the
busy
population
of
the
new
world
without
a
dollar
between
him
and
starvation
in
such
a
situation
one
might
almost
sigh
for
the
guillotine
the
young
noble
strove
to
labour
but
who
would
purchase
the
trembling
efforts
of
his
white
hands
while
the
sturdy
strength
of
many
a
black
hercules
was
in
the
market
he
abandoned
the
vain
attempt
to
sustain
himself
by
the
aid
of
his
and
determined
to
seek
a
refuge
in
the
forest
a
few
shillings
only
remained
to
him
he
purchased
an
axe
and
reached
the
oneida
territory
he
felled
a
few
of
the
slenderest
trees
and
made
himself
a
shelter
that
robinson
crusoe
would
have
laughed
at
for
it
did
not
keep
out
the
rain
want
of
food
exposure
to
the
weather
and
unwonted
toil
produced
the
natural
result
the
unfortunate
young
man
fell
sick
and
stretched
upon
the
reeking
earth
stifled
rather
than
sheltered
by
the
withering
boughs
which
hung
over
him
he
lay
parched
with
thirst
and
shivering
in
ague
with
the
one
last
earthly
hope
that
each
heavy
moment
would
prove
the
last
near
to
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
miserable
rest
but
totally
concealed
from
it
by
the
thick
forest
was
the
last
straggling
wigwam
of
an
indian
village
it
is
not
known
how
many
days
the
unhappy
man
had
lain
without
food
but
he
was
quite
insensible
when
a
young
squaw
whom
chance
had
brought
from
this
wigwam
to
his
hut
entered
and
found
him
alive
but
totally
insensible
the
heart
of
woman
is
i
believe
pretty
much
the
same
every
where
the
young
girl
paused
not
to
think
whether
he
were
white
or
red
but
her
fleet
feet
rested
not
till
she
had
brought
milk
rum
and
blankets
and
when
the
sufferer
recovered
his
senses
his
head
was
supported
on
her
lap
while
with
the
gentle
tenderness
of
a
mother
she
found
means
to
make
him
swallow
the
restoratives
she
had
brought
no
black
eyes
in
the
world
be
they
of
france
italy
or
even
of
spain
can
speak
more
plainly
of
kindness
than
the
large
orbs
of
a
squaw
this
is
a
language
that
all
nations
can
understand
and
the
poor
frenchman
read
most
clearly
in
the
anxious
glance
of
his
gentle
nurse
that
he
should
not
die
forsaken
so
far
the
story
is
romantic
enough
and
what
follows
is
hardly
less
so
the
squaw
found
means
to
introduce
her
white
friend
to
her
tribe
he
was
adopted
as
their
brother
speedily
acquired
their
language
and
assumed
their
dress
and
manner
of
life
his
gratitude
to
his
preserver
soon
ripened
into
love
and
if
the
chronicle
spoke
true
the
french
noble
and
the
american
savage
were
more
than
passing
happy
as
man
and
wife
and
it
was
not
till
he
saw
himself
the
father
of
many
thriving
children
that
the
exile
began
to
feel
a
wish
of
rising
again
from
savage
to
civilized
existence
my
historian
did
not
explain
what
his
project
was
in
visiting
new
york
but
he
did
so
in
the
habit
of
an
indian
and
learnt
enough
of
the
restored
tranquillity
of
his
country
to
give
him
hope
that
some
of
the
broad
lands
he
had
left
there
might
be
restored
to
him
i
have
made
my
story
already
too
long
and
must
not
linger
upon
it
farther
than
to
say
that
his
hopes
were
fulfilled
and
that
of
a
large
and
flourishing
family
some
are
settled
in
france
and
some
remain
in
america
one
of
these
i
understood
was
a
lawyer
at
new
york
while
the
hero
and
the
heroine
of
the
tale
continue
to
inhabit
the
oneida
country
not
in
a
wigwam
however
but
in
a
good
house
in
a
beautiful
situation
with
all
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
around
them
such
was
the
narrative
we
listened
to
from
a
stage
coach
companion
and
it
appears
to
me
sufficiently
interesting
to
repeat
though
i
have
no
better
authority
to
quote
for
its
truth
than
the
assertion
of
this
unknown
traveller
chapter
return
to
new
york
conclusion
the
comfortable
adelphi
hotel
again
received
us
at
albany
on
the
of
june
and
we
decided
upon
passing
the
following
day
there
both
to
see
the
place
and
to
recruit
our
strength
which
we
began
to
feel
we
had
taxed
severely
by
a
very
fatiguing
journey
in
most
oppressively
hot
weather
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
better
station
for
repose
the
rooms
were
large
and
airy
and
ice
was
furnished
in
most
profuse
abundance
but
notwithstanding
the
manifold
advantages
of
this
excellent
hotel
i
was
surprised
at
the
arrangement
communicated
to
me
by
two
ladies
with
whom
we
made
a
speaking
acquaintance
by
which
it
appeared
that
they
made
it
their
permanent
home
these
ladies
were
a
mother
and
daughter
the
daughter
was
an
extremely
pretty
young
married
woman
with
two
little
children
where
the
husbands
were
or
whether
they
were
dead
or
alive
i
know
not
but
they
told
me
they
had
been
there
above
a
year
they
breakfasted
dined
and
supped
at
the
with
from
twenty
to
a
hundred
people
as
accident
might
decide
dressed
very
smart
played
on
the
piano
in
the
public
and
assured
me
they
were
particularly
comfortable
and
well
accommodated
what
a
life
some
parts
of
the
town
are
very
handsome
the
town
hall
the
chamber
of
representatives
and
some
other
public
buildings
stand
well
on
a
hill
that
overlooks
the
hudson
with
ample
enclosures
of
grass
and
trees
around
them
many
of
the
shops
are
large
and
showily
set
out
i
was
amused
by
a
national
trait
which
met
me
at
one
of
them
i
entered
it
to
purchase
some
de
but
finding
what
was
offered
to
me
extremely
bad
and
very
cheap
i
asked
if
they
had
none
at
a
higher
price
and
better
you
are
a
stranger
i
guess
was
the
answer
the
yankees
want
low
price
that
all
they
do
stand
so
much
for
goodness
as
the
english
nothing
could
be
more
beautiful
than
our
passage
down
the
hudson
on
the
following
day
as
i
thought
of
some
of
my
friends
in
england
dear
lovers
of
the
picturesque
i
could
not
but
exclaim
que
je
vous
plains
que
je
vous
plains
vous
ne
la
verrez
pas
not
even
a
moving
panoramic
view
gliding
before
their
eyes
for
an
hour
together
in
all
the
scenic
splendour
of
drury
lane
or
covent
garden
could
give
them
an
idea
of
it
they
could
only
see
one
side
at
a
time
the
change
the
contrast
the
ceaseless
variety
of
beauty
as
you
skim
from
side
to
side
the
liquid
smoothness
of
the
broad
mirror
that
reflects
the
scene
and
most
of
all
the
clear
bright
air
through
which
you
look
at
it
all
this
can
only
be
seen
and
believed
by
crossing
the
atlantic
as
we
approached
new
york
the
burning
heat
of
the
day
relaxed
and
the
long
shadows
of
evening
fell
coolly
on
the
beautiful
villas
we
passed
i
really
can
conceive
nothing
more
exquisitely
lovely
than
this
approach
to
the
city
the
magnificent
boldness
of
the
jersey
shore
on
the
one
side
and
the
luxurious
softness
of
the
shady
lawns
on
the
other
with
the
vast
silvery
stream
that
flows
between
them
altogether
form
a
picture
which
may
well
excuse
a
traveller
for
saying
once
and
again
that
the
hudson
river
can
be
surpassed
in
beauty
by
none
on
the
outside
of
paradise
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
reached
the
city
and
it
was
with
great
satisfaction
that
we
found
our
comfortable
apartments
in
hudson
street
unoccupied
and
our
pretty
kind
irish
hostess
willing
to
receive
us
again
we
passed
another
fortnight
there
and
again
we
enjoyed
the
elegant
hospitality
of
new
york
though
now
it
was
offered
from
beneath
the
shade
of
their
beautiful
villas
in
truth
were
all
america
like
this
fair
city
and
all
no
only
a
small
proportion
of
its
population
like
the
friends
we
left
there
i
should
say
that
the
land
was
the
fairest
in
the
world
but
the
time
was
come
to
bid
it
adieu
the
important
business
of
securing
our
homeward
passage
was
to
be
performed
one
must
know
what
it
is
to
cross
the
ocean
before
the
immense
importance
of
all
the
little
details
of
accommodation
can
be
understood
the
anxious
first
look
into
the
face
of
the
captain
to
ascertain
if
he
be
gentle
or
rough
another
scarcely
less
important
in
that
of
the
steward
generally
a
sable
one
but
not
the
less
expressive
the
accurate
but
rapid
glance
of
measurement
thrown
round
the
little
another
at
the
good
or
bad
arrangement
of
the
by
which
you
are
to
stumble
up
and
stumble
down
from
cabin
to
deck
and
from
deck
to
cabin
all
this
they
only
can
understand
who
have
felt
it
at
length
however
this
interesting
affair
was
settled
and
most
happily
the
appearance
promised
well
and
the
performance
bettered
it
we
hastened
to
pack
up
our
trumpery
as
captain
mirven
unkindly
calls
the
paraphernalia
of
the
ladies
and
among
the
rest
my
six
hundred
pages
of
griffonage
there
is
enough
of
it
yet
i
must
add
a
few
more
lines
i
suspect
that
what
i
have
written
will
make
it
evident
that
i
do
not
like
america
now
as
it
happens
that
i
met
with
individuals
there
whom
i
love
and
admire
far
beyond
the
love
and
admiration
of
ordinary
acquaintance
and
as
i
declare
the
country
to
be
fair
to
the
eye
and
most
richly
teeming
with
the
gifts
of
plenty
i
am
led
to
ask
myself
why
it
is
that
i
do
not
like
it
i
would
willingly
know
myself
and
confess
to
others
why
it
is
that
neither
its
beauty
nor
its
abundance
can
suffice
to
neutralize
or
greatly
soften
the
distaste
which
the
aggregate
of
my
recollections
has
left
upon
my
mind
i
remember
hearing
it
said
many
years
ago
when
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
a
particular
residence
were
being
discussed
that
it
was
the
who
and
not
the
where
that
made
the
difference
between
the
pleasant
or
unpleasant
residence
the
truth
of
the
observation
struck
me
forcibly
when
i
heard
it
and
it
has
been
recalled
to
my
mind
since
by
the
constantly
recurring
evidence
of
its
justness
in
applying
this
to
america
i
speak
not
of
my
friends
nor
of
my
friends
friends
the
small
patrician
band
is
a
race
apart
they
live
with
each
other
and
for
each
other
mix
wondrously
little
with
the
high
matters
of
state
which
they
seem
to
leave
rather
supinely
to
their
tailors
and
tinkers
and
are
no
more
to
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
the
american
people
than
the
head
of
lord
byron
as
a
sample
of
the
heads
of
the
british
peerage
i
speak
not
of
these
but
of
the
population
generally
as
seen
in
town
and
country
among
the
rich
and
the
poor
in
the
slave
states
and
the
free
states
i
do
not
like
them
i
do
not
like
their
principles
i
do
not
like
their
manners
i
do
not
like
their
opinions
both
as
a
woman
and
as
a
stranger
it
might
be
unseemly
for
me
to
say
that
i
do
not
like
their
government
and
therefore
i
will
not
say
so
that
it
is
one
which
pleases
themselves
is
most
certain
and
this
is
considerably
more
important
than
pleasing
all
the
travelling
old
ladies
in
the
world
i
entered
the
country
at
new
orleans
remained
for
more
than
two
years
west
of
the
alleghanies
and
passed
another
year
among
the
atlantic
cities
and
the
country
around
them
i
conversed
during
this
time
with
citizens
of
all
orders
and
degrees
and
i
never
heard
from
any
one
a
single
disparaging
word
against
their
government
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
when
the
people
of
that
country
hear
strangers
questioning
the
wisdom
of
their
institutions
and
expressing
disapprobation
at
some
of
their
effects
they
should
set
it
down
either
to
an
incapacity
of
judging
or
a
malicious
feeling
of
envy
and
how
can
any
one
in
their
senses
doubt
the
excellence
of
a
a
government
which
we
have
tried
for
half
a
century
and
loved
the
better
the
longer
we
have
known
it
such
is
the
natural
enquiry
of
every
american
when
the
excellence
of
their
government
is
doubted
and
i
am
inclined
to
answer
that
no
one
in
their
senses
who
has
visited
the
country
and
known
the
people
can
doubt
its
fitness
for
them
such
as
they
now
are
or
its
utter
unfitness
for
any
other
whether
the
government
has
made
the
people
what
they
are
or
whether
the
people
have
made
the
government
what
it
is
to
suit
themselves
i
know
not
but
if
the
latter
they
have
shown
a
consummation
of
wisdom
which
the
assembled
world
may
look
upon
and
admire
it
is
a
matter
of
historical
notoriety
that
the
original
stock
of
the
white
population
now
inhabiting
the
united
states
were
persons
who
had
banished
themselves
or
were
banished
from
the
mother
country
the
land
they
found
was
favourable
to
their
increase
and
prosperity
the
colony
grew
and
flourished
years
rolled
on
and
the
children
the
and
the
great
of
the
first
settlers
replenished
the
land
and
found
it
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
that
they
should
wish
to
keep
this
milk
and
honey
to
themselves
is
not
very
surprising
what
did
the
mother
country
do
for
them
she
sent
them
out
gay
and
gallant
officers
to
guard
their
frontier
the
which
they
thought
they
could
guard
as
well
themselves
and
then
she
taxed
their
tea
now
this
was
disagreeable
and
to
atone
for
it
the
distant
colony
had
no
great
share
in
her
mother
grace
and
glory
it
was
not
from
among
them
that
her
high
and
mighty
were
chosen
the
rays
which
emanated
from
that
bright
sun
of
honour
the
british
throne
reached
them
but
feebly
they
knew
not
they
cared
not
for
her
kings
nor
her
heroes
their
thriftiest
trader
was
their
noblest
man
the
holy
seats
of
learning
were
but
the
cradles
of
superstition
the
splendour
of
the
aristocracy
but
a
leech
that
drew
their
golden
blood
the
wealth
the
learning
the
glory
of
britain
was
to
them
nothing
the
having
their
own
way
every
thing
can
any
blame
their
wish
to
obtain
it
can
any
lament
that
they
succeeded
and
now
the
day
was
their
own
what
should
they
do
next
their
elders
drew
together
and
said
let
us
make
a
government
that
shall
suit
us
all
let
it
be
rude
and
rough
and
noisy
let
it
not
affect
either
dignity
glory
or
splendour
let
it
interfere
with
no
man
will
nor
meddle
with
any
man
business
let
us
have
neither
tithes
nor
taxes
game
laws
nor
poor
laws
let
every
man
have
a
hand
in
making
the
laws
and
no
man
be
troubled
about
keeping
them
let
not
our
magistrates
wear
purple
nor
our
judges
ermine
if
a
man
grow
rich
let
us
take
care
that
his
grandson
be
poor
and
then
we
shall
all
keep
equal
let
every
man
take
care
of
himself
and
if
england
should
come
to
bother
us
again
why
then
we
will
fight
altogether
could
any
thing
be
better
imagined
than
such
a
government
for
a
people
so
circumstanced
or
is
it
strange
that
they
are
contented
with
it
still
less
is
it
strange
that
those
who
have
lived
in
the
repose
of
order
and
felt
secure
that
their
country
could
go
on
very
well
and
its
business
proceed
without
their
bawling
and
squalling
scratching
and
scrambling
to
help
it
should
bless
the
gods
that
they
are
not
republicans
so
far
all
is
well
that
they
should
prefer
a
constitution
which
suits
them
so
admirably
to
one
which
would
not
suit
them
at
all
is
surely
no
cause
of
quarrel
on
our
part
nor
should
it
be
such
on
theirs
if
we
feel
no
inclination
to
exchange
the
institutions
which
have
made
us
what
we
are
for
any
other
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
when
a
native
of
europe
visits
america
a
most
extraordinary
species
of
tyranny
is
set
in
action
against
him
and
as
far
as
my
reading
and
experience
have
enabled
me
to
judge
it
is
such
as
no
other
country
has
ever
exercised
against
strangers
the
frenchman
visits
england
he
is
at
our
stately
dinners
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
our
de
and
laughs
gorge
at
our
passion
for
driving
and
our
partial
affection
for
roast
beef
and
plum
pudding
the
englishman
returns
the
visit
and
the
first
thing
he
does
on
arriving
at
paris
is
to
hasten
to
theatre
des
that
he
may
see
anglaises
pour
and
if
among
the
crowd
of
laughters
you
hear
a
note
of
more
cordial
mirth
than
the
rest
seek
out
the
person
from
whom
it
proceeds
and
you
will
find
the
englishman
the
italian
comes
to
our
green
island
and
groans
at
our
climate
he
vows
that
the
air
which
destroys
a
statue
can
not
be
wholesome
for
man
he
sighs
for
orange
trees
and
maccaroni
and
smiles
at
the
pretensions
of
a
nation
to
poetry
while
no
epics
are
chaunted
through
her
streets
yet
we
welcome
the
sensitive
southern
with
all
kindness
listen
to
his
complaints
with
interest
cultivate
our
little
orange
trees
and
teach
our
children
to
lisp
tasso
in
the
hope
of
becoming
more
agreeable
yet
we
are
not
at
all
superior
to
the
rest
of
europe
in
our
endurance
of
censure
nor
is
this
wish
to
profit
by
it
all
peculiar
to
the
english
we
laugh
at
and
find
fault
with
our
neighbours
quite
as
freely
as
they
do
with
us
and
they
join
the
laugh
and
adopt
our
fashions
and
our
customs
these
mutual
pleasantries
produce
no
shadow
of
unkindly
feeling
and
as
long
as
the
governments
are
at
peace
with
each
other
the
individuals
of
every
nation
in
europe
make
it
a
matter
of
pride
as
well
as
of
pleasure
to
meet
each
other
frequently
to
discuss
compare
and
reason
upon
their
national
varieties
and
to
vote
it
a
mark
of
fashion
and
good
taste
to
imitate
each
other
in
all
the
external
embellishments
of
life
the
consequence
of
this
is
most
pleasantly
perceptible
at
the
present
time
in
every
capital
of
europe
the
long
peace
has
given
time
for
each
to
catch
from
each
what
was
best
in
customs
and
manners
and
the
rapid
advance
of
refinement
and
general
information
has
been
the
result
to
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
this
state
of
things
the
contrast
upon
crossing
to
the
new
world
is
inconceivably
annoying
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
this
is
one
great
cause
of
the
general
feeling
of
irksomeness
and
fatigue
of
spirits
which
hangs
upon
the
memory
while
recalling
the
hours
passed
in
american
society
a
single
word
indicative
of
doubt
that
any
thing
or
every
thing
in
that
country
is
not
the
very
best
in
the
world
produces
an
effect
which
must
be
seen
and
felt
to
be
understood
if
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
were
indeed
the
devoted
patriots
they
call
themselves
they
would
surely
not
thus
encrust
themselves
in
the
hard
dry
stubborn
persuasion
that
they
are
the
first
and
best
of
the
human
race
that
nothing
is
to
be
learnt
but
what
they
are
able
to
teach
and
that
nothing
is
worth
having
which
they
do
not
possess
the
art
of
man
could
hardly
discover
a
more
effectual
antidote
to
improvement
than
this
persuasion
and
yet
i
never
listened
to
any
public
oration
or
read
any
work
professedly
addressed
to
the
country
in
which
they
did
not
labour
to
impress
it
on
the
minds
of
the
people
to
hint
to
the
generality
of
americans
that
the
silent
current
of
events
may
change
their
beloved
government
is
not
the
way
to
please
them
but
in
truth
they
need
be
tormented
with
no
such
fear
as
long
as
by
common
consent
they
can
keep
down
the
which
nature
has
assigned
to
great
powers
as
long
as
they
can
prevent
human
respect
and
human
honour
from
resting
upon
high
talent
gracious
manners
and
exalted
station
so
long
may
they
be
sure
of
going
on
as
they
are
i
have
been
told
however
that
there
are
some
among
them
who
would
gladly
see
a
change
some
who
with
the
wisdom
of
philosophers
and
the
fair
candour
of
gentlemen
shrink
from
a
profession
of
equality
which
they
feel
to
be
untrue
and
believe
to
be
impossible
i
can
well
believe
that
such
there
are
though
to
me
no
such
opinions
were
communicated
and
most
truly
should
i
rejoice
to
see
power
pass
into
such
hands
if
this
ever
happens
if
refinement
once
creeps
in
among
them
if
they
once
learn
to
cling
to
the
graces
the
honours
the
chivalry
of
life
then
we
shall
say
farewell
to
american
equality
and
welcome
to
european
fellowship
one
of
the
finest
countries
on
the
earth
the
end
