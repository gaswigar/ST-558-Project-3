following
this

lucien
s
story
is
continued
in
another
book
scenes
from
a
courtesan
s
life
eve
and
david
lucien
had
gone
to
paris
and
david
sechard
with
the
courage
and
intelligence
of
the
ox
which
painters
give
the
evangelist
for
accompanying
symbol
set
himself
to
make
the
large
fortune
for
which
he
had
wished
that
evening
down
by
the
charente
when
he
sat
with
eve
by
the
weir
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
her
heart
he
wanted
to
make
the
money
quickly
and
less
for
himself
than
for
eve
s
sake
and
lucien
s
he
would
place
his
wife
amid
the
elegant
and
comfortable
surroundings
that
were
hers
by
right
and
his
strong
arm
should
sustain
her
brother
s
ambitions
this
was
the
programme
that
he
saw
before
his
eyes
in
letters
of
fire
journalism
and
politics
the
immense
development
of
the
book
trade
of
literature
and
of
the
sciences
the
increase
of
public
interest
in
matters
touching
the
various
industries
in
the
country
in
fact
the
whole
social
tendency
of
the
epoch
following
the
establishment
of
the
restoration
produced
an
enormous
increase
in
the
demand
for
paper
the
supply
required
was
almost
ten
times
as
large
as
the
quantity
in
which
the
celebrated
ouvrard
speculated
at
the
outset
of
the
revolution
then
ouvrard
could
buy
up
first
the
entire
stock
of
paper
and
then
the
manufacturers
but
in
the
year
there
were
so
many
in
france
that
no
one
could
hope
to
repeat
his
success
and
david
had
neither
audacity
enough
nor
capital
enough
for
such
speculation
machinery
for
producing
paper
in
any
length
was
just
coming
into
use
in
england
it
was
one
of
the
most
urgent
needs
of
the
time
therefore
that
the
paper
trade
should
keep
pace
with
the
requirements
of
the
french
system
of
civil
government
a
system
by
which
the
right
of
discussion
was
to
be
extended
to
every
man
and
the
whole
fabric
based
upon
continual
expression
of
individual
opinion
a
grave
misfortune
for
the
nation
that
deliberates
is
but
little
wont
to
act
so
strange
coincidence
while
lucien
was
drawn
into
the
great
machinery
of
journalism
where
he
was
like
to
leave
his
honor
and
his
intelligence
torn
to
shreds
david
sechard
at
the
back
of
his
foresaw
all
the
practical
consequences
of
the
increased
activity
of
the
periodical
press
he
saw
the
direction
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
tending
and
sought
to
find
means
to
the
required
end
he
saw
also
that
there
was
a
fortune
awaiting
the
discoverer
of
cheap
paper
and
the
event
has
justified
his
clearsightedness
within
the
last
fifteen
years
the
patent
office
has
received
more
than
a
hundred
applications
from
persons
claiming
to
have
discovered
cheap
substances
to
be
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
paper
david
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
that
this
would
be
no
brilliant
triumph
it
is
true
but
a
useful
and
immensely
profitable
discovery
and
after
his
went
to
paris
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
the
problem
which
he
had
set
himself
to
solve
the
expenses
of
his
marriage
and
of
lucien
s
journey
to
paris
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
he
confronted
the
extreme
of
poverty
at
the
very
outset
of
married
life
he
had
kept
one
thousand
francs
for
the
working
expenses
of
the
business
and
owed
a
like
sum
for
which
he
had
given
a
bill
to
postel
the
druggist
so
here
was
a
double
problem
for
this
deep
thinker
he
must
invent
a
method
of
making
cheap
paper
and
that
quickly
he
must
make
the
discovery
in
fact
in
order
to
apply
the
proceeds
to
the
needs
of
the
household
and
of
the
business
what
words
can
describe
the
brain
that
can
forget
the
cruel
preoccupations
caused
by
hidden
want
by
the
daily
needs
of
a
family
and
the
daily
drudgery
of
a
printer
s
business
which
requires
such
minute
painstaking
care
and
soar
with
the
enthusiasm
and
intoxication
of
the
man
of
science
into
the
regions
of
the
unknown
in
quest
of
a
secret
which
daily
eludes
the
most
subtle
experiment
and
the
inventor
alas
as
will
shortly
be
seen
has
plenty
of
woes
to
endure
besides
the
ingratitude
of
the
many
idle
folk
that
can
do
nothing
themselves
tell
them
such
a
one
is
a
born
inventor
he
could
not
do
otherwise
he
no
more
deserves
credit
for
his
invention
than
a
prince
for
being
born
to
rule
he
is
simply
exercising
his
natural
faculties
and
his
work
is
its
own
reward
and
the
people
believe
them
marriage
brings
profound
mental
and
physical
perturbations
into
a
girl
s
life
and
if
she
marries
under
the
ordinary
conditions
of
lower
life
she
must
moreover
begin
to
study
totally
new
interests
and
initiate
herself
in
the
intricacies
of
business
with
marriage
therefore
she
enters
upon
a
phase
of
her
existence
when
she
is
necessarily
on
the
watch
before
she
can
act
unfortunately
david
s
love
for
his
wife
retarded
this
training
he
dared
not
tell
her
the
real
state
of
affairs
on
the
day
after
their
wedding
nor
for
some
time
afterwards
his
father
s
avarice
condemned
him
to
the
most
grinding
poverty
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
spoil
the
honeymoon
by
beginning
his
wife
s
commercial
education
and
prosaic
apprenticeship
to
his
laborious
craft
so
it
came
to
pass
that
housekeeping
no
less
than
working
expenses
ate
up
the
thousand
francs
his
whole
fortune
for
four
months
david
gave
no
thought
to
the
future
and
his
wife
remained
in
ignorance
the
awakening
was
terrible
postel
s
bill
fell
due
there
was
no
money
to
meet
it
and
eve
knew
enough
of
the
debt
and
its
cause
to
give
up
her
bridal
trinkets
and
silver
that
evening
eve
tried
to
induce
david
to
talk
of
their
affairs
for
she
had
noticed
that
he
was
giving
less
attention
to
the
business
and
more
to
the
problem
of
which
he
had
once
spoken
to
her
since
the
first
few
weeks
of
married
life
in
fact
david
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
shed
in
the
backyard
in
the
little
room
where
he
was
wont
to
mould
his
three
months
after
his
return
to
angouleme
he
had
replaced
the
old
fashioned
round
by
rollers
made
of
strong
glue
and
treacle
and
an
on
which
the
ink
was
evenly
distributed
an
improvement
so
obvious
that
cointet
brothers
no
sooner
saw
it
than
they
adopted
the
plan
themselves
by
the
partition
wall
of
this
kitchen
as
it
were
david
had
set
up
a
little
furnace
with
a
copper
pan
ostensibly
to
save
the
cost
of
fuel
over
the
recasting
of
his
rollers
though
the
moulds
had
not
been
used
twice
and
hung
there
rusting
upon
the
wall
nor
was
this
all
a
solid
oak
door
had
been
put
in
by
his
orders
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
he
even
replaced
the
dirty
window
sash
by
panes
of
ribbed
glass
so
that
no
one
without
could
watch
him
at
his
work
when
eve
began
to
speak
about
the
future
he
looked
uneasily
at
her
and
cut
her
short
at
the
first
word
by
saying
i
know
all
that
you
must
think
child
when
you
see
that
the
workshop
is
left
to
itself
and
that
i
am
dead
as
it
were
to
all
business
interests
but
see
he
continued
bringing
her
to
the
window
and
pointing
to
the
mysterious
shed
there
lies
our
fortune
for
some
months
yet
we
must
endure
our
lot
but
let
us
bear
it
patiently
leave
me
to
solve
the
problem
of
which
i
told
you
and
all
our
troubles
will
be
at
an
david
was
so
good
his
devotion
was
so
thoroughly
to
be
taken
upon
his
word
that
the
poor
wife
with
a
wife
s
anxiety
as
to
daily
expenses
determined
to
spare
her
husband
the
household
cares
and
to
take
the
burden
upon
herself
so
she
came
down
from
the
pretty
room
where
she
sewed
and
talked
contentedly
with
her
mother
took
possession
of
one
of
the
two
dens
at
the
back
of
the
and
set
herself
to
learn
the
business
routine
of
typography
was
it
not
heroism
in
a
wife
who
expected
ere
long
to
be
a
mother
during
the
past
few
months
david
s
workmen
had
left
him
one
by
one
there
was
not
enough
work
for
them
to
do
cointet
brothers
on
the
other
hand
were
overwhelmed
with
orders
they
were
employing
all
the
workmen
of
the
department
the
alluring
prospect
of
high
wages
even
brought
them
a
few
from
bordeaux
more
especially
apprentices
who
thought
themselves
sufficiently
expert
to
cancel
their
articles
and
go
elsewhere
when
eve
came
to
look
into
the
affairs
of
sechard
s
printing
works
she
discovered
that
he
employed
three
persons
in
all
first
in
order
stood
cerizet
an
apprentice
of
didot
s
whom
david
had
chosen
to
train
most
foremen
have
some
one
favorite
among
the
great
numbers
of
workers
under
them
and
david
had
brought
cerizet
to
angouleme
where
he
had
been
learning
more
of
the
business
marion
as
much
attached
to
the
house
as
a
was
the
second
and
the
third
was
kolb
an
alsacien
at
one
time
a
porter
in
the
employ
of
the
didot
kolb
had
been
drawn
for
military
service
chance
brought
him
to
angouleme
and
david
recognized
the
man
s
face
at
a
review
just
as
his
time
was
about
to
expire
kolb
came
to
see
david
and
was
smitten
forthwith
by
the
charms
of
the
portly
marion
she
possessed
all
the
qualities
which
a
man
of
his
class
looks
for
in
a
wife
the
robust
health
that
bronzes
the
cheeks
the
strength
of
a
man
marion
could
lift
a
form
of
type
with
ease
the
scrupulous
honesty
on
which
an
alsacien
sets
such
store
the
faithful
service
which
bespeaks
a
sterling
character
and
finally
the
thrift
which
had
saved
a
little
sum
of
a
thousand
francs
besides
a
stock
of
clothing
and
linen
neat
and
clean
as
country
linen
can
be
marion
herself
a
big
stout
woman
of
felt
sufficiently
flattered
by
the
admiration
of
a
cuirassier
who
stood
five
feet
seven
in
his
stockings
a
warrior
strong
as
a
bastion
and
not
unnaturally
suggested
that
he
should
become
a
printer
so
by
the
time
kolb
received
his
full
discharge
marion
and
david
between
them
had
transformed
him
into
a
tolerably
creditable
bear
though
their
pupil
could
neither
read
nor
write
job
printing
as
it
is
called
was
not
so
abundant
at
this
season
but
that
cerizet
could
manage
it
without
help
cerizet
compositor
clicker
and
foreman
realized
in
his
person
the
phenomenal
triplicity
of
kant
he
set
up
type
read
proof
took
orders
and
made
out
invoices
but
the
most
part
of
the
time
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
used
to
read
novels
in
his
den
at
the
back
of
the
workshop
while
he
waited
for
an
order
for
a
or
a
trade
circular
marion
trained
by
old
sechard
prepared
and
wetted
down
the
paper
helped
kolb
with
the
printing
hung
the
sheets
to
dry
and
cut
them
to
size
yet
cooked
the
dinner
none
the
less
and
did
her
marketing
very
early
of
a
morning
eve
told
cerizet
to
draw
out
a
for
the
last
six
months
and
found
that
the
gross
receipts
amounted
to
eight
hundred
francs
on
the
other
hand
wages
at
the
rate
of
three
francs
per
day
two
francs
to
cerizet
and
one
to
kolb
reached
a
total
of
six
hundred
francs
and
as
the
goods
supplied
for
the
work
printed
and
delivered
amounted
to
some
hundred
odd
francs
it
was
clear
to
eve
that
david
had
been
carrying
on
business
at
a
loss
during
the
first
of
their
married
life
there
was
nothing
to
show
for
rent
nothing
for
marion
s
wages
nor
for
the
interest
on
capital
represented
by
the
plant
the
license
and
the
ink
nothing
finally
by
way
of
allowance
for
the
host
of
things
included
in
the
technical
expression
wear
and
tear
a
word
which
owes
its
origin
to
the
cloths
and
silks
which
are
used
to
moderate
the
force
of
the
impression
and
to
save
wear
to
the
type
a
square
of
stuff
the
being
placed
between
the
platen
and
the
sheet
of
paper
in
the
press
eve
made
a
rough
calculation
of
the
resources
of
the
printing
office
and
of
the
output
and
saw
how
little
hope
there
was
for
a
business
drained
dry
by
the
activity
of
the
brothers
cointet
for
by
this
time
the
cointets
were
not
only
contract
printers
to
the
town
and
the
prefecture
and
printers
to
the
diocese
by
special
appointment
they
were
and
proprietors
of
a
newspaper
to
boot
that
newspaper
sold
two
years
ago
by
the
sechards
father
and
son
for
thousand
francs
was
now
bringing
in
eighteen
thousand
francs
per
annum
eve
began
to
understand
the
motives
lurking
beneath
the
apparent
generosity
of
the
brothers
cointet
they
were
leaving
the
sechard
establishment
just
sufficient
work
to
gain
a
pittance
but
not
enough
to
establish
a
rival
house
when
eve
took
the
management
of
the
business
she
began
by
taking
stock
she
set
kolb
and
marion
and
cerizet
to
work
and
the
workshop
was
put
to
rights
cleaned
out
and
set
in
order
then
one
evening
when
david
came
in
from
a
country
excursion
followed
by
an
old
woman
with
a
huge
bundle
tied
up
in
a
cloth
eve
asked
counsel
of
him
as
to
the
best
way
of
turning
to
profit
the
odds
and
ends
left
them
by
old
sechard
promising
that
she
herself
would
look
after
the
business
acting
upon
her
husband
s
advice
mme
sechard
sorted
all
the
remnants
of
paper
which
she
found
and
printed
old
popular
legends
in
double
columns
upon
a
single
sheet
such
as
peasants
paste
on
their
walls
the
histories
of
wandering
the
belle
and
sundry
miracles
eve
sent
kolb
out
as
a
hawker
cerizet
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
now
he
was
composing
the
naive
pages
with
the
rough
cuts
that
adorned
them
from
morning
to
night
marion
was
able
to
manage
the
taking
off
and
all
domestic
cares
fell
to
mme
chardon
for
eve
was
busy
coloring
the
prints
thanks
to
kolb
s
activity
and
honesty
eve
sold
three
thousand
broad
sheets
at
a
penny
apiece
and
made
three
hundred
francs
in
all
at
a
cost
of
thirty
francs
but
when
every
peasant
s
hut
and
every
little
for
twenty
leagues
round
was
papered
with
these
legends
a
fresh
speculation
must
be
discovered
the
alsacien
could
not
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
department
eve
turning
over
everything
in
the
whole
printing
house
had
found
a
collection
of
figures
for
printing
a
shepherd
s
calendar
a
kind
of
almanac
meant
for
those
who
can
not
read
letterpress
being
replaced
by
symbols
signs
and
pictures
in
colored
inks
red
black
and
blue
old
sechard
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
himself
had
made
a
good
deal
of
money
at
one
time
by
bringing
out
an
almanac
in
hieroglyph
it
was
in
book
form
a
single
sheet
folded
to
make
one
hundred
and
pages
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
success
of
the
broad
sheets
a
piece
of
business
only
undertaken
by
country
printing
offices
mme
sechard
invested
all
the
proceeds
in
the
s
and
began
it
upon
a
large
scale
millions
of
copies
of
this
work
are
sold
annually
in
france
it
is
printed
upon
even
coarser
paper
than
the
of
a
ream
five
hundred
sheets
costing
in
the
first
instance
about
four
francs
while
the
printed
sheets
sell
at
the
rate
of
a
halfpenny
apiece
francs
per
ream
mme
sechard
determined
to
use
one
hundred
reams
for
the
first
impression
fifty
thousand
copies
would
bring
in
two
thousand
francs
a
man
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
work
as
david
in
his
researches
is
seldom
observant
yet
david
taking
a
look
round
his
workshop
was
astonished
to
hear
the
groaning
of
a
press
and
to
see
cerizet
always
on
his
feet
setting
up
type
under
mme
sechard
s
direction
there
was
a
pretty
triumph
for
eve
on
the
day
when
david
came
in
to
see
what
she
was
doing
and
praised
the
idea
and
thought
the
calendar
an
excellent
stroke
of
business
furthermore
david
promised
to
give
advice
in
the
matter
of
colored
inks
for
an
almanac
meant
to
appeal
to
the
eye
and
finally
he
resolved
to
recast
the
himself
in
his
mysterious
workshop
so
as
to
help
his
wife
as
far
as
he
could
in
her
important
little
enterprise
but
just
as
the
work
began
with
strenuous
industry
there
came
letters
from
lucien
in
paris
letters
that
told
his
mother
and
sister
and
of
his
failure
and
distress
and
when
eve
mme
chardon
and
david
each
secretly
sent
money
to
their
poet
it
must
be
plain
to
the
reader
that
the
three
hundred
francs
they
sent
were
like
their
very
blood
the
overwhelming
news
the
disheartening
sense
that
work
as
bravely
as
she
might
she
made
so
little
left
eve
looking
forward
with
a
certain
dread
to
an
event
which
fills
the
cup
of
happiness
to
the
full
the
time
was
coming
very
near
now
and
to
herself
she
said
if
my
dear
david
has
not
reached
the
end
of
his
researches
before
my
confinement
what
will
become
of
us
and
who
will
look
after
our
poor
printing
office
and
the
business
that
is
growing
up
the
s
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
ready
before
the
of
january
but
cerizet
was
working
unaccountably
slowly
all
the
work
of
composing
fell
to
him
and
mme
sechard
knowing
so
little
could
not
find
fault
and
was
fain
to
content
herself
with
watching
the
young
parisian
cerizet
came
from
the
great
foundling
hospital
in
paris
he
had
been
apprenticed
to
the
mm
didot
and
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
seventeen
he
was
david
sechard
s
fanatical
worshiper
david
put
him
under
one
of
the
cleverest
workmen
and
took
him
for
his
his
page
cerizet
s
intelligence
naturally
interested
david
he
won
the
lad
s
affection
by
procuring
amusements
now
and
again
for
him
and
comforts
from
which
he
was
cut
off
by
poverty
nature
had
endowed
cerizet
with
an
insignificant
rather
pretty
little
countenance
red
hair
and
a
pair
of
dull
blue
eyes
he
had
come
to
angouleme
and
brought
the
manners
of
the
parisian
with
him
he
was
formidable
by
reason
of
a
quick
sarcastic
turn
and
a
spiteful
disposition
perhaps
david
looked
less
strictly
after
him
in
angouleme
or
perhaps
as
the
lad
grew
older
his
mentor
put
more
trust
in
him
or
in
the
sobering
influences
of
a
country
town
but
be
that
as
it
may
cerizet
all
unknown
to
his
sponsor
was
going
completely
to
the
bad
and
the
printer
s
apprentice
was
acting
the
part
of
a
don
juan
among
little
work
girls
his
morality
learned
in
paris
laid
down
the
law
of
as
the
sole
rule
of
guidance
he
knew
moreover
that
next
year
he
would
be
drawn
for
a
soldier
to
use
the
popular
expression
saw
that
he
had
no
prospects
and
ran
into
debt
thinking
that
soon
he
should
be
in
the
army
and
none
of
his
creditors
would
run
after
him
david
still
possessed
some
ascendency
over
the
young
fellow
due
not
to
his
position
as
master
nor
yet
to
the
interest
that
he
had
taken
in
his
pupil
but
to
the
great
intellectual
power
which
the
sometime
fully
recognized
before
long
cerizet
began
to
fraternize
with
the
cointets
workpeople
drawn
to
them
by
the
mutual
attraction
of
blouse
and
jacket
and
the
class
feeling
which
is
perhaps
strongest
of
all
in
the
lowest
ranks
of
society
in
their
company
cerizet
forgot
the
little
good
doctrine
which
david
had
managed
to
instil
into
him
but
nevertheless
when
the
others
joked
the
boy
about
the
presses
in
his
workshop
old
sabots
as
the
bears
contemptuously
called
them
and
showed
him
the
magnificent
machines
twelve
in
number
now
at
work
in
the
cointets
great
printing
office
where
the
single
wooden
press
was
only
used
for
experiments
cerizet
would
stand
up
for
david
and
fling
out
at
the
braggarts
my
gaffer
will
go
farther
with
his
sabots
than
yours
with
their
contrivances
that
turn
out
mass
books
all
day
long
he
would
boast
he
is
trying
to
find
out
a
secret
that
will
lick
all
the
printing
offices
in
france
and
and
meantime
you
take
your
orders
from
a
you
snip
of
a
foreman
on
two
francs
a
she
is
pretty
though
retorted
cerizet
it
is
better
to
have
her
to
look
at
than
the
phizes
of
your
and
do
you
live
by
looking
at
his
wife
from
the
region
of
the
wineshop
or
from
the
door
of
the
printing
office
where
these
bickerings
took
place
a
dim
light
began
to
break
in
upon
the
brothers
cointet
as
to
the
real
state
of
things
in
the
sechard
establishment
they
came
to
hear
of
eve
s
experiment
and
held
it
expedient
to
stop
these
flights
at
once
lest
the
business
should
begin
to
prosper
under
the
poor
young
wife
s
management
let
us
give
her
a
rap
over
the
knuckles
and
disgust
her
with
the
business
said
the
brothers
cointet
one
of
the
pair
the
practical
printer
spoke
to
cerizet
and
asked
him
to
do
the
for
them
by
piecework
to
relieve
their
reader
who
had
more
than
he
could
manage
so
it
came
to
pass
that
cerizet
earned
more
by
a
few
hours
work
of
an
evening
for
the
brothers
cointet
than
by
a
whole
day
s
work
for
david
sechard
other
transactions
followed
the
cointets
seeing
no
small
aptitude
in
cerizet
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
pity
that
he
should
be
in
a
position
so
little
favorable
to
his
interests
you
might
be
foreman
some
day
in
a
big
printing
office
making
six
francs
a
day
said
one
of
the
cointets
one
day
and
with
your
intelligence
you
might
come
to
have
a
share
in
the
where
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
good
foreman
returned
cerizet
i
am
an
orphan
i
shall
be
drawn
for
the
army
next
year
and
if
i
get
a
bad
number
who
is
there
to
pay
some
one
else
to
take
my
place
if
you
make
yourself
useful
said
the
printer
why
should
not
somebody
advance
the
money
it
won
t
be
my
gaffer
in
any
case
said
cerizet
pooh
perhaps
by
that
time
he
will
have
found
out
the
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
way
that
could
not
but
rouse
the
worst
thoughts
in
the
listener
and
cerizet
gave
the
papermaker
and
printer
a
very
searching
look
i
do
not
know
what
he
is
busy
about
he
began
prudently
as
the
master
said
nothing
but
he
is
not
the
kind
of
man
to
look
for
capitals
in
the
lower
case
look
here
my
friend
said
the
printer
taking
up
sheets
of
the
diocesan
and
holding
them
out
to
cerizet
if
you
can
correct
these
for
us
by
you
shall
have
eighteen
francs
for
them
we
are
not
shabby
here
we
put
our
competitor
s
foreman
in
the
way
of
making
money
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
might
let
mme
sechard
go
too
far
to
draw
back
with
her
s
and
ruin
her
very
well
we
give
you
permission
to
tell
her
that
we
are
bringing
out
a
s
of
our
own
and
to
call
her
attention
too
to
the
fact
that
she
will
not
be
the
first
in
the
cerizet
s
motive
for
working
so
slowly
on
the
composition
of
the
almanac
should
be
clear
enough
by
this
time
when
eve
heard
that
the
cointets
meant
to
spoil
her
poor
little
speculation
dread
seized
upon
her
at
first
she
tried
to
see
a
proof
of
attachment
in
cerizet
s
hypocritical
warning
of
competition
but
before
long
she
saw
signs
of
an
curiosity
in
her
sole
compositor
the
curiosity
of
youth
she
tried
to
think
cerizet
she
said
one
morning
you
stand
about
on
the
threshold
and
wait
for
sechard
in
the
passage
to
pry
into
his
private
affairs
when
he
comes
out
into
the
yard
to
melt
down
the
rollers
you
are
there
looking
at
him
instead
of
getting
on
with
the
almanac
these
things
are
not
right
especially
when
you
see
that
i
his
wife
respect
his
secrets
and
take
so
much
trouble
on
myself
to
leave
him
free
to
give
himself
up
to
his
work
if
you
had
not
wasted
time
the
almanac
would
be
finished
by
now
and
kolb
would
be
selling
it
and
the
cointets
could
have
done
us
no
eh
madame
answered
cerizet
here
am
i
doing
five
francs
worth
of
composing
for
two
francs
a
day
and
don
t
you
think
that
that
is
enough
why
if
i
did
not
read
proofs
of
an
evening
for
the
cointets
i
might
feed
myself
on
you
are
turning
ungrateful
early
said
eve
deeply
hurt
not
so
much
by
cerizet
s
grumbling
as
by
his
coarse
tone
threatening
attitude
and
aggressive
stare
you
will
get
on
in
not
with
a
woman
to
order
me
about
though
for
it
is
not
often
that
the
month
has
thirty
days
in
it
feeling
wounded
in
her
womanly
dignity
eve
gave
cerizet
a
withering
look
and
went
upstairs
again
at
she
spoke
to
david
are
you
sure
dear
of
that
little
rogue
cerizet
cerizet
said
david
why
he
was
my
youngster
i
trained
him
i
took
him
on
as
my
i
put
him
to
composing
anything
that
he
is
he
owes
to
me
in
fact
you
might
as
well
ask
a
father
if
he
is
sure
of
his
upon
this
eve
told
her
husband
that
cerizet
was
reading
proofs
for
the
cointets
poor
fellow
he
must
live
said
david
humbled
by
the
consciousness
that
he
had
not
done
his
duty
as
a
master
yes
but
there
is
a
difference
dear
between
kolb
and
cerizet
kolb
tramps
about
twenty
leagues
every
day
spends
fifteen
or
twenty
sous
and
brings
us
back
seven
and
eight
and
sometimes
nine
francs
of
sales
and
when
his
expenses
are
paid
he
never
asks
for
more
than
his
wages
kolb
would
sooner
cut
off
his
hand
than
work
a
lever
for
the
cointets
kolb
would
not
peer
among
the
things
that
you
throw
out
into
the
yard
if
people
offered
him
a
thousand
crowns
to
do
it
but
cerizet
picks
them
up
and
looks
at
it
is
hard
for
noble
natures
to
think
evil
to
believe
in
ingratitude
only
through
rough
experience
do
they
learn
the
extent
of
human
corruption
and
even
when
there
is
nothing
left
them
to
learn
in
this
kind
they
rise
to
an
indulgence
which
is
the
last
degree
of
contempt
pooh
pure
paris
s
curiosity
cried
david
very
well
dear
do
me
the
pleasure
to
step
downstairs
and
look
at
the
work
done
by
this
boy
of
yours
and
tell
me
then
whether
he
ought
not
to
have
finished
our
almanac
this
david
went
into
the
workshop
after
dinner
and
saw
that
the
calendar
should
have
been
set
up
in
a
week
then
when
he
heard
that
the
cointets
were
bringing
out
a
similar
almanac
he
came
to
the
rescue
he
took
command
of
the
printing
office
kolb
helped
at
home
instead
of
selling
broadsheets
kolb
and
marion
pulled
off
the
impressions
from
one
form
while
david
worked
another
press
with
cerizet
and
superintended
the
printing
in
various
inks
every
sheet
must
be
printed
four
separate
times
for
which
reason
none
but
small
houses
will
attempt
to
produce
a
s
and
that
only
in
the
country
where
labor
is
cheap
and
the
amount
of
capital
employed
in
the
business
is
so
small
that
the
interest
amounts
to
little
wherefore
a
press
which
turns
out
beautiful
work
can
not
compete
in
the
printing
of
such
sheets
coarse
though
they
may
be
so
for
the
first
time
since
old
sechard
retired
two
presses
were
at
work
in
the
old
house
the
calendar
was
in
its
way
a
masterpiece
but
eve
was
obliged
to
sell
it
for
less
than
a
halfpenny
for
the
cointets
were
supplying
hawkers
at
the
rate
of
three
centimes
per
copy
eve
made
no
loss
on
the
copies
sold
to
hawkers
on
kolb
s
sales
made
directly
she
gained
but
her
little
speculation
was
spoiled
cerizet
saw
that
his
fair
employer
distrusted
him
in
his
own
conscience
he
posed
as
the
accuser
and
said
to
himself
you
suspect
me
do
you
i
will
have
my
revenge
for
the
paris
is
made
on
this
wise
cerizet
accordingly
took
pay
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
work
of
done
for
the
cointets
going
to
their
office
every
evening
for
the
sheets
and
returning
them
in
the
morning
he
came
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
them
through
the
daily
chat
and
at
length
saw
a
chance
of
escaping
the
military
service
a
bait
held
out
to
him
by
the
brothers
so
far
from
requiring
prompting
from
the
cointets
he
was
the
first
to
propose
the
espionage
and
exploitation
of
david
s
researches
eve
saw
how
little
she
could
depend
upon
cerizet
and
to
find
another
kolb
was
simply
impossible
she
made
up
her
mind
to
dismiss
her
one
compositor
for
the
insight
of
a
woman
who
loves
told
her
that
cerizet
was
a
traitor
but
as
this
meant
a
deathblow
to
the
business
she
took
a
man
s
resolution
she
wrote
to
metivier
with
whom
david
and
the
cointets
and
almost
every
papermaker
in
the
department
had
business
relations
and
asked
him
to
put
the
following
advertisement
into
a
trade
paper
for
sale
as
a
going
concern
a
printing
office
with
license
and
plant
situated
at
angouleme
apply
for
particulars
to
metivier
rue
the
cointets
saw
the
advertisement
that
little
woman
has
a
head
on
her
shoulders
they
said
it
is
time
that
we
took
her
business
under
our
own
control
by
giving
her
enough
work
to
live
upon
we
might
find
a
real
competitor
in
david
s
successor
it
is
in
our
interest
to
keep
an
eye
upon
that
the
cointets
went
to
speak
to
david
sechard
moved
thereto
by
this
thought
eve
saw
them
knew
that
her
stratagem
had
succeeded
at
once
and
felt
a
thrill
of
the
keenest
joy
they
stated
their
proposal
they
had
more
work
than
they
could
undertake
their
presses
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
work
would
sechard
print
for
them
they
had
sent
to
bordeaux
for
workmen
and
could
find
enough
to
give
full
employment
to
david
s
three
presses
gentlemen
said
eve
while
cerizet
went
across
to
david
s
workshop
to
announce
the
two
printers
while
my
husband
was
with
the
mm
didot
he
came
to
know
of
excellent
workers
honest
and
industrious
men
he
will
choose
his
successor
no
doubt
from
among
the
best
of
them
if
he
sold
his
business
outright
for
some
twenty
thousand
francs
it
might
bring
us
in
a
thousand
francs
per
annum
that
would
be
better
than
losing
a
thousand
yearly
over
such
trade
as
you
leave
us
why
did
you
envy
us
the
poor
little
almanac
speculation
especially
as
we
have
always
brought
it
out
oh
why
did
you
not
give
us
notice
madame
we
would
not
have
interfered
with
you
one
of
the
brothers
answered
blandly
he
was
known
as
the
tall
cointet
oh
come
gentlemen
you
only
began
your
almanac
after
cerizet
told
you
that
i
was
bringing
out
she
spoke
briskly
looking
full
at
the
tall
cointet
as
she
spoke
he
lowered
his
eyes
cerizet
s
treachery
was
proven
to
her
this
brother
managed
the
business
and
the
he
was
by
far
the
cleverer
man
of
business
of
the
two
jean
showed
no
small
ability
in
the
conduct
of
the
printing
establishment
but
in
intellectual
capacity
he
might
be
said
to
take
colonel
s
rank
while
boniface
was
a
general
jean
left
the
command
to
boniface
this
latter
was
thin
and
spare
in
person
his
face
sallow
as
an
altar
candle
was
mottled
with
reddish
patches
his
lips
were
pinched
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
that
reminded
you
of
a
cat
s
eyes
boniface
cointet
never
excited
himself
he
would
listen
to
the
grossest
insults
with
the
serenity
of
a
bigot
and
reply
in
a
smooth
voice
he
went
to
mass
he
went
to
confession
he
took
the
sacrament
beneath
his
caressing
manners
beneath
an
almost
spiritless
look
lurked
the
tenacity
and
ambition
of
the
priest
and
the
greed
of
the
man
of
business
consumed
with
a
thirst
for
riches
and
honors
in
the
year
tall
cointet
wanted
all
that
the
finally
obtained
by
the
revolution
of
in
his
heart
he
hated
the
aristocrats
and
in
religion
he
was
indifferent
he
was
as
much
or
as
little
of
a
bigot
as
bonaparte
was
a
member
of
the
mountain
yet
his
vertebral
column
bent
with
a
flexibility
wonderful
to
behold
before
the
noblesse
and
the
official
hierarchy
for
the
powers
that
be
he
humbled
himself
he
was
meek
and
obsequious
one
final
characteristic
will
describe
him
for
those
who
are
accustomed
to
dealings
with
all
kinds
of
men
and
can
appreciate
its
value
cointet
concealed
the
expression
of
his
eyes
by
wearing
colored
glasses
ostensibly
to
preserve
his
sight
from
the
reflection
of
the
sunlight
on
the
white
buildings
in
the
streets
for
angouleme
being
set
upon
a
hill
is
exposed
to
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
tall
cointet
was
really
scarcely
above
middle
height
he
looked
much
taller
than
he
actually
was
by
reason
of
the
thinness
which
told
of
overwork
and
a
brain
in
continual
ferment
his
lank
sleek
gray
hair
cut
in
somewhat
ecclesiastical
fashion
the
black
trousers
black
stockings
black
waistcoat
and
long
greatcoat
styled
a
in
the
south
all
completed
his
resemblance
to
a
jesuit
boniface
was
called
tall
cointet
to
distinguish
him
from
his
brother
fat
cointet
and
the
nicknames
expressed
a
difference
in
character
as
well
as
a
physical
difference
between
a
pair
of
equally
redoubtable
personages
as
for
jean
cointet
a
jolly
stout
fellow
with
a
face
from
a
flemish
interior
colored
by
the
southern
sun
of
angouleme
short
and
paunchy
as
sancho
panza
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
pair
of
sturdy
shoulders
he
was
a
striking
contrast
to
his
older
brother
nor
was
the
difference
only
physical
and
intellectual
jean
might
almost
be
called
liberal
in
politics
he
belonged
to
the
left
centre
only
went
to
mass
on
sundays
and
lived
on
a
remarkably
good
understanding
with
the
liberal
men
of
business
there
were
those
in
l
houmeau
who
said
that
this
divergence
between
the
brothers
was
more
apparent
than
real
tall
cointet
turned
his
brother
s
seeming
good
nature
to
advantage
very
skilfully
jean
was
his
bludgeon
it
was
jean
who
gave
all
the
hard
words
it
was
jean
who
conducted
the
executions
which
little
beseemed
the
elder
brother
s
benevolence
jean
took
the
storms
department
he
would
fly
into
a
rage
and
propose
terms
that
nobody
would
think
of
accepting
to
pave
the
way
for
his
brother
s
less
unreasonable
propositions
and
by
such
policy
the
pair
attained
their
ends
sooner
or
later
eve
with
a
woman
s
tact
had
soon
divined
the
characters
of
the
two
brothers
she
was
on
her
guard
with
foes
so
formidable
david
informed
beforehand
of
everything
by
his
wife
lent
a
profoundly
inattentive
mind
to
his
enemies
proposals
come
to
an
understanding
with
my
wife
he
said
as
he
left
the
cointets
in
the
office
and
went
back
to
his
laboratory
mme
sechard
knows
more
about
the
business
than
i
do
myself
i
am
interested
in
something
that
will
pay
better
than
this
poor
place
i
hope
to
find
a
way
to
retrieve
the
losses
that
i
have
made
through
you
and
how
asked
the
fat
cointet
chuckling
eve
gave
her
husband
a
look
that
meant
be
careful
you
will
be
my
tributaries
said
david
and
all
other
consumers
of
papers
then
what
are
you
investigating
asked
the
hypocritical
boniface
cointet
boniface
s
question
slipped
out
smoothly
and
insinuatingly
and
again
eve
s
eyes
implored
her
husband
to
give
an
answer
that
was
no
answer
or
to
say
nothing
at
all
i
am
trying
to
produce
paper
at
fifty
per
cent
less
than
the
present
cost
price
and
he
went
he
did
not
see
the
glances
exchanged
between
the
brothers
that
is
an
inventor
a
man
of
his
build
can
not
sit
with
his
hands
before
let
us
exploit
him
said
boniface
s
eyes
how
can
we
do
it
said
jean
s
mme
sechard
spoke
david
treats
me
just
in
the
same
way
she
said
if
i
show
any
curiosity
he
feels
suspicious
of
my
name
no
doubt
and
out
comes
that
remark
of
his
it
is
only
a
formula
after
if
your
husband
can
work
out
the
formula
he
will
certainly
make
a
fortune
more
quickly
than
by
printing
i
am
not
surprised
that
he
leaves
the
business
to
itself
said
boniface
looking
across
the
empty
workshop
where
kolb
seated
upon
a
was
rubbing
his
bread
with
a
clove
of
garlic
but
it
would
not
suit
our
views
to
see
this
place
in
the
hands
of
an
energetic
pushing
ambitious
competitor
he
continued
and
perhaps
it
might
be
possible
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
suppose
for
instance
that
you
consented
for
a
consideration
to
allow
us
to
put
in
one
of
our
own
men
to
work
your
presses
for
our
benefit
but
nominally
for
you
the
thing
is
sometimes
done
in
paris
we
would
find
the
fellow
work
enough
to
enable
him
to
rent
your
place
and
pay
you
well
and
yet
make
a
profit
for
it
depends
on
the
amount
said
eve
sechard
what
is
your
offer
she
added
looking
at
boniface
to
let
him
see
that
she
understood
his
scheme
perfectly
well
what
is
your
own
idea
jean
cointet
put
in
briskly
three
thousand
francs
for
six
months
said
she
why
my
dear
young
lady
you
were
proposing
to
sell
the
place
outright
for
twenty
thousand
francs
said
boniface
with
much
suavity
the
interest
on
twenty
thousand
francs
is
only
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum
at
six
per
for
a
moment
eve
was
thrown
into
confusion
she
saw
the
need
for
discretion
in
matters
of
business
you
wish
to
use
our
presses
and
our
name
as
well
she
said
and
as
i
have
already
shown
you
i
can
still
do
a
little
business
and
then
we
pay
rent
to
sechard
senior
who
does
not
load
us
with
after
two
hours
of
debate
eve
obtained
two
thousand
francs
for
six
months
one
thousand
to
be
paid
in
advance
when
everything
was
concluded
the
brothers
informed
her
that
they
meant
to
put
in
cerizet
as
lessee
of
the
premises
in
spite
of
herself
eve
started
with
surprise
isn
t
it
better
to
have
somebody
who
knows
the
workshop
asked
the
fat
cointet
eve
made
no
reply
she
took
leave
of
the
brothers
vowing
inwardly
to
look
after
cerizet
well
here
are
our
enemies
in
the
place
laughed
david
when
eve
brought
out
the
papers
for
his
signature
at
pshaw
said
she
i
will
answer
for
kolb
and
marion
they
alone
would
look
after
things
besides
we
shall
be
making
an
income
of
four
thousand
francs
from
the
workshop
which
only
costs
us
money
as
it
is
and
looking
forward
i
see
a
year
in
which
you
may
realize
your
you
were
born
to
be
the
wife
of
a
scientific
worker
as
you
said
by
the
weir
said
david
grasping
her
hand
tenderly
but
though
the
sechard
household
had
money
sufficient
that
winter
they
were
none
the
less
subjected
to
cerizet
s
espionage
and
all
unconsciously
became
dependent
upon
boniface
cointet
we
have
them
now
the
manager
of
the
had
exclaimed
as
he
left
the
house
with
his
brother
the
printer
they
will
begin
to
regard
the
rent
as
regular
income
they
will
count
upon
it
and
run
themselves
into
debt
in
six
months
time
we
will
decline
to
renew
the
agreement
and
then
we
shall
see
what
this
man
of
genius
has
at
the
bottom
of
his
mind
we
will
offer
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
by
taking
him
into
partnership
and
exploiting
his
any
shrewd
man
of
business
who
should
have
seen
tall
cointet
s
face
as
he
uttered
those
words
taking
him
into
partnership
would
have
known
that
it
behooves
a
man
to
be
even
more
careful
in
the
selection
of
the
partner
whom
he
takes
before
the
tribunal
of
commerce
than
in
the
choice
of
the
wife
whom
he
weds
at
the
mayor
s
office
was
it
not
enough
already
and
more
than
enough
that
the
ruthless
hunters
were
on
the
track
of
the
quarry
how
should
david
and
his
wife
with
kolb
and
marion
to
help
them
escape
the
toils
of
a
boniface
cointet
a
draft
for
five
hundred
francs
came
from
lucien
and
this
with
cerizet
s
second
payment
enabled
them
to
meet
all
the
expenses
of
mme
sechard
s
confinement
eve
and
the
mother
and
david
had
thought
that
lucien
had
forgotten
them
and
rejoiced
over
this
token
of
remembrance
as
they
rejoiced
over
his
success
for
his
first
exploits
in
journalism
made
even
more
noise
in
angouleme
than
in
paris
but
david
thus
lulled
into
a
false
security
was
to
receive
a
staggering
blow
a
cruel
letter
from
lucien
to
my
dear
david
i
have
drawn
three
bills
on
you
and
negotiated
them
with
metivier
they
fall
due
in
one
two
and
three
months
time
i
took
this
hateful
course
which
i
know
will
burden
you
heavily
because
the
one
alternative
was
suicide
i
will
explain
my
necessity
some
time
and
i
will
try
besides
to
send
the
amounts
as
the
bills
fall
due
burn
this
letter
say
nothing
to
my
mother
and
sister
for
i
confess
it
i
have
counted
upon
you
upon
the
heroism
known
so
well
to
your
despairing
brother
lucien
de
by
this
time
eve
had
recovered
from
her
confinement
your
brother
poor
fellow
is
in
desperate
straits
david
told
her
i
have
sent
him
three
bills
for
a
thousand
francs
at
one
two
and
three
months
just
make
a
note
of
them
and
he
went
out
into
the
fields
to
escape
his
wife
s
questionings
but
eve
had
felt
very
uneasy
already
it
was
six
months
since
lucien
had
written
to
them
she
talked
over
the
news
with
her
mother
till
her
forebodings
grew
so
dark
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
dissipate
them
she
would
take
a
bold
step
in
her
despair
young
de
rastignac
had
come
to
spend
a
few
days
with
his
family
he
had
spoken
of
lucien
in
terms
that
set
paris
gossip
circulating
in
angouleme
till
at
last
it
reached
the
journalist
s
mother
and
sister
eve
went
to
mme
de
rastignac
asked
the
favor
of
an
interview
with
her
son
spoke
of
all
her
fears
and
asked
him
for
the
truth
in
a
moment
eve
heard
of
her
brother
s
connection
with
the
actress
coralie
of
his
duel
with
michel
chrestien
arising
out
of
his
own
treacherous
behavior
to
daniel
d
arthez
she
received
in
short
a
version
of
lucien
s
history
colored
by
the
personal
feeling
of
a
clever
and
envious
dandy
rastignac
expressed
sincere
admiration
for
the
abilities
so
terribly
compromised
and
a
patriotic
fear
for
the
future
of
a
native
genius
spite
and
jealousy
masqueraded
as
pity
and
friendliness
he
spoke
of
lucien
s
blunders
it
seemed
that
lucien
had
forfeited
the
favor
of
a
very
great
person
and
that
a
patent
conferring
the
right
to
bear
the
name
and
arms
of
rubempre
had
actually
been
made
out
and
subsequently
torn
up
if
your
brother
madame
had
been
well
advised
he
would
have
been
on
the
way
to
honors
and
mme
de
bargeton
s
husband
by
this
time
but
what
can
you
expect
he
deserted
her
and
insulted
her
she
is
now
mme
la
comtesse
sixte
du
chatelet
to
her
own
great
regret
for
she
loved
is
it
possible
exclaimed
mme
sechard
your
brother
is
like
a
young
eagle
blinded
by
the
first
rays
of
glory
and
luxury
when
an
eagle
falls
who
can
tell
how
far
he
may
sink
before
he
drops
to
the
bottom
of
some
precipice
the
fall
of
a
great
man
is
always
proportionately
eve
came
away
with
a
great
dread
in
her
heart
those
last
words
pierced
her
like
an
arrow
she
had
been
wounded
to
the
quick
she
said
not
a
word
to
anybody
but
again
and
again
a
tear
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
fell
upon
the
child
at
her
breast
so
hard
is
it
to
give
up
illusions
sanctioned
by
family
feeling
illusions
that
have
grown
with
our
growth
that
eve
had
doubted
eugene
de
rastignac
she
would
rather
hear
a
true
friend
s
account
of
her
brother
lucien
had
given
them
d
arthez
s
address
in
the
days
when
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
brotherhood
she
wrote
a
pathetic
letter
to
d
arthez
and
received
the
following
reply
arthez
to
mme
madame
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
the
life
that
your
brother
is
leading
in
paris
you
are
anxious
for
enlightenment
as
to
his
prospects
and
to
encourage
a
frank
answer
on
my
part
you
repeat
certain
things
that
de
rastignac
has
told
you
asking
me
if
they
are
true
with
regard
to
the
purely
personal
matter
madame
de
rastignac
s
confidences
must
be
corrected
in
lucien
s
favor
your
brother
wrote
a
criticism
of
my
book
and
brought
it
to
me
in
remorse
telling
me
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
publish
it
although
obedience
to
the
orders
of
his
party
might
endanger
one
who
was
very
dear
to
him
alas
madame
a
man
of
letters
must
needs
comprehend
all
passions
since
it
is
his
pride
to
express
them
i
understood
that
where
a
mistress
and
a
friend
are
involved
the
friend
is
inevitably
sacrificed
i
smoothed
your
brother
s
way
i
corrected
his
murderous
article
myself
and
gave
it
my
full
approval
you
ask
whether
lucien
has
kept
my
friendship
and
esteem
to
this
it
is
difficult
to
make
an
answer
your
brother
is
on
a
road
that
leads
him
to
ruin
at
this
moment
i
still
feel
sorry
for
him
before
long
i
shall
have
forgotten
him
of
set
purpose
not
so
much
on
account
of
what
he
has
done
already
as
for
that
which
he
inevitably
will
do
your
lucien
is
not
a
poet
he
has
the
poetic
temper
he
dreams
he
does
not
think
he
spends
himself
in
emotion
he
does
not
create
he
is
in
fact
permit
me
to
say
it
a
womanish
creature
that
loves
to
shine
the
frenchman
s
great
failing
lucien
will
always
sacrifice
his
best
friend
for
the
pleasure
of
displaying
his
own
wit
he
would
not
hesitate
to
sign
a
pact
with
the
devil
if
so
he
might
secure
a
few
years
of
luxurious
and
glorious
life
nay
has
he
not
done
worse
already
he
has
bartered
his
future
for
the
delights
of
living
openly
with
an
actress
so
far
he
has
not
seen
the
dangers
of
his
position
the
girl
s
youth
and
beauty
and
devotion
for
she
worships
him
have
closed
his
eyes
to
the
truth
he
can
not
see
that
no
glory
or
success
or
fortune
can
induce
the
world
to
accept
the
position
very
well
as
it
is
now
so
it
will
be
with
each
new
temptation
your
brother
will
not
look
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
do
not
be
alarmed
lucien
will
never
go
so
far
as
a
crime
he
has
not
the
strength
of
character
but
he
would
take
the
fruits
of
a
crime
he
would
share
the
benefit
but
not
the
risk
a
thing
that
seems
abhorrent
to
the
whole
world
even
to
scoundrels
oh
he
would
despise
himself
he
would
repent
but
bring
him
once
more
to
the
test
and
he
would
fail
again
for
he
is
weak
of
will
he
can
not
resist
the
allurements
of
pleasure
nor
forego
the
least
of
his
ambitions
he
is
indolent
like
all
who
would
fain
be
poets
he
thinks
it
clever
to
juggle
with
the
difficulties
of
life
instead
of
facing
and
overcoming
them
he
will
be
brave
at
one
time
cowardly
at
another
and
deserves
neither
credit
for
his
courage
nor
blame
for
his
cowardice
lucien
is
like
a
harp
with
strings
that
are
slackened
or
tightened
by
the
atmosphere
he
might
write
a
great
book
in
a
glad
or
angry
mood
and
care
nothing
for
the
success
that
he
had
desired
for
so
long
when
he
first
came
to
paris
he
fell
under
the
influence
of
an
unprincipled
young
fellow
and
was
dazzled
by
his
companion
s
adroitness
and
experience
in
the
difficulties
of
a
literary
life
this
juggler
completely
bewitched
lucien
he
dragged
him
into
a
life
which
a
man
can
not
lead
and
respect
himself
and
unluckily
for
lucien
love
shed
its
magic
over
the
path
the
admiration
that
is
given
too
readily
is
a
sign
of
want
of
judgment
a
poet
ought
not
to
be
paid
in
the
same
coin
as
a
dancer
on
the
we
all
felt
hurt
when
intrigue
and
literary
rascality
were
preferred
to
the
courage
and
honor
of
those
who
counseled
lucien
rather
to
face
the
battle
than
to
filch
success
to
spring
down
into
the
arena
rather
than
become
a
trumpet
in
the
orchestra
society
madame
oddly
enough
shows
plentiful
indulgence
to
young
men
of
lucien
s
stamp
they
are
popular
the
world
is
fascinated
by
their
external
gifts
and
good
looks
nothing
is
asked
of
them
all
their
sins
are
forgiven
they
are
treated
like
perfect
natures
others
are
blind
to
their
defects
they
are
the
world
s
spoiled
children
and
on
the
other
hand
the
world
is
stern
beyond
measure
to
strong
and
complete
natures
perhaps
in
this
apparently
flagrant
injustice
society
acts
sublimely
taking
a
harlequin
at
his
just
worth
asking
nothing
of
him
but
amusement
promptly
forgetting
him
and
asking
divine
great
deeds
of
those
before
whom
she
bends
the
knee
everything
is
judged
by
laws
of
its
being
the
diamond
must
be
flawless
the
ephemeral
creation
of
fashion
may
be
flimsy
bizarre
inconsequent
so
lucien
may
perhaps
succeed
to
admiration
in
spite
of
his
mistakes
he
has
only
to
profit
by
some
happy
vein
or
to
be
among
good
companions
but
if
an
evil
angel
crosses
his
path
he
will
go
to
the
very
depths
of
hell
tis
a
brilliant
assemblage
of
good
qualities
embroidered
upon
too
slight
a
tissue
time
wears
the
flowers
away
till
nothing
but
the
web
is
left
and
if
that
is
poor
stuff
you
behold
a
rag
at
the
last
so
long
as
lucien
is
young
people
will
like
him
but
where
will
he
be
as
a
man
of
thirty
that
is
the
question
which
those
who
love
him
sincerely
are
bound
to
ask
themselves
if
i
alone
had
come
to
think
in
this
way
of
lucien
i
might
perhaps
have
spared
you
the
pain
which
my
plain
speaking
will
give
you
but
to
evade
the
questions
put
by
your
anxiety
and
to
answer
a
cry
of
anguish
like
your
letter
with
commonplaces
seemed
to
me
alike
unworthy
of
you
and
of
me
whom
you
esteem
too
highly
and
besides
those
of
my
friends
who
knew
lucien
are
unanimous
in
their
judgment
so
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
duty
to
put
the
truth
before
you
terrible
though
it
may
be
anything
may
be
expected
of
lucien
anything
good
or
evil
that
is
our
opinion
and
this
letter
is
summed
up
in
that
sentence
if
the
vicissitudes
of
his
present
way
of
life
a
very
wretched
and
slippery
one
should
bring
the
poet
back
to
you
use
all
your
influence
to
keep
him
among
you
for
until
his
character
has
acquired
stability
paris
will
not
be
safe
for
him
he
used
to
speak
of
you
you
and
your
husband
as
his
guardian
angels
he
has
forgotten
you
no
doubt
but
he
will
remember
you
again
when
tossed
by
tempest
with
no
refuge
left
to
him
but
his
home
keep
your
heart
for
him
madame
he
will
need
it
permit
me
madame
to
convey
to
you
the
expression
of
the
sincere
respect
of
a
man
to
whom
your
rare
qualities
are
known
a
man
who
honors
your
mother
s
fears
so
much
that
he
desires
to
style
himself
your
devoted
servant
d
two
days
after
the
letter
came
eve
was
obliged
to
find
a
her
milk
had
dried
up
she
had
made
a
god
of
her
brother
now
in
her
eyes
he
was
depraved
through
the
exercise
of
his
noblest
faculties
he
was
wallowing
in
the
mire
she
noble
creature
that
she
was
was
incapable
of
swerving
from
honesty
and
scrupulous
delicacy
from
all
the
pious
traditions
of
the
hearth
which
still
burns
so
clearly
and
sheds
its
light
abroad
in
quiet
country
homes
then
david
had
been
right
in
his
forecasts
the
leaden
hues
of
grief
overspread
eve
s
white
brow
she
told
her
husband
her
secret
in
one
of
the
pellucid
talks
in
which
married
lovers
tell
everything
to
each
other
the
tones
of
david
s
voice
brought
comfort
though
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
when
he
knew
that
grief
had
dried
his
wife
s
fair
breast
and
knew
eve
s
despair
that
she
could
not
fulfil
a
mother
s
duties
he
held
out
reassuring
hopes
your
brother
s
imagination
has
let
him
astray
you
see
child
it
is
so
natural
that
a
poet
should
wish
for
blue
and
purple
robes
and
hurry
as
eagerly
after
festivals
as
he
does
it
is
a
bird
that
loves
glitter
and
luxury
with
such
simple
sincerity
that
god
forgives
him
if
man
condemns
him
for
but
he
is
draining
our
lives
exclaimed
poor
eve
he
is
draining
our
lives
just
now
but
only
a
few
months
ago
he
saved
us
by
sending
us
the
first
fruits
of
his
earnings
said
the
good
david
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
his
wife
was
in
despair
was
going
beyond
the
limit
and
that
love
for
lucien
would
very
soon
come
back
fifty
years
ago
or
thereabouts
mercier
said
in
his
de
that
a
man
can
not
live
by
literature
poetry
letters
or
science
by
the
creatures
of
his
brain
in
short
and
lucien
poet
that
he
is
would
not
believe
the
experience
of
five
centuries
the
harvests
that
are
watered
with
ink
are
only
reaped
ten
or
twelve
years
after
the
sowing
if
indeed
there
is
any
harvest
after
all
lucien
has
taken
the
green
wheat
for
the
sheaves
he
will
have
learned
something
of
life
at
any
rate
he
was
the
dupe
of
a
woman
at
the
outset
he
was
sure
to
be
duped
afterwards
by
the
world
and
false
friends
he
has
bought
his
experience
dear
that
is
all
our
ancestors
used
to
say
if
the
son
of
the
house
brings
back
his
two
ears
and
his
honor
safe
all
is
well
honor
poor
eve
broke
in
oh
but
lucien
has
fallen
in
so
many
ways
writing
against
his
conscience
attacking
his
best
friend
living
upon
an
actress
showing
himself
in
public
with
her
bringing
us
to
lie
on
straw
oh
that
is
nothing
cried
david
and
suddenly
stopped
short
the
secret
of
lucien
s
forgery
had
nearly
escaped
him
and
unluckily
his
start
left
a
vague
uneasy
impression
on
eve
what
do
you
mean
by
nothing
she
answered
and
where
shall
we
find
the
money
to
meet
bills
for
three
thousand
francs
we
shall
be
obliged
to
renew
the
lease
with
cerizet
to
begin
with
said
david
the
cointets
have
been
allowing
him
fifteen
per
cent
on
the
work
done
for
them
and
in
that
way
alone
he
has
made
six
hundred
francs
besides
contriving
to
make
five
hundred
francs
by
job
if
the
cointets
know
that
perhaps
they
will
not
renew
the
lease
they
will
be
afraid
of
him
for
cerizet
is
a
dangerous
eh
what
is
that
to
me
cried
david
we
shall
be
rich
in
a
very
little
while
when
lucien
is
rich
dear
angel
he
will
have
nothing
but
good
oh
david
my
dear
my
dear
what
is
this
that
you
have
said
unthinkingly
then
lucien
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
poverty
would
not
have
the
force
of
character
to
resist
evil
and
you
think
just
as
d
arthez
thinks
no
one
is
great
unless
he
has
strength
of
character
and
lucien
is
weak
an
angel
must
not
be
tempted
what
is
that
what
but
a
nature
that
is
noble
only
in
its
own
region
its
own
sphere
its
heaven
i
will
spare
him
the
struggle
lucien
is
not
meant
for
it
look
here
i
am
so
near
the
end
now
that
i
can
talk
to
you
about
the
he
drew
several
sheets
of
white
paper
from
his
pocket
brandished
them
in
triumph
and
laid
them
on
his
wife
s
lap
a
ream
of
this
paper
royal
size
would
cost
five
francs
at
the
most
he
added
while
eve
handled
the
specimens
with
almost
childish
surprise
why
how
did
you
make
these
sample
bits
she
asked
with
an
old
kitchen
sieve
of
marion
and
are
you
not
satisfied
yet
asked
eve
the
problem
does
not
lie
in
the
manufacturing
process
it
is
a
question
of
the
first
cost
of
the
pulp
alas
child
i
am
only
a
late
comer
in
a
difficult
path
as
long
ago
as
mme
masson
tried
to
use
printed
paper
a
second
time
she
succeeded
but
what
a
price
it
cost
the
marquis
of
salisbury
tried
to
use
straw
as
a
material
in
and
the
same
idea
occurred
to
seguin
in
france
in
those
sheets
in
your
hand
are
made
from
the
common
rush
the
but
i
shall
try
nettles
and
thistles
for
if
the
material
is
to
continue
to
be
cheap
one
must
look
for
something
that
will
grow
in
marshes
and
waste
lands
where
nothing
else
can
be
grown
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
preparation
of
the
stems
at
present
my
method
is
not
quite
simple
enough
still
in
spite
of
this
difficulty
i
feel
sure
that
i
can
give
the
french
paper
trade
the
privilege
of
our
literature
papermaking
will
be
for
france
what
coal
and
iron
and
coarse
potter
s
clay
are
for
england
a
monopoly
i
mean
to
be
the
jacquart
of
the
eve
rose
to
her
feet
david
s
had
roused
her
to
enthusiasm
to
admiration
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
while
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
you
give
me
my
reward
as
if
i
had
succeeded
already
he
said
for
all
answer
eve
held
up
her
sweet
face
wet
with
tears
to
his
and
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
the
kiss
was
not
for
the
man
of
genius
she
said
but
for
my
comforter
here
is
a
rising
glory
for
the
glory
that
has
set
and
in
the
midst
of
my
grief
for
the
brother
that
has
fallen
so
low
my
husband
s
greatness
is
revealed
to
yes
you
will
be
great
great
like
the
graindorges
the
rouvets
and
van
robais
and
the
persian
who
discovered
madder
like
all
the
men
you
have
told
me
about
great
men
whom
nobody
remembers
because
their
good
deeds
were
obscure
industrial
what
are
they
doing
just
now
it
was
boniface
cointet
who
spoke
he
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
in
the
place
du
murier
with
cerizet
watching
the
silhouettes
of
the
husband
and
wife
on
the
blinds
he
always
came
at
midnight
for
a
chat
with
cerizet
for
the
latter
played
the
spy
upon
his
former
master
s
every
movement
he
is
showing
her
the
paper
he
made
this
morning
no
doubt
said
cerizet
what
is
it
made
of
asked
the
paper
manufacturer
impossible
to
guess
answered
cerizet
i
made
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
scrambled
up
and
watched
the
gaffer
he
was
boiling
pulp
in
a
copper
pan
all
last
night
there
was
a
heap
of
stuff
in
a
corner
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
it
looked
like
a
heap
of
tow
as
near
as
i
could
make
go
no
farther
said
boniface
cointet
in
unctuous
tones
it
would
not
be
right
mme
sechard
will
offer
to
renew
your
lease
tell
her
that
you
are
thinking
of
setting
up
for
yourself
offer
her
half
the
value
of
the
plant
and
license
and
if
she
takes
the
bid
come
to
me
in
any
case
spin
the
matter
out
have
they
no
money
not
a
sou
said
cerizet
not
a
sou
repeated
tall
i
have
them
now
said
he
to
himself
metivier
paper
manufacturers
wholesale
agent
and
cointet
brothers
printers
and
paper
manufacturers
were
also
bankers
in
all
but
name
this
surreptitious
banking
system
defies
all
the
ingenuity
of
the
inland
revenue
department
every
banker
is
required
to
take
out
a
license
which
in
paris
costs
five
hundred
francs
but
no
hitherto
devised
method
of
controlling
commerce
can
detect
the
delinquents
or
compel
them
to
pay
their
due
to
the
government
and
though
metivier
and
the
cointets
were
outside
brokers
in
the
language
of
the
stock
exchange
none
the
less
among
them
they
could
set
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
moving
every
three
months
in
the
markets
of
paris
bordeaux
and
angouleme
now
it
so
fell
out
that
that
very
evening
cointet
brothers
had
received
lucien
s
forged
bills
in
the
course
of
business
upon
this
debt
tall
cointet
forthwith
erected
a
formidable
engine
pointed
as
will
presently
be
seen
against
the
poor
patient
inventor
by
seven
o
clock
next
morning
boniface
cointet
was
taking
a
walk
by
the
mill
stream
that
turned
the
wheels
in
his
big
factory
the
sound
of
the
water
covered
his
talk
for
he
was
talking
with
a
companion
a
young
man
of
who
had
been
appointed
attorney
to
the
court
of
first
instance
in
angouleme
some
six
weeks
ago
the
young
man
s
name
was
pierre
you
are
a
schoolfellow
of
david
sechard
s
are
you
not
asked
tall
cointet
by
way
of
greeting
to
the
young
attorney
had
lost
no
time
in
answering
the
wealthy
manufacturer
s
summons
yes
sir
said
keeping
step
with
tall
cointet
have
you
renewed
the
acquaintance
we
have
met
once
or
twice
at
most
since
he
came
back
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
in
paris
i
was
buried
away
in
the
office
or
at
the
courts
on
and
on
sundays
and
holidays
i
was
hard
at
work
studying
for
i
had
only
myself
to
look
tall
cointet
nodded
approvingly
when
we
met
again
david
and
i
he
asked
me
what
i
had
done
with
myself
i
told
him
that
after
i
had
finished
my
time
at
poitiers
i
had
risen
to
be
maitre
olivet
s
and
that
some
time
or
other
i
hoped
to
make
a
bid
for
his
berth
i
know
a
good
deal
more
of
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
he
calls
himself
now
he
was
mme
de
bargeton
s
lover
our
great
poet
david
sechard
s
in
then
you
can
go
and
tell
david
of
your
appointment
and
offer
him
your
services
said
tall
cointet
one
can
t
do
that
said
the
young
attorney
he
has
never
had
a
lawsuit
and
he
has
no
attorney
so
one
can
do
that
said
cointet
scanning
the
other
narrowly
from
behind
his
colored
spectacles
a
certain
quantity
of
gall
mingled
with
the
blood
in
pierre
s
veins
his
father
was
a
tailor
in
l
houmeau
and
his
schoolfellows
had
looked
down
upon
him
his
complexion
was
of
the
muddy
and
unwholesome
kind
which
tells
a
tale
of
bad
health
late
hours
and
penury
and
almost
always
of
a
bad
disposition
the
best
description
of
him
may
be
given
in
two
familiar
expressions
he
was
sharp
and
snappish
his
cracked
voice
suited
his
sour
face
meagre
look
and
magpie
eyes
of
no
particular
color
a
magpie
eye
according
to
napoleon
is
a
sure
sign
of
dishonesty
look
at
he
said
to
las
cases
at
saint
helena
alluding
to
a
confidential
servant
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
dismiss
for
malversation
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
been
deceived
in
him
for
so
long
he
has
a
magpie
tall
cointet
surveying
the
weedy
little
lawyer
noted
his
face
pitted
with
smallpox
the
thin
hair
and
the
forehead
bald
already
receding
towards
a
bald
cranium
saw
too
the
confession
of
weakness
in
his
attitude
with
the
hand
on
the
hip
here
is
my
man
said
he
to
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
who
had
drunk
scorn
like
water
was
eaten
up
with
a
strong
desire
to
succeed
in
life
he
had
no
money
but
nevertheless
he
had
the
audacity
to
buy
his
employer
s
connection
for
thirty
thousand
francs
reckoning
upon
a
rich
marriage
to
clear
off
the
debt
and
looking
to
his
employer
after
the
usual
custom
to
find
him
a
wife
for
an
attorney
always
has
an
interest
in
marrying
his
successor
because
he
is
the
sooner
paid
off
but
if
counted
upon
his
employer
he
counted
yet
more
upon
himself
he
had
more
than
average
ability
and
that
of
a
kind
not
often
found
in
the
provinces
and
rancor
was
the
mainspring
of
his
power
a
mighty
hatred
makes
a
mighty
effort
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
country
attorney
and
an
attorney
in
paris
tall
cointet
was
too
clever
not
to
know
this
and
to
turn
the
meaner
passions
that
move
a
pettifogging
lawyer
to
good
account
an
eminent
attorney
in
paris
and
there
are
many
who
may
be
so
qualified
is
bound
to
possess
to
some
extent
the
diplomate
s
qualities
he
had
so
much
business
to
transact
business
in
which
large
interests
are
involved
questions
of
such
wide
interest
are
submitted
to
him
that
he
does
not
look
upon
procedure
as
machinery
for
bringing
money
into
his
pocket
but
as
a
weapon
of
attack
and
defence
a
country
attorney
on
the
other
hand
cultivates
the
science
of
costs
as
it
is
called
in
paris
a
host
of
small
items
that
swell
lawyers
bills
and
require
stamped
paper
these
weighty
matters
of
the
law
completely
fill
the
country
attorney
s
mind
he
has
a
bill
of
costs
always
before
his
eyes
whereas
his
brother
of
paris
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
fees
the
fee
is
a
honorarium
paid
by
a
client
over
and
above
the
bill
of
costs
for
the
more
or
less
skilful
conduct
of
his
case
of
the
bill
of
costs
goes
to
the
treasury
whereas
the
entire
fee
belongs
to
the
attorney
let
us
admit
frankly
that
the
fees
received
are
seldom
as
large
as
the
fees
demanded
and
deserved
by
a
clever
lawyer
wherefore
in
paris
attorneys
doctors
and
barristers
like
courtesans
with
a
lover
take
very
considerable
precautions
against
the
gratitude
of
clients
the
client
before
and
after
the
lawsuit
would
furnish
a
subject
worthy
of
meissonier
there
would
be
brisk
bidding
among
attorneys
for
the
possession
of
two
such
admirable
bits
of
genre
there
is
yet
another
difference
between
the
parisian
and
the
country
attorney
an
attorney
in
paris
very
seldom
appears
in
court
though
he
is
sometimes
called
upon
to
act
as
arbitrator
barristers
at
the
present
day
swarm
in
the
provinces
but
in
the
country
attorney
very
often
united
the
functions
of
solicitor
and
counsel
as
a
result
of
this
double
life
the
attorney
acquired
the
peculiar
intellectual
defects
of
the
barrister
and
retained
the
heavy
responsibilities
of
the
attorney
he
grew
talkative
and
fluent
and
lost
his
lucidity
of
judgment
the
first
necessity
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
if
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
ability
tries
to
do
the
work
of
two
men
he
is
apt
to
find
that
the
two
men
are
mediocrities
the
paris
attorney
never
spends
himself
in
forensic
eloquence
and
as
he
seldom
attempts
to
argue
for
and
against
he
has
some
hope
of
preserving
his
mental
rectitude
it
is
true
that
he
brings
the
balista
of
the
law
to
work
and
looks
for
the
weapons
in
the
armory
of
judicial
contradictions
but
he
keeps
his
own
convictions
as
to
the
case
while
he
does
his
best
to
gain
the
day
in
a
word
a
man
loses
his
head
not
so
much
by
thinking
as
by
uttering
thoughts
the
spoken
word
convinces
the
utterer
but
a
man
can
act
against
his
own
bad
judgment
without
warping
it
and
contrive
to
win
in
a
bad
cause
without
maintaining
that
it
is
a
good
one
like
the
barrister
perhaps
for
this
very
reason
an
old
attorney
is
the
more
likely
of
the
two
to
make
a
good
judge
a
country
attorney
as
we
have
seen
has
plenty
of
excuses
for
his
mediocrity
he
takes
up
the
cause
of
petty
passions
he
undertakes
pettifogging
business
he
lives
by
charging
expenses
he
strains
the
code
of
procedure
and
pleads
in
court
in
a
word
his
weak
points
are
legion
and
if
by
chance
you
come
across
a
remarkable
man
practising
as
a
country
attorney
he
is
indeed
above
the
average
level
i
thought
sir
that
you
sent
for
me
on
your
own
affairs
said
and
a
glance
that
put
an
edge
on
his
words
fell
upon
tall
cointet
s
impenetrable
blue
spectacles
let
us
have
no
beating
about
the
bush
returned
boniface
cointet
listen
to
after
that
beginning
big
with
mysterious
import
cointet
set
himself
down
upon
a
bench
and
beckoned
to
do
likewise
when
du
hautoy
came
to
angouleme
in
on
his
way
to
his
consulship
at
valence
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
mme
de
senonches
then
mlle
zephirine
and
had
a
daughter
by
her
added
cointet
for
the
attorney
s
ear
yes
he
continued
as
gave
a
start
yes
and
mlle
zephirine
s
marriage
with
de
senoches
soon
followed
the
birth
of
the
child
the
girl
was
brought
up
in
my
mother
s
house
she
is
the
mlle
francoise
de
la
haye
in
whom
mme
de
senoches
takes
an
interest
she
is
her
godmother
in
the
usual
style
now
my
mother
farmed
land
belonging
to
old
mme
de
cardanet
mlle
zephirine
s
grandmother
and
as
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
sole
heiress
of
the
cardanets
and
the
senonches
of
the
older
branch
they
made
me
trustee
for
the
little
sum
which
francois
du
hautoy
meant
for
the
girl
s
fortune
i
made
my
own
fortune
with
those
ten
thousand
francs
which
amount
to
thirty
thousand
at
the
present
day
mme
de
senonches
is
sure
to
give
the
wedding
clothes
and
some
plate
and
furniture
to
her
goddaughter
now
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
marrying
the
girl
my
lad
said
cointet
slapping
on
the
knee
and
when
you
marry
francoise
de
la
haye
you
will
have
a
large
number
of
the
aristocracy
of
angouleme
as
your
clients
this
understanding
between
us
under
the
rose
will
open
up
magnificent
prospects
for
you
your
position
will
be
as
much
as
any
one
could
want
in
fact
they
don
t
ask
better
i
what
is
to
be
done
asked
eagerly
you
have
an
attorney
maitre
cachan
and
moreover
i
shall
not
leave
cachan
at
once
for
you
i
shall
only
be
your
client
later
on
said
cointet
significantly
what
is
to
be
done
do
you
ask
my
friend
eh
why
david
sechard
s
business
the
poor
devil
has
three
thousand
francs
worth
of
bills
to
meet
he
will
not
meet
them
you
will
stave
off
legal
proceedings
in
such
a
way
as
to
increase
the
expenses
enormously
don
t
trouble
yourself
go
on
pile
on
items
doublon
my
will
act
under
cachan
s
directions
and
he
will
lay
on
like
a
blacksmith
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
now
young
man
an
eloquent
pause
followed
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
we
have
never
seen
each
other
cointet
resumed
i
have
not
said
a
syllable
to
you
you
know
nothing
about
du
hautoy
nor
mme
de
senonches
nor
mlle
de
la
haye
only
when
the
time
comes
two
months
hence
you
will
propose
for
the
young
lady
if
we
should
want
to
see
each
other
you
will
come
here
after
dark
let
us
have
nothing
in
then
you
mean
to
ruin
sechard
asked
not
exactly
but
he
must
be
in
jail
for
some
time
and
what
is
the
object
do
you
think
that
i
am
noodle
enough
to
tell
you
that
if
you
have
wit
enough
to
find
out
you
will
have
sense
enough
to
hold
your
old
sechard
has
plenty
of
money
said
he
was
beginning
already
to
enter
into
boniface
cointet
s
notions
and
foresaw
a
possible
cause
of
failure
so
long
as
the
father
lives
he
will
not
give
his
son
a
farthing
and
the
old
printer
has
no
mind
as
yet
to
send
in
an
order
for
his
funeral
agreed
said
promptly
making
up
his
mind
i
don
t
ask
you
for
guarantees
i
am
an
attorney
if
any
one
plays
me
a
trick
there
will
be
an
account
to
settle
between
the
rogue
will
go
far
thought
cointet
he
bade
the
day
after
this
conference
was
the
of
april
and
the
cointets
presented
the
first
of
the
three
bills
forged
by
lucien
unluckily
the
bill
was
brought
to
poor
mme
sechard
and
she
seeing
at
once
that
the
signature
was
not
in
her
husband
s
handwriting
sent
for
david
and
asked
him
you
did
not
put
your
name
to
that
bill
did
you
no
said
he
your
brother
was
so
pressed
for
time
that
he
signed
for
eve
returned
the
bill
to
the
bank
messenger
sent
by
the
cointets
we
can
not
meet
it
she
said
then
feeling
that
her
strength
was
failing
she
went
up
to
her
room
david
followed
her
go
quickly
to
the
cointets
dear
eve
said
faintly
they
will
have
some
consideration
for
you
beg
them
to
wait
and
call
their
attention
besides
to
the
fact
that
when
cerizet
s
lease
is
renewed
they
will
owe
you
a
thousand
david
went
forthwith
to
his
enemies
now
any
foreman
may
become
a
master
printer
but
there
are
not
always
the
makings
of
a
good
man
of
business
in
a
skilled
typographer
david
knew
very
little
of
business
when
therefore
with
a
heart
and
a
sensation
of
throttling
david
had
put
his
excuses
badly
enough
and
formulated
his
request
the
answer
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
us
the
bill
has
been
passed
on
to
us
by
metivier
metivier
will
pay
us
apply
to
metivier
cut
him
short
at
once
oh
cried
eve
when
she
heard
the
result
as
soon
as
the
bill
is
returned
to
metivier
we
may
be
at
two
o
clock
the
next
day
doublon
bailiff
made
protest
for
at
two
o
clock
a
time
when
the
place
du
murier
is
full
of
people
so
that
though
doublon
was
careful
to
stand
and
chat
at
the
back
door
with
marion
and
kolb
the
news
of
the
protest
was
known
all
over
the
business
world
of
angouleme
that
evening
tall
cointet
had
enjoined
it
upon
master
doublon
to
show
the
sechards
the
greatest
consideration
but
when
all
was
said
and
done
could
the
bailiff
s
hypocritical
regard
for
appearances
save
eve
and
david
from
the
disgrace
of
a
suspension
of
payment
let
each
judge
for
himself
a
tolerably
long
digression
of
this
kind
will
seem
all
too
short
and
ninety
out
of
every
hundred
readers
shall
seize
with
avidity
upon
details
that
possess
all
the
piquancy
of
novelty
thus
establishing
yet
once
again
the
trust
of
the
axiom
that
there
is
nothing
so
little
known
as
that
which
everybody
is
supposed
to
know
the
law
of
the
land
to
wit
and
of
a
truth
for
the
immense
majority
of
frenchmen
a
minute
description
of
some
part
of
the
machinery
of
banking
will
be
as
interesting
as
any
chapter
of
foreign
travel
when
a
tradesman
living
in
one
town
gives
a
bill
to
another
tradesman
elsewhere
as
david
was
supposed
to
have
done
for
lucien
s
benefit
the
transaction
ceases
to
be
a
simple
promissory
note
given
in
the
way
of
business
by
one
tradesman
to
another
in
the
same
place
and
becomes
in
some
sort
a
letter
of
exchange
when
therefore
metivier
accepted
lucien
s
three
bills
he
was
obliged
to
send
them
for
collection
to
his
correspondents
in
angouleme
to
cointet
brothers
that
is
to
say
hence
likewise
a
certain
initial
loss
for
lucien
in
exchange
on
angouleme
taking
the
practical
shape
of
an
abatement
of
so
much
per
cent
over
and
above
the
discount
in
this
way
sechard
s
bills
had
passed
into
circulation
in
the
bank
you
would
not
believe
how
greatly
the
quality
of
banker
united
with
the
august
title
of
creditor
changes
the
debtor
s
position
for
instance
when
a
bill
has
been
passed
through
the
bank
please
note
that
expression
and
transferred
from
the
money
market
in
paris
to
the
financial
world
of
angouleme
if
that
bill
is
protested
then
the
bankers
in
angouleme
must
draw
up
a
detailed
account
of
the
expenses
of
protest
and
return
tis
a
duty
which
they
owe
to
themselves
joking
apart
no
account
of
the
most
romantic
adventure
could
be
more
mildly
improbable
than
this
of
the
journey
made
by
a
bill
behold
a
certain
article
in
the
code
of
commerce
authorizing
the
most
ingenious
pleasantries
after
mascarille
s
manner
and
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
make
apparent
manifold
atrocities
lurking
beneath
the
formidable
word
master
doublon
registered
the
protest
and
went
himself
with
it
to
mm
cointet
brothers
the
firm
had
a
standing
account
with
their
bailiff
he
gave
them
six
months
credit
and
the
lynxes
of
angouleme
practically
took
a
twelvemonth
though
tall
cointet
would
say

the
lynxes

you
want

quietly
sat
himself
down
at
his
desk
and
took
out
a
small
sheet
of
paper
with
a
centime
stamp
upon
it
chatting
as
he
did
so
with

of

repay
ourselves
by
our
draft
at
sight
upon

rue
serpente

payable
to
order
of
gannerac
of
l
angouleme
may
cointet
brothers
at
the
foot
of
this
little
memorandum
drafted
with
the
ease
that
comes
of
long
practice
for
the
writer
chatted
with
doublon
as
he
wrote
there
appeared
the
subjoined
form
of
declaration
we
the
undersigned
postel
of
l
houmeau
pharmaceutical
chemist
and
gannerac
forwarding
agent
merchant
of
this
town
hereby
certify
that
the
present
rate
of
exchange
on
paris
is
one
and
a
quarter
per
cent
angouleme
may
here
doublon
be
so
good
as
to
step
round
and
ask
postel
and
gannerac
to
put
their
names
to
this
declaration
and
bring
it
back
with
you
and
doublon
quite
accustomed
as
he
was
to
these
instruments
of
torture
forthwith
went
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
evidently
the
protest
might
have
been
sent
in
an
envelope
as
in
paris
and
even
so
all
angouleme
was
sure
to
hear
of
the
poor
sechards
unlucky
predicament
how
they
all
blamed
his
want
of
business
energy
his
excessive
fondness
for
his
wife
had
been
the
ruin
of
him
according
to
some
others
maintained
that
it
was
his
affection
for
his
and
what
shocking
conclusions
did
they
not
draw
from
these
premises
a
man
ought
never
to
embrace
the
interests
of
his
kith
and
kin
old
sechard
s
conduct
met
with
approval
and
people
admired
him
for
his
treatment
of
his
son
and
now
all
you
who
for
any
reason
whatsoever
should
forget
to
honor
your
engagements
look
well
into
the
methods
of
the
banking
business
by
which
one
thousand
francs
may
be
made
to
pay
interest
at
the
rate
of
francs
in
ten
minutes
without
breaking
the
law
of
the
land
the
thousand
francs
the
one
incontestable
item
in
the
account
comes
first
the
second
item
is
shared
between
the
bailiff
and
the
inland
revenue
department
the
six
francs
due
to
the
state
for
providing
a
piece
of
stamped
paper
and
putting
the
debtor
s
mortification
on
record
will
probably
ensure
a
long
life
to
this
abuse
and
as
you
already
know
one
franc
fifty
centimes
from
this
item
found
its
way
into
the
banker
s
pockets
in
the
shape
of
doublon
s
rebate
bank
charges
per
cent
runs
the
third
item
which
appears
upon
the
ingenious
plea
that
if
a
banker
has
not
received
payment
he
has
for
all
practical
purposes
discounted
a
bill
and
although
the
contrary
may
be
the
case
if
you
fail
to
receive
a
thousand
francs
it
seems
to
be
very
much
the
same
thing
as
if
you
had
paid
them
away
everybody
who
has
discounted
a
bill
knows
that
he
has
to
pay
more
than
the
six
per
cent
fixed
by
law
for
a
small
percentage
appears
under
the
humble
title
of
charges
representing
a
premium
on
the
financial
genius
and
skill
with
which
the
capitalist
puts
his
money
out
to
interest
the
more
money
he
makes
out
of
you
the
more
he
asks
wherefore
it
would
be
undoubtedly
cheaper
to
discount
a
bill
with
a
fool
if
fools
there
be
in
the
profession
of
the
law
requires
the
banker
to
obtain
a
s
certificate
for
the
rate
of
exchange
when
a
place
is
so
unlucky
as
to
boast
no
stock
exchange
two
merchants
act
instead
this
is
the
significance
of
the
item
brokerage
it
is
a
fixed
charge
of
a
quarter
per
cent
on
the
amount
of
the
protested
bill
the
custom
is
to
consider
the
amount
as
paid
to
the
merchants
who
act
for
the
and
the
banker
quietly
puts
the
money
into
his
so
much
for
the
third
item
in
this
delightful
account
the
fourth
includes
the
cost
of
the
piece
of
stamped
paper
on
which
the
account
itself
appears
as
well
as
the
cost
of
the
stamp
for
as
it
is
ingeniously
named
the
banker
s
draft
upon
his
colleague
in
paris
the
fifth
is
a
charge
for
postage
and
the
legal
interest
due
upon
the
amount
for
the
time
that
it
may
happen
to
be
absent
from
the
banker
s
strong
box
the
final
item
the
exchange
is
the
object
for
which
the
bank
exists
which
is
to
say
for
the
transmission
of
sums
of
money
from
one
place
to
another
now
sift
this
account
thoroughly
and
what
do
you
find
the
method
of
calculation
closely
resembles
polichinelle
s
arithmetic
in
lablache
s
neapolitan
song
fifteen
and
five
make
the
signatures
of
messieurs
postel
and
gannerac
were
obviously
given
to
oblige
in
the
way
of
business
the
cointets
would
act
at
need
for
gannerac
as
gannerac
acted
for
the
cointets
it
was
a
practical
application
of
the
proverb
reach
me
the
rhubarb
and
i
will
pass
you
the
cointet
brothers
moreover
kept
a
standing
account
with
metivier
there
was
no
need
of
a
and
no
was
made
a
returned
bill
between
the
two
firms
simply
meant
a
debit
or
credit
entry
and
another
line
in
a
ledger
this
account
therefore
is
reduced
to
the
one
thousand
francs
with
an
additional
thirteen
francs
for
expenses
of
protest
and
half
per
cent
for
a
month
s
delay
one
thousand
and
eighteen
francs
it
may
be
in
all
suppose
that
in
a
large
a
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
is
daily
protested
on
an
average
then
the
banker
receives
francs
a
day
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
constitution
of
the
banking
system
that
all
powerful
invention
due
to
the
jewish
intellect
of
the
middle
ages
which
after
six
centuries
still
controls
monarchs
and
peoples
in
other
words
a
thousand
francs
would
bring
such
a
house
francs
per
day
or
ten
thousand
two
hundred
and
twenty
francs
per
annum
triple
the
average
of
protests
and
consequently
of
expenses
and
you
shall
derive
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
interest
upon
purely
fictitious
capital
for
which
reason
nothing
is
more
lovingly
cultivated
than
these
little
accounts
of
if
david
sechard
had
come
to
pay
his
bill
on
the
of
may
that
is
the
day
after
it
was
protested
mm
cointet
brothers
would
have
met
him
at
once
with
we
have
returned
your
bill
to
metivier
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
document
would
have
been
lying
upon
the
desk
a
banker
has
a
right
to
make
out
the
account
of
expenses
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
the
bill
is
protested
and
he
uses
the
right
to
sweat
the
silver
crowns
in
the
country
banker
s
phrase
the
kellers
with
correspondents
all
over
the
world
make
twenty
thousand
francs
per
annum
by
charges
for
postage
alone
accounts
of
expenses
of
protest
pay
for
mme
la
baronne
de
nucingen
s
dresses
opera
box
and
carriage
the
charge
for
postage
is
a
more
shocking
swindle
because
a
house
will
settle
ten
matters
of
business
in
as
many
lines
of
a
single
letter
and
of
the
tithe
wrung
from
misfortune
the
government
strange
to
say
takes
its
share
and
the
national
revenue
is
swelled
by
a
tax
on
commercial
failure
and
the
bank
from
the
august
height
of
a
she
flings
an
observation
full
of
commonsense
at
the
debtor
how
is
it
asks
she
that
you
can
not
meet
your
bill
and
unluckily
there
is
no
reply
to
the
question
wherefore
the
account
of
expenses
is
an
account
bristling
with
dreadful
fictions
fit
to
cause
any
debtor
who
henceforth
shall
reflect
upon
this
instructive
page
a
salutary
shudder
on
the
of
may
metivier
received
the
account
from
cointet
brothers
with
instructions
to
proceed
against
lucien
chardon
otherwise
de
rubempre
with
the
utmost
rigor
of
the
law
eve
also
wrote
to
metivier
and
a
few
days
later
received
an
answer
which
reassured
her
completely
sechard
junior
printer
i
have
duly
received
your
esteemed
favor
of
the
instant
from
your
explanation
of
the
bill
due
on
april
i
understand
that
you
have
obliged
your
de
rubempre
who
is
spending
so
much
that
it
will
be
doing
you
a
service
to
summons
him
his
present
position
is
such
that
he
is
likely
to
delay
payment
for
long
if
your
should
refuse
payment
i
shall
rely
upon
the
credit
of
your
i
sign
myself
now
as
ever
your
obedient
servant
well
said
eve
commenting
upon
the
letter
to
david
lucien
will
know
when
they
summons
him
that
we
could
not
what
a
change
wrought
in
eve
those
few
words
meant
the
love
that
grew
deeper
as
she
came
to
know
her
husband
s
character
better
and
better
was
taking
the
place
of
love
for
her
brother
in
her
heart
but
to
how
many
illusions
had
she
not
bade
farewell
and
now
let
us
trace
out
the
whole
history
of
the
bill
and
the
account
of
expenses
in
the
business
world
of
paris
the
law
enacts
that
the
third
holder
the
technical
expression
for
the
third
party
into
whose
hands
the
bill
passes
is
at
liberty
to
proceed
for
the
whole
amount
against
any
one
of
the
various
endorsers
who
appears
to
him
to
be
most
likely
to
make
prompt
payment
metivier
using
this
discretion
served
a
summons
upon
lucien
behold
the
successive
stages
of
the
proceedings
all
of
them
perfectly
futile
metivier
with
the
cointets
behind
him
knew
that
lucien
was
not
in
a
position
to
pay
but
insolvency
in
fact
is
not
insolvency
in
law
until
it
has
been
formally
proved
formal
proof
of
lucien
s
inability
to
pay
was
obtained
in
the
following
manner
on
the
of
may
metivier
s
gave
lucien
notice
of
the
protest
and
an
account
of
the
expense
thereof
and
summoned
him
to
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
commerce
or
county
court
of
paris
to
hear
a
vast
number
of
things
this
among
others
that
he
was
liable
to
imprisonment
as
a
merchant
by
the
time
that
lucien
hard
pressed
and
hunted
down
on
all
sides
read
this
jargon
he
received
notice
of
judgment
against
him
by
default
coralie
his
mistress
ignorant
of
the
whole
matter
imagined
that
lucien
had
obliged
his
and
handed
him
all
the
documents
together
too
late
an
actress
sees
so
much
of
bailiffs
duns
and
writs
upon
the
stage
that
she
looks
on
all
stamped
paper
as
a
farce
tears
filled
lucien
s
eyes
he
was
unhappy
on
sechard
s
account
he
was
ashamed
of
the
forgery
he
wished
to
pay
he
desired
to
gain
time
naturally
he
took
counsel
of
his
friends
but
by
the
time
lousteau
blondet
bixiou
and
nathan
had
told
the
poet
to
snap
his
fingers
at
a
court
only
established
for
tradesmen
lucien
was
already
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
he
beheld
upon
his
door
the
little
yellow
placard
which
leaves
its
reflection
on
the
porter
s
countenance
and
exercises
a
most
astringent
influence
upon
credit
striking
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
smallest
tradesman
and
freezing
the
blood
in
the
veins
of
a
poet
susceptible
enough
to
care
about
the
bits
of
wood
silken
rags
dyed
woolen
stuffs
and
multifarious
gimcracks
entitled
furniture
when
the
broker
s
men
came
for
coralie
s
furniture
the
author
of
the
fled
to
a
friend
of
bixiou
s
one
desroches
a
barrister
who
burst
out
laughing
at
the
sight
of
lucien
in
such
a
state
about
nothing
at
all
that
is
nothing
my
dear
fellow
do
you
want
to
gain
time
yes
as
much
very
well
apply
for

and
look
up

is
a
solicitor
in
the
commercial
court
and
a
friend
of
mine
take
your
documents
to
him
he
will
make
a
second
application
for
you
and
give
notice
of
objection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
there
is
not
the
least
difficulty

are

your

is

was

before
desroches
expected
it
lucien

creditor
was
pushing
on

proceedings
against
him
a
second
execution
was
put
in
and
again
coralie

pilasters
were
gilded
with
placards
desroches
felt
rather
foolish
a
colleague
had
caught
him
napping
to
use
his
own
expression
he
demurred
not
without
reason
that
the
furniture
belonged
to
mlle
coralie
with
whom
lucien
was
living
and
demanded
an
order
for
inquiry
thereupon
the
judge
referred
the
matter
to

the
furniture
was
proved
to

very
day
when

served
the
writ
upon

requiring
her
to
pay
a
sum
so
enormous
in
her
eyes
there
came
a
letter
like
a
thunderbolt
from
metivier
monsieur
sechard
junior
printer
sir
your
chardon
is
so
shamelessly
dishonest
that
he
declares
his
furniture
to
be
the
property
of
an
actress
with
whom
he
is
living
you
ought
to
have
informed
me
candidly
of
these
circumstances
and
not
have
allowed
me
to
go
to
useless
expense
over
law
proceedings
i
have
received
no
answer
to
my
letter
of
the
of
may
last
you
must
not
therefore
take
it
amiss
if
i
ask
for
immediate
repayment
of
the
three
bills
and
the
expenses
to
which
i
have
been
yours
eve
had
heard
nothing
during
these
months
and
supposed
in
her
ignorance
of
commercial
law
that
her
brother
had
made
reparation
for
his
sins
by
meeting
the
forged
bills
be
quick
and
go
at
once
to
dear
she
said
tell
him
about
it
and
ask
his
david
hurried
to
his
schoolfellow
s
office
when
you
came
to
tell
me
of
your
appointment
and
offered
me
your
services
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
need
them
so
soon
he
said
studied
the
fine
face
of
this
man
who
sat
opposite
him
in
the
office
chair
and
scarcely
listened
to
the
details
of
the
case
for
he
knew
more
of
them
already
than
the
speaker
as
soon
as
he
saw
sechard
s
anxiety
he
said
to
himself
the
trick
has
this
kind
of
comedy
is
often
played
in
an
attorney
s
office
why
are
the
cointets
persecuting
him
wondered
within
himself
for
the
attorney
can
use
his
wit
to
read
his
clients
thoughts
as
clearly
as
the
ideas
of
their
opponents
and
it
is
his
business
to
see
both
sides
of
the
judicial
web
you
want
to
gain
time
he
said
at
last
when
sechard
had
come
to
an
end
how
long
do
you
want
something
like
three
or
four
months
oh
four
months
that
would
be
my
salvation
exclaimed
david
appeared
to
him
as
an
angel
very
well
no
one
shall
lay
hands
on
any
of
your
furniture
and
no
one
shall
arrest
you
for
four
months
but
it
will
cost
you
a
great
deal
said
eh
what
does
that
matter
to
me
cried
sechard
you
are
expecting
some
money
to
come
in
but
are
you
sure
of
it
asked
astonished
at
the
way
in
which
his
client
walked
into
the
toils
in
three
months
time
i
shall
have
plenty
of
money
said
the
inventor
with
an
inventor
s
hopeful
confidence
your
father
is
still
above
ground
suggested
he
is
in
no
hurry
to
leave
his
do
you
think
that
i
am
counting
on
my
father
s
death
returned
david
i
am
on
the
track
of
a
trade
secret
the
secret
of
making
a
sheet
of
paper
as
strong
as
dutch
paper
without
a
thread
of
cotton
in
it
and
at
a
cost
of
fifty
per
cent
less
than
cotton
there
is
a
fortune
in
that
exclaimed
he
knew
now
what
the
tall
cointet
meant
a
large
fortune
my
friend
for
in
ten
years
time
the
demand
for
paper
will
be
ten
times
larger
than
it
is
journalism
will
be
the
craze
of
our
nobody
knows
your
secret
nobody
except
my
you
have
not
told
any
one
what
you
mean
to
do
the
cointets
for
example
i
did
say
something
about
it
but
in
general
terms
i
a
sudden
spark
of
generosity
flashed
through
s
rancorous
soul
he
tried
to
reconcile
sechard
s
interests
with
the
cointet
s
projects
and
his
own
listen
david
we
are
old
schoolfellows
you
and
i
i
will
fight
your
case
but
understand
this
clearly
the
defence
in
the
teeth
of
the
law
will
cost
you
five
or
six
thousand
francs
do
not
compromise
your
prospects
i
think
you
will
be
compelled
to
share
the
profits
of
your
invention
with
some
one
of
our
paper
manufacturers
let
us
see
now
you
will
think
twice
before
you
buy
or
build
a
paper
mill
and
there
is
the
cost
of
the
patent
besides
all
this
means
time
and
money
too
the
servers
of
writs
will
be
down
upon
you
too
soon
perhaps
although
we
are
going
to
give
them
the
slip
i
have
my
secret
said
david
with
the
simplicity
of
the
man
of
books
well
and
good
your
secret
will
be
your
plank
of
safety
said
his
first
loyal
intention
of
avoiding
a
lawsuit
by
a
compromise
was
frustrated
i
do
not
wish
to
know
it
but
mind
this
that
i
tell
you
work
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
if
you
can
so
that
no
one
may
watch
you
and
gain
a
hint
from
your
ways
of
working
or
your
plank
will
be
stolen
from
under
your
feet
an
inventor
and
a
simpleton
often
live
in
the
same
skin
your
mind
runs
so
much
on
your
secrets
that
you
can
not
think
of
everything
people
will
begin
to
have
their
suspicions
at
last
and
the
place
is
full
of
paper
manufacturers
so
many
manufacturers
so
many
enemies
for
you
you
are
like
a
beaver
with
the
hunters
about
you
do
not
give
them
your
skin
thank
you
dear
fellow
i
have
told
myself
all
this
exclaimed
sechard
but
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
showing
so
much
concern
for
me
and
for
your
forethought
it
does
not
really
matter
to
me
myself
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
would
be
enough
for
me
and
my
father
ought
by
rights
to
leave
me
three
times
as
much
some
day
love
and
thought
make
up
my
life
a
divine
life
i
am
working
for
lucien
s
sake
and
for
my
wife
come
give
me
this
power
of
attorney
and
think
of
nothing
but
your
discovery
if
there
should
be
any
danger
of
arrest
i
will
let
you
know
in
time
for
we
must
think
of
all
possibilities
and
let
me
tell
you
again
to
allow
no
one
of
whom
you
are
not
so
sure
as
you
are
of
yourself
to
come
into
your
cerizet
did
not
care
to
continue
the
lease
of
the
plant
and
premises
hence
our
little
money
difficulties
we
have
no
one
at
home
now
but
marion
and
kolb
an
alsacien
as
trusty
as
a
dog
and
my
wife
and
her
mother
one
word
said
don
t
trust
that
dog
you
do
not
know
him
exclaimed
david
he
is
like
a
second
may
i
try
him
yes
said
sechard
there
but
send
mme
sechard
to
me
i
must
have
a
power
of
attorney
from
your
wife
and
bear
in
mind
my
friend
that
there
is
a
fire
burning
in
your
affairs
said
by
way
of
warning
of
all
the
troubles
gathering
in
the
law
courts
to
burst
upon
david
s
head
here
am
i
with
one
foot
in
burgundy
and
the
other
in
champagne
he
added
to
himself
as
he
closed
the
office
door
on
david
harassed
by
money
difficulties
beset
with
fears
for
his
wife
s
health
stung
to
the
quick
by
lucien
s
disgrace
david
had
worked
on
at
his
problem
he
had
been
trying
to
find
a
single
process
to
replace
the
various
operations
of
pounding
and
maceration
to
which
all
flax
or
cotton
or
rags
any
vegetable
fibre
in
fact
must
be
subjected
and
as
he
went
to
s
office
he
abstractedly
chewed
a
bit
of
nettle
stalk
that
had
been
steeping
in
water
on
his
way
home
tolerably
satisfied
with
his
interview
he
felt
a
little
pellet
sticking
between
his
teeth
he
laid
it
on
his
hand
flattened
it
out
and
saw
that
the
pulp
was
far
superior
to
any
previous
result
the
want
of
cohesion
is
the
great
drawback
of
all
vegetable
fibre
straw
for
instance
yields
a
very
brittle
paper
which
may
almost
be
called
metallic
and
resonant
these
chances
only
befall
bold
inquirers
into
nature
s
methods
now
said
he
to
himself
i
must
contrive
to
do
by
machinery
and
some
chemical
agency
the
thing
that
i
myself
have
done
when
his
wife
saw
him
his
face
was
radiant
with
belief
in
victory
there
were
traces
of
tears
in
eve
s
face
oh
my
darling
do
not
trouble
yourself
will
guarantee
that
we
shall
not
be
molested
for
several
months
to
come
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
expense
over
it
but
as
said
when
he
came
to
the
door
with
me
a
frenchman
has
a
right
to
keep
his
creditors
waiting
provided
he
repays
them
capital
interest
and
very
well
then
we
shall
do
that
and
live
meanwhile
asked
poor
eve
who
thought
of
everything
ah
that
is
true
said
david
carrying
his
hand
to
his
ear
after
the
unaccountable
fashion
of
most
perplexed
mortals
mother
will
look
after
little
lucien
and
i
can
go
back
to
work
again
said
she
eve
oh
my
eve
cried
david
holding
his
wife
closely
to
at
saintes
not
very
far
from
here
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
lived
one
of
the
very
greatest
of
frenchmen
for
he
was
not
merely
the
inventor
of
glaze
he
was
the
glorious
precursor
of
buffon
and
cuvier
besides
he
was
the
first
geologist
good
simple
soul
that
he
was
bernard
palissy
endured
the
martyrdom
appointed
for
all
seekers
into
secrets
but
his
wife
and
children
and
all
his
neighbors
were
against
him
his
wife
used
to
sell
his
tools
nobody
understood
him
he
wandered
about
the
countryside
he
was
hunted
down
they
jeered
at
him
but
i
am
loved
dearly
loved
said
eve
with
the
quiet
serenity
of
the
love
that
is
sure
of
itself
and
so
may
well
endure
all
that
poor
bernard
palissy
suffered
bernard
palissy
the
discoverer
of
ecouen
ware
the
huguenot
excepted
by
charles
ix
on
the
day
of
he
lived
to
be
rich
and
honored
in
his
old
age
and
lectured
on
the
science
of
earths
as
he
called
it
in
the
face
of
so
long
as
my
fingers
can
hold
an
iron
you
shall
want
for
nothing
cried
the
poor
wife
in
tones
that
told
of
the
deepest
devotion
when
i
was
mme
prieur
s
forewoman
i
had
a
friend
among
the
girls
basine
clerget
a
cousin
of
postel
s
a
very
good
child
well
basine
told
me
the
other
day
when
she
brought
back
the
linen
that
she
was
taking
mme
prieur
s
business
i
will
work
for
ah
you
shall
not
work
there
for
long
said
david
i
have
found
out
eve
watching
his
face
saw
the
sublime
belief
in
success
which
sustains
the
inventor
the
belief
that
gives
him
courage
to
go
forth
into
the
virgin
forests
of
the
country
of
discovery
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
answered
that
confident
look
with
a
smile
david
bent
his
head
mournfully
oh
my
dear
i
am
not
laughing
i
did
not
doubt
it
was
not
a
sneer
cried
eve
on
her
knees
before
her
husband
but
i
see
plainly
now
that
you
were
right
to
tell
me
nothing
about
your
experiments
and
your
hopes
ah
yes
dear
an
inventor
should
endure
the
long
painful
travail
of
a
great
idea
alone
he
should
not
utter
a
word
of
it
even
to
his
wife
a
woman
is
a
woman
still
this
eve
of
yours
could
not
help
smiling
when
she
heard
you
say
i
have
found
out
for
the
seventeenth
time
this
david
burst
out
laughing
so
heartily
at
his
own
expense
that
eve
caught
his
hand
in
hers
and
kissed
it
reverently
it
was
a
delicious
moment
for
them
both
one
of
those
roses
of
love
and
tenderness
that
grow
beside
the
desert
paths
of
the
bitterest
poverty
nay
at
times
in
yet
darker
depths
as
the
storm
of
misfortune
grew
eve
s
courage
redoubled
the
greatness
of
her
husband
s
nature
his
inventor
s
simplicity
the
tears
that
now
and
again
she
saw
in
the
eyes
of
this
dreamer
of
dreams
with
the
tender
heart
all
these
things
aroused
in
her
an
unsuspected
energy
of
resistance
once
again
she
tried
the
plan
that
had
succeeded
so
well
already
she
wrote
to
metivier
reminding
him
that
the
printing
office
was
for
sale
offered
to
pay
him
out
of
the
proceeds
and
begged
him
not
to
ruin
david
with
needless
costs
metivier
received
the
heroic
letter
and
shammed
dead
his
replied
that
in
the
absence
of
metivier
he
could
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
stay
proceedings
for
his
employer
had
made
it
a
rule
to
let
the
law
take
its
course
eve
wrote
again
offering
this
time
to
renew
the
bills
and
pay
all
the
costs
hitherto
incurred
to
this
the
clerk
consented
provided
that
sechard
senior
guaranteed
payment
so
eve
walked
over
to
marsac
taking
kolb
and
her
mother
with
her
she
braved
the
old
vinedresser
and
so
charming
was
she
that
the
old
man
s
face
relaxed
and
the
puckers
smoothed
out
at
the
sight
of
her
but
when
with
inward
quakings
she
came
to
speak
of
a
guarantee
she
beheld
a
sudden
and
complete
change
of
the
tippleographic
countenance
if
i
allowed
my
son
to
put
his
hand
to
the
lips
of
my
cash
box
whenever
he
had
a
mind
he
would
plunge
it
deep
into
the
vitals
he
would
take
all
i
have
cried
old
sechard
that
is
the
way
with
children
they
eat
up
their
parents
purse
what
did
i
do
myself
eh
never
cost
my
parents
a
farthing
your
printing
office
is
standing
idle
the
rats
and
the
mice
do
all
the
printing
that
is
done
in
it
you
have
a
pretty
face
i
am
very
fond
of
you
you
are
a
careful
woman
but
that
son
of
mine
do
you
know
what
david
is
i
ll
tell
you
he
is
a
scholar
that
will
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
if
i
had
reared
him
as
i
was
reared
myself
without
knowing
his
letters
and
if
i
had
made
a
bear
of
him
like
his
father
before
him
he
would
have
money
saved
and
put
out
to
interest
by
now
oh
he
is
my
cross
that
fellow
is
look
you
and
unluckily
he
is
all
the
family
i
have
for
there
is
never
like
to
be
a
later
edition
and
when
he
makes
you
unhappy
eve
protested
with
a
vehement
gesture
of
denial
yes
he
does
affirmed
old
sechard
you
had
to
find
a
for
the
child
come
come
i
know
all
about
it
you
are
in
the
county
court
and
the
whole
town
is
talking
about
you
i
was
only
a
bear
have
no
book
learning
was
not
foreman
at
the
didots
the
first
printers
in
the
world
but
yet
i
never
set
eyes
on
a
bit
of
stamped
paper
do
you
know
what
i
say
to
myself
as
i
go
to
and
fro
among
my
vines
looking
after
them
and
getting
in
my
vintage
and
doing
my
bits
of
business
i
say
to
myself
you
are
taking
a
lot
of
trouble
poor
old
chap
working
to
pile
one
silver
crown
on
another
you
will
leave
a
fine
property
behind
you
and
the
bailiffs
and
the
lawyers
will
get
it
all
or
else
it
will
go
in
nonsensical
notions
and
look
you
here
child
you
are
the
mother
of
yonder
little
lad
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
held
him
at
the
font
with
mme
chardon
that
i
could
see
his
old
grandfather
s
copper
nose
on
his
face
very
well
think
less
of
sechard
and
more
of
that
little
rascal
i
can
trust
no
one
but
you
you
will
prevent
him
from
squandering
my
property
my
poor
but
dear
papa
sechard
your
son
will
be
a
credit
to
you
you
will
see
he
will
make
money
and
be
a
rich
man
one
of
these
days
and
wear
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
his
what
is
he
going
to
do
to
get
it
you
will
see
but
meanwhile
would
a
thousand
crowns
ruin
you
a
thousand
crowns
would
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
well
if
you
can
not
trust
him
lend
the
money
to
me
i
will
pay
it
back
you
could
make
it
a
charge
on
my
portion
on
my
earnings
then
has
some
one
brought
david
into
a
court
of
law
cried
the
vinedresser
amazed
to
find
that
the
gossip
was
really
true
see
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
write
your
name
and
how
about
my
rent
oh
little
girl
i
must
go
to
angouleme
at
once
and
ask
cachan
s
advice
and
see
that
i
am
straight
you
did
right
well
to
come
over
forewarned
is
after
two
hours
of
argument
eve
was
fain
to
go
defeated
by
the
unanswerable
women
never
understand
she
had
come
with
a
faint
hope
she
went
back
again
almost
heartbroken
and
reached
home
just
in
time
to
receive
notice
of
judgment
sechard
must
pay
metivier
in
full
the
appearance
of
a
bailiff
at
a
house
door
is
an
event
in
a
country
town
and
doublon
had
come
far
too
often
of
late
the
whole
neighborhood
was
talking
about
the
sechards
eve
dared
not
leave
her
house
she
dreaded
to
hear
the
whispers
as
she
passed
oh
my
brother
my
brother
cried
poor
eve
as
she
hurried
into
the
passage
and
up
the
stairs
i
can
never
forgive
you
unless
it
was
alas
it
was
that
or
suicide
said
david
who
had
followed
her
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
she
said
quietly
the
woman
who
dragged
him
down
into
the
depths
of
paris
has
much
to
answer
for
and
your
father
my
david
is
quite
inexorable
let
us
bear
it
in
a
discreet
rapping
at
the
door
cut
short
some
word
of
love
on
david
s
lips
marion
appeared
towing
the
big
burly
kolb
after
her
across
the
outer
room
madame
said
marion
we
have
known
kolb
and
i
that
you
and
the
master
were
very
much
put
about
and
as
we
have
eleven
hundred
francs
of
savings
between
us
we
thought
we
could
not
do
better
than
put
them
in
the
mistress
hands
die
misdress
echoed
kolb
fervently
kolb
cried
david
you
and
i
will
never
part
pay
a
thousand
francs
on
account
to
maitre
cachan
and
take
a
receipt
for
it
we
will
keep
the
rest
and
kolb
no
power
on
earth
must
extract
a
word
from
you
as
to
my
work
or
my
absences
from
home
or
the
things
you
may
see
me
bring
back
and
if
i
send
you
to
look
for
plants
for
me
you
know
no
human
being
must
set
eyes
on
you
they
will
try
to
corrupt
you
my
good
kolb
they
will
offer
you
thousands
perhaps
tens
of
thousands
of
francs
to

cried
kolb
but

as
yes
said
the
alsacien
some
tay
i
hope
to
be
rich
enough
to

der
chacket
of
dat
man
of
law
i
don
t
like
his
kolb
is
a
good
man
madame
said
big
marion
he
is
as
strong
as
a
turk
and
as
meek
as
a
lamb
just
the
one
that
would
make
a
woman
happy
it
was
his
notion
too
to
invest
our
savings
this
way
safings
as
he
calls
them
poor
man
if
he
doesn
t
speak
right
he
thinks
right
and
i
understand
him
all
the
same
he
has
a
notion
of
working
for
somebody
else
so
as
to
save
us
his
keep
surely
we
shall
be
rich
if
it
is
only
to
repay
these
good
folk
said
david
looking
at
his
wife
eve
thought
it
quite
simple
it
was
no
surprise
to
her
to
find
other
natures
on
a
level
with
her
own
the
dullest
nay
the
most
indifferent
observer
could
have
seen
all
the
beauty
of
her
nature
in
her
way
of
receiving
this
service
you
will
be
rich
some
day
dear
master
said
marion
your
bread
is
ready
baked
your
father
has
just
bought
another
farm
he
is
putting
by
money
for
you
that
he
and
under
the
circumstances
did
not
marion
show
an
exquisite
delicacy
of
feeling
by
belittling
as
it
were
her
kindness
in
this
way
french
procedure
like
all
things
human
has
its
defects
nevertheless
the
sword
of
justice
being
a
weapon
is
excellently
adapted
alike
for
attack
or
defence
procedure
moreover
has
its
amusing
side
for
when
opposed
lawyers
arrive
at
an
understanding
as
they
well
may
do
without
exchanging
a
word
through
their
manner
of
conducting
their
case
a
suit
becomes
a
kind
of
war
waged
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
first
marshal
biron
who
at
the
siege
of
rouen
it
may
be
remembered
received
his
son
s
project
for
taking
the
city
in
two
days
with
the
remark
you
must
be
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
and
plant
cabbages
let
two
spare
their
troops
as
much
as
possible
let
them
imitate
the
austrian
generals
who
give
the
men
time
to
eat
their
soup
though
they
fail
to
effect
a
juncture
and
escape
reprimand
from
the
aulic
council
let
them
avoid
all
decisive
measures
and
they
shall
carry
on
a
war
for
ever
maitre
cachan
and
doublon
did
better
than
the
austrian
generals
they
took
for
their
example
quintus
fabius
cunctator
the
austrian
of
antiquity
malignant
as
a
mule
was
not
long
in
finding
out
all
the
advantages
of
his
position
no
sooner
had
boniface
cointet
guaranteed
his
costs
than
he
vowed
to
lead
cachan
a
dance
and
to
dazzle
the
paper
manufacturer
with
a
brilliant
display
of
genius
in
the
creation
of
items
to
be
charged
to
metivier
unluckily
for
the
fame
of
the
young
forensic
figaro
the
writer
of
this
history
is
obliged
to
pass
over
the
scene
of
his
exploits
in
as
great
a
hurry
as
if
he
trod
on
burning
coals
but
a
single
bill
of
costs
in
the
shape
of
the
specimen
sent
from
paris
will
no
doubt
suffice
for
the
student
of
contemporary
manners
let
us
follow
the
example
set
us
by
the
bulletins
of
the
grande
armee
and
give
a
summary
of
s
valiant
feats
and
exploits
in
the
province
of
pure
law
they
will
be
the
better
appreciated
for
concise
treatment
david
sechard
was
summoned
before

without

on

company
were
proceeding
at
this
furious
pace
when
suddenly
pulled
them
up
and
stayed
execution
by
lodging
notice
of
appeal
on
the
notice
of
appeal
duly
reiterated
on
the
of
july
drew
metivier
off
to
poitiers
come
said
to
himself
there
we
are
likely
to
stop
for
some
time
to
no
sooner
was
the
storm
passed
over
to
poitiers
and
an
attorney
practising
in
the
instructed
to
defend
the
case
than
a
champion
facing
both
ways
made
application
in
mme
sechard
s
name
for
the
immediate
separation
of
her
estate
from
her
husband
s
using
all
diligence
in
legal
language
to
such
purpose
that
he
obtained
an
order
from
the
court
on
the
and
inserted
notice
at
once
in
the
now
david
the
lover
had
settled
ten
thousand
francs
upon
his
wife
in
the
marriage
contract
making
over
to
her
as
security
the
fixtures
of
the
printing
office
and
the
household
furniture
and
therefore
constituted
mme
sechard
her
husband
s
creditor
for
that
small
amount
drawing
up
a
statement
of
her
claims
on
the
estate
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
on
the
of
august
while
was
busy
securing
the
household
property
of
his
clients
he
gained
the
day
at
poitiers
on
the
point
of
law
on
which
the
demurrer
and
appeals
were
based
he
held
that
as
the
court
of
the
seine
had
ordered
the
plaintiff
to
pay
costs
of
proceedings
in
the
paris
commercial
court
david
was
so
much
the
less
liable
for
expenses
of
litigation
incurred
upon
lucien
s
account
the
took
this
view
of
the
case
and
judgment
was
entered
accordingly
david
sechard
was
ordered
to
pay
the
amount
in
dispute
in
the
angouleme
court
less
the
law
expenses
incurred
in
paris
these
metivier
must
pay
and
each
side
must
bear
its
own
costs
in
the
appeal
to
the
david
sechard
was
duly
notified
of
the
result
on
the
of
august
on
the
the
judgment
took
the
practical
shape
of
an
order
to
pay
capital
interest
and
costs
followed
up
by
notice
of
an
execution
for
the
morrow
upon
this
intervened
and
put
in
a
claim
for
the
furniture
as
the
wife
s
property
duly
separated
from
her
husband
s
and
what
was
more
produced
sechard
senior
upon
the
scene
of
action
the
old
vinegrower
had
become
his
client
on
this
wise
he
came
to
angouleme
on
the
day
after
eve
s
visit
and
went
to
maitre
cachan
for
advice
his
son
owed
him
arrears
of
rent
how
could
he
come
by
this
rent
in
the
scrimmage
in
which
his
son
was
engaged
i
am
engaged
by
the
other
side
pronounced
cachan
and
i
can
not
appear
for
the
father
when
i
am
suing
the
son
but
go
to
he
is
very
clever
he
may
perhaps
do
even
better
for
you
than
i
should
cachan
and
met
at
the
court
i
have
sent
you
sechard
senior
said
cachan
take
the
case
for
me
in
lawyers
do
each
other
services
of
this
kind
in
country
towns
as
well
as
in
paris
the
day
after
sechard
senior
gave
his
confidence
the
tall
cointet
paid
a
visit
to
his
confederate
try
to
give
old
sechard
a
lesson
he
said
he
is
the
kind
of
man
that
will
never
forgive
his
son
for
costing
him
a
thousand
francs
or
so
the
outlay
will
dry
up
any
generous
thoughts
in
his
mind
if
he
ever
has
go
back
to
your
vines
said
to
his
new
client
your
son
is
not
very
well
off
do
not
eat
him
out
of
house
and
home
i
will
send
for
you
when
the
time
on
behalf
of
sechard
senior
therefore
claimed
that
the
presses
being
fixtures
were
so
much
the
more
to
be
regarded
as
tools
and
implements
of
trade
and
the
less
liable
to
seizure
in
that
the
house
had
been
a
printing
office
since
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
cachan
on
metivier
s
account
waxed
indignant
at
this
in
paris
lucien
s
furniture
had
belonged
to
coralie
and
here
again
in
angouleme
david
s
goods
and
chattels
all
belonged
to
his
wife
or
his
father
pretty
things
were
said
in
court
father
and
son
were
summoned
such
claims
could
not
be
allowed
to
stand
we
mean
to
unmask
the
frauds
intrenched
behind
bad
faith
of
the
most
formidable
kind
here
is
the
defence
of
dishonesty
bristling
with
the
plainest
and
most
innocent
articles
of
the
code
and
why
to
avoid
repayment
of
three
thousand
francs
obtained
how
from
poor
metivier
s
cash
box
and
yet
there
are
those
who
dare
to
say
a
word
against
what
times
we
live
in
now
i
put
it
to
you
what
is
this
but
taking
your
neighbor
s
money
you
will
surely
not
sanction
a
claim
which
would
bring
immorality
to
the
very
core
of
justice
cachan
s
eloquence
produced
an
effect
on
the
court
a
divided
judgment
was
given
in
favor
of
mme
sechard
the
house
furniture
being
held
to
be
her
property
and
against
sechard
senior
who
was
ordered
to
pay
costs
four
hundred
and
francs
centimes
it
is
kind
of
old
sechard
laughed
the
lawyers
he
would
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
so
let
him
pay
notice
of
judgment
was
given
on
the
of
august
the
presses
and
plant
could
be
seized
on
the
placards
were
posted
application
was
made
for
an
order
empowering
them
to
sell
on
the
spot
announcements
of
the
sale
appeared
in
the
papers
and
doublon
flattered
himself
that
the
inventory
should
be
verified
and
the
auction
take
place
on
the
of
september
by
this
time
david
sechard
owed
metivier
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
francs
centimes
to
say
nothing
of
interest
by
formal
judgment
confirmed
by
appeal
the
bill
of
costs
having
been
duly
taxed
likewise
to
he
owed
twelve
hundred
francs
exclusive
of
the
fees
which
were
left
to
david
s
generosity
with
the
generous
confidence
displayed
by
the
hackney
coachman
who
has
driven
you
so
quickly
over
the
road
on
which
you
desire
to
go
mme
sechard
owed
something
like
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
and
fees
besides
and
of
old
sechard
besides
four
hundred
and
francs
centimes
the
little
attorney
demanded
a
hundred
crowns
by
way
of
fee
altogether
the
sechard
family
owed
about
ten
thousand
francs
this
is
what
is
called
putting
fire
into
the
bed
apart
from
the
utility
of
these
documents
to
other
nations
who
thus
may
behold
the
battery
of
french
law
in
action
the
french
legislator
ought
to
know
the
lengths
to
which
the
abuse
of
procedure
may
be
carried
always
supposing
that
the
said
legislator
can
find
time
for
reading
surely
some
sort
of
regulation
might
be
devised
some
way
of
forbidding
lawyers
to
carry
on
a
case
until
the
sum
in
dispute
is
more
than
eaten
up
in
costs
is
there
not
something
ludicrous
in
the
idea
of
submitting
a
square
yard
of
soil
and
an
estate
of
thousands
of
acres
to
the
same
legal
formalities
these
bare
outlines
of
the
history
of
the
various
stages
of
procedure
should
open
the
eyes
of
frenchmen
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
legal
formalities
justice
and
costs
little
as
the
immense
majority
of
the
nations
know
about
them
five
thousand
pounds
weight
of
type
in
the
printing
office
were
worth
two
thousand
francs
as
old
metal
the
three
presses
were
valued
at
six
hundred
francs
the
rest
of
the
plant
would
fetch
the
price
of
old
iron
and
firewood
the
household
furniture
would
have
brought
in
a
thousand
francs
at
most
the
whole
personal
property
of
sechard
junior
therefore
represented
the
sum
of
four
thousand
francs
and
cachan
and
made
claims
for
seven
thousand
francs
in
costs
already
incurred
to
say
nothing
of
expenses
to
come
for
the
blossom
gave
promise
of
fine
fruits
enough
as
the
reader
will
shortly
see
surely
the
lawyers
of
france
and
navarre
nay
even
of
normandy
herself
will
not
refuse
his
meed
of
admiration
and
respect
surely
too
kind
hearts
will
give
marion
and
kolb
a
tear
of
sympathy
all
through
the
war
kolb
sat
on
a
chair
in
the
doorway
acting
as
when
david
had
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
it
was
kolb
who
received
all
the
notifications
and
a
clerk
of
s
kept
watch
over
kolb
no
sooner
were
the
placards
announcing
the
auction
put
up
on
the
premises
than
kolb
tore
them
down
he
hurried
round
the
town
after
the
tearing
the
placards
from
the
walls
ah
scountrels
he
cried
to
dorment
so
goot
a
man
and
they
calls
it
chustice
marion
made
half
a
franc
a
day
by
working
half
time
in
a
paper
mill
as
a
machine
tender
and
her
wages
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
household
mme
chardon
went
back
uncomplainingly
to
her
old
occupation
sitting
up
night
after
night
and
bringing
home
her
wages
at
the
end
of
the
week
poor
mme
chardon
twice
already
she
had
made
a
nine
days
prayer
for
those
she
loved
wondering
that
god
should
be
deaf
to
her
petitions
and
blind
to
the
light
of
the
candles
on
his
altar
on
the
of
september
a
letter
came
from
lucien
the
first
since
the
letter
of
the
winter
which
david
had
kept
from
his
wife
s
knowledge
the
announcement
of
the
three
bills
which
bore
david
s
signature
this
time
lucien
wrote
to
eve
the
third
since
he
left
us
she
said
poor
sister
she
was
afraid
to
open
the
envelope
that
covered
the
fatal
sheet
she
was
feeding
the
little
one
when
the
post
came
in
they
could
not
afford
a
now
and
the
child
was
being
brought
up
by
hand
her
state
of
mind
may
be
imagined
and
david
s
also
when
he
had
been
roused
to
read
the
letter
for
david
had
been
at
work
all
night
and
only
lay
down
at
daybreak
to
paris
august
my
dear
sister
two
days
ago
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
one
of
god
s
noblest
creatures
breathed
her
last
in
my
arms
she
was
the
one
woman
on
earth
capable
of
loving
me
as
you
and
mother
and
david
love
me
giving
me
besides
that
unselfish
affection
something
that
neither
mother
nor
sister
can
give
the
utmost
bliss
of
love
poor
coralie
after
giving
up
everything
for
my
sake
may
perhaps
have
died
for
me
for
me
who
at
this
moment
have
not
the
wherewithal
to
bury
her
she
could
have
solaced
my
life
you
and
you
alone
my
dear
good
angels
can
console
me
for
her
death
god
has
forgiven
her
i
think
the
innocent
girl
for
she
died
like
a
christian
oh
this
paris
eve
paris
is
the
glory
and
the
shame
of
france
many
illusions
i
have
lost
here
already
and
i
have
others
yet
to
lose
when
i
begin
to
beg
for
the
little
money
needed
before
i
can
lay
the
body
of
my
angel
in
consecrated
earth
your
unhappy
brother
p
i
must
have
given
you
much
trouble
by
my
heedlessness
some
day
you
will
know
all
and
you
will
forgive
me
you
must
be
quite
easy
now
a
worthy
merchant
a
camusot
to
whom
i
once
caused
cruel
pangs
promised
to
arrange
everything
seeing
that
coralie
and
i
were
so
much
the
sheet
is
still
moist
with
his
tears
said
eve
looking
at
the
letter
with
a
heart
so
full
of
sympathy
that
something
of
the
old
love
for
lucien
shone
in
her
eyes
poor
fellow
he
must
have
suffered
cruelly
if
he
has
been
loved
as
he
says
exclaimed
eve
s
husband
happy
in
his
love
and
these
two
forgot
all
their
own
troubles
at
this
cry
of
a
supreme
sorrow
just
at
that
moment
marion
rushed
in
madame
she
panted
here
they
are
here
they
are
who
is
here
doublon
and
his
men
bad
luck
to
them
kolb
will
not
let
them
come
in
they
have
come
to
sell
us
no
no
they
are
not
going
to
sell
you
up
never
fear
cried
a
voice
in
the
next
room
and
appeared
upon
the
scene
i
have
just
lodged
notice
of
appeal
we
ought
not
to
sit
down
under
a
judgment
that
attaches
a
stigma
of
bad
faith
to
us
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
fight
the
case
here
i
let
cachan
talk
to
gain
time
for
you
i
am
sure
of
gaining
the
day
at
poitiers
but
how
much
will
it
cost
to
win
the
day
asked
mme
sechard
fees
if
you
win
one
thousand
francs
if
we
lose
our
oh
dear
cried
poor
eve
why
the
remedy
is
worse
than
the
disease
was
not
a
little
confused
at
this
cry
of
innocence
enlightened
by
the
progress
of
the
flames
of
litigation
it
struck
him
too
that
eve
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
middle
of
the
discussion
old
sechard
arrived
summoned
by
the
old
man
s
presence
in
the
chamber
where
his
little
grandson
in
the
cradle
lay
smiling
at
misfortune
completed
the
scene
the
young
attorney
at
once
addressed
the
newcomer
with
you
owe
me
seven
hundred
francs
for
the
interpleader
papa
sechard
but
you
can
charge
the
amount
to
your
son
in
addition
to
the
arrears
of
the
vinedresser
felt
the
sting
of
the
sarcasm
conveyed
by
s
tone
and
manner
it
would
have
cost
you
less
to
give
security
for
the
debt
at
first
said
eve
leaving
the
cradle
to
greet
her
with
a
kiss
david
quite
overcome
by
the
sight
of
the
crowd
outside
the
house
for
kolb
s
resistance
to
doublon
s
men
had
collected
a
knot
of
people
could
only
hold
out
a
hand
to
his
father
he
did
not
say
a
word
and
how
pray
do
i
come
to
owe
you
seven
hundred
francs
the
old
man
asked
looking
at
why
in
the
first
place
i
am
engaged
by
you
your
rent
is
in
question
so
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
and
our
debtor
are
one
and
the
same
person
if
your
son
does
not
pay
my
costs
in
the
case
you
must
pay
them
but
this
is
nothing
in
a
few
hours
david
will
be
put
in
prison
will
you
allow
him
to
go
what
does
he
owe
something
like
five
or
six
thousand
francs
besides
the
amounts
owing
to
you
and
to
his
the
speech
roused
all
the
old
man
s
suspicions
at
once
he
looked
round
the
little
bedroom
at
the
touching
scene
before
his
eyes
at
a
beautiful
woman
weeping
over
a
cradle
at
david
bowed
down
by
anxieties
and
then
again
at
the
lawyer
this
was
a
trap
set
for
him
by
that
lawyer
perhaps
they
wanted
to
work
upon
his
paternal
feelings
to
get
money
out
of
him
that
was
what
it
all
meant
he
took
alarm
he
went
over
to
the
cradle
and
fondled
the
child
who
held
out
both
little
arms
to
him
no
heir
to
an
english
peerage
could
be
more
tenderly
cared
for
than
this
little
one
in
that
house
of
trouble
his
little
embroidered
cap
was
lined
with
pale
pink
eh
let
david
get
out
of
it
as
best
he
may
i
am
thinking
of
this
child
here
cried
the
old
grandfather
and
the
child
s
mother
will
approve
of
that
david
that
knows
so
much
must
know
how
to
pay
his
now
i
will
just
put
your
meaning
into
plain
language
said
ironically
look
here
papa
sechard
you
are
jealous
of
your
son
hear
the
truth
you
put
david
into
his
present
position
by
selling
the
business
to
him
for
three
times
its
value
you
ruined
him
to
make
an
extortionate
bargain
yes
don
t
you
shake
your
head
you
sold
the
newspaper
to
the
cointets
and
pocketed
all
the
proceeds
and
that
was
as
much
as
the
whole
business
was
worth
you
bear
david
a
grudge
not
merely
because
you
have
plundered
him
but
because
also
your
own
son
is
a
man
far
above
yourself
you
profess
to
be
prodigiously
fond
of
your
grandson
to
cloak
your
want
of
feeling
for
your
son
and
his
wife
because
you
ought
to
pay
down
money
et
for
them
while
you
need
only
show
a
posthumous
affection
for
your
grandson
you
pretend
to
be
fond
of
the
little
fellow
lest
you
should
be
taxed
with
want
of
feeling
for
your
own
flesh
and
blood
that
is
the
bottom
of
it
papa
did
you
fetch
me
over
to
hear
this
asked
the
old
man
glowering
at
his
lawyer
his
and
his
son
in
turn
monsieur
protested
poor
eve
turning
to
have
you
vowed
to
ruin
us
my
husband
had
never
uttered
a
word
against
his
here
the
old
man
looked
cunningly
at
her
david
has
told
me
scores
of
times
that
you
loved
him
in
your
way
she
added
looking
at
her
and
understanding
his
suspicions
was
only
following
out
the
tall
cointet
s
instructions
he
was
widening
the
breach
between
the
father
and
son
lest
sechard
senior
should
extricate
david
from
his
intolerable
position
the
day
that
david
sechard
goes
to
prison
shall
be
the
day
of
your
introduction
to
mme
de
senonches
the
tall
cointet
had
said
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
mme
sechard
with
the
quick
insight
of
love
had
divined
s
mercenary
hostility
even
as
she
had
once
before
felt
instinctively
that
cerizet
was
a
traitor
as
for
david
his
astonishment
may
be
imagined
he
could
not
understand
how
came
to
know
so
much
of
his
father
s
nature
and
his
own
history
upright
and
honorable
as
he
was
he
did
not
dream
of
the
relations
between
his
lawyer
and
the
cointets
nor
for
that
matter
did
he
know
that
the
cointets
were
at
work
behind
metivier
meanwhile
old
sechard
took
his
son
s
silence
as
an
insult
and
taking
advantage
of
his
client
s
bewilderment
beat
a
retreat
my
dear
david
you
have
had
warning
notice
of
appeal
doesn
t
invalidate
the
warrant
for
arrest
it
is
the
only
course
left
open
to
your
creditors
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
take
it
so
go
away
at
once
or
rather
if
you
will
take
my
advice
go
to
the
cointets
and
see
them
about
it
they
have
capital
if
your
invention
is
perfected
and
answers
the
purpose
go
into
partnership
with
them
after
all
they
are
very
good
fellows
your
invention
broke
in
old
sechard
why
do
you
suppose
that
your
son
is
fool
enough
to
let
his
business
slip
away
from
him
without
thinking
of
something
else
exclaimed
the
attorney
he
is
on
the
brink
of
the
discovery
of
a
way
of
making
paper
at
a
cost
of
three
francs
per
ream
instead
of
ten
he
tells
one
more
dodge
for
taking
me
in
you
are
all
as
thick
as
thieves
in
a
fair
if
david
has
found
out
such
a
plan
he
has
no
need
of
me
he
is
a
millionaire
my
dears
and
a
to
you
all
and
the
old
man
disappeared
down
the
staircase
find
some
way
of
hiding
yourself
was
s
parting
word
to
david
and
with
that
he
hurried
out
to
exasperate
old
sechard
still
further
he
found
the
vinegrower
growling
to
himself
outside
in
the
place
du
murier
went
with
him
as
far
as
l
houmeau
and
there
left
him
with
a
threat
of
putting
in
an
execution
for
the
costs
due
to
him
unless
they
were
paid
before
the
week
was
out
i
will
pay
you
if
you
will
show
me
how
to
disinherit
my
son
without
injuring
my
or
the
boy
said
old
sechard
and
they
parted
forthwith
how
well
the
tall
cointet
knows
the
folk
he
is
dealing
with
it
is
just
as
he
said
those
seven
hundred
francs
will
prevent
the
father
from
paying
seven
thousand
the
little
lawyer
thought
within
himself
as
he
climbed
the
path
to
angouleme
still
that
old
slyboots
of
a
must
not
overreach
us
it
is
time
to
ask
him
for
something
besides
well
david
dear
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
eve
when
the
lawyer
had
followed
her
marion
put
your
biggest
pot
on
the
fire
called
david
i
have
my
secret
at
this
eve
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
walking
shoes
with
feverish
haste
kolb
my
friend
get
ready
to
go
out
she
said
and
come
with
me
if
there
is
any
way
out
of
this
hell
i
must
find
when
eve
had
gone
out
marion
spoke
to
david
do
be
sensible
sir
she
said
or
the
mistress
will
fret
herself
to
death
make
some
money
to
pay
off
your
debts
and
then
you
can
try
to
find
treasure
at
your
ease
don
t
talk
marion
said
david
i
am
going
to
overcome
my
last
difficulty
and
then
i
can
apply
for
the
patent
and
the
improvement
on
the
patent
at
the
same
this
improvement
on
the
patent
is
the
curse
of
the
french
patentee
a
man
may
spend
ten
years
of
his
life
in
working
out
some
obscure
industrial
problem
and
when
he
has
invented
some
piece
of
machinery
or
made
a
discovery
of
some
kind
he
takes
out
a
patent
and
imagines
that
he
has
a
right
to
his
own
invention
then
there
comes
a
competitor
and
unless
the
first
inventor
has
foreseen
all
possible
contingencies
the
second
comer
makes
an
improvement
on
the
patent
with
a
screw
or
a
nut
and
takes
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
hands
the
discovery
of
a
cheap
material
for
paper
pulp
therefore
is
by
no
means
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
david
sechard
was
anxiously
looking
ahead
on
all
sides
lest
the
fortune
sought
in
the
teeth
of
such
difficulties
should
be
snatched
out
of
his
hands
at
the
last
dutch
paper
as
flax
paper
is
still
called
though
it
is
no
longer
made
in
holland
is
slightly
sized
but
every
sheet
is
sized
separately
by
hand
and
this
increases
the
cost
of
production
if
it
were
possible
to
discover
some
way
of
sizing
the
paper
in
the
with
some
inexpensive
glue
like
that
in
use
though
even
now
it
is
not
quite
perfect
there
would
be
no
improvement
on
the
patent
to
fear
for
the
past
month
accordingly
david
had
been
making
experiments
in
sizing
pulp
he
had
two
discoveries
before
him
eve
went
to
see
her
mother
fortunately
it
so
happened
that
mme
chardon
was
nursing
the
s
wife
who
had
just
given
the
milauds
of
nevers
an
heir
presumptive
and
eve
in
her
distrust
of
all
attorneys
and
notaries
took
into
her
head
to
apply
for
advice
to
the
legal
guardian
of
widows
and
orphans
she
wanted
to
know
if
she
could
relieve
david
from
his
embarrassments
by
taking
them
upon
herself
and
selling
her
claims
upon
the
estate
and
besides
she
had
some
hope
of
discovering
the
truth
as
to
s
unaccountable
conduct
the
official
struck
with
mme
sechard
s
beauty
received
her
not
only
with
the
respect
due
to
a
woman
but
with
a
sort
of
courtesy
to
which
eve
was
not
accustomed
she
saw
in
the
magistrate
s
face
an
expression
which
since
her
marriage
she
had
seen
in
no
eyes
but
kolb
s
and
for
a
beautiful
woman
like
eve
this
expression
is
the
criterion
by
which
men
are
judged
when
passion
or
or
age
dims
that
spark
of
unquestioning
fealty
that
gleams
in
a
young
man
s
eyes
a
woman
feels
a
certain
mistrust
of
him
and
begins
to
observe
him
critically
the
cointets
cerizet
and
all
the
men
whom
eve
felt
instinctively
to
be
her
enemies
had
turned
hard
indifferent
eyes
on
her
with
the
therefore
she
felt
at
ease
although
in
spite
of
his
kindly
courtesy
he
swept
all
her
hopes
away
by
his
first
words
it
is
not
certain
madame
that
the
will
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
restricting
your
lien
on
your
husband
s
property
for
payment
of
moneys
due
to
you
by
the
terms
of
your
to
household
goods
and
chattels
your
privilege
ought
not
to
be
used
to
defraud
the
other
creditors
but
in
any
case
you
will
be
allowed
to
take
your
share
of
the
proceeds
with
the
other
creditors
and
your
likewise
as
a
privileged
creditor
for
arrears
of
rent
when
the
court
has
given
the
order
other
points
may
be
raised
as
to
the
contribution
as
we
call
it
when
a
schedule
of
the
debts
is
drawn
up
and
the
creditors
are
paid
a
dividend
in
proportion
to
their
claims
then
is
bringing
us
to
bankruptcy
she
cried
is
carrying
out
your
husband
s
instructions
said
the
magistrate
he
is
anxious
to
gain
time
so
his
attorney
says
in
my
opinion
you
would
perhaps
do
better
to
waive
the
appeal
and
buy
in
at
the
sale
the
indispensable
implements
for
carrying
on
the
business
you
and
your
together
might
do
this
you
to
the
extent
of
your
claim
through
your
marriage
contract
and
he
for
his
arrears
of
rent
but
that
would
be
bringing
the
matter
to
an
end
too
soon
perhaps
the
lawyers
are
making
a
good
thing
out
of
your
but
then
i
should
be
entirely
in
sechard
s
father
s
hands
i
should
owe
him
the
hire
of
the
machinery
as
well
as
the
and
my
husband
would
still
be
open
to
further
proceedings
from
metivier
for
metivier
would
have
had
almost
that
is
true
very
well
then
we
should
be
even
worse
off
than
we
the
arm
of
the
law
madame
is
at
the
creditor
s
disposal
you
have
received
three
thousand
francs
and
you
must
of
necessity
repay
the
oh
sir
can
you
think
that
we
are
capable
eve
suddenly
came
to
a
stop
she
saw
that
her
justification
might
injure
her
brother
oh
i
know
quite
well
that
it
is
an
obscure
affair
that
the
debtors
on
the
one
side
are
honest
scrupulous
and
even
behaving
handsomely
and
the
creditor
on
the
other
is
only
a
cat
eve
aghast
looked
at
him
with
bewildered
eyes
you
can
understand
he
continued
with
a
look
full
of
homely
shrewdness
that
we
on
the
bench
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
over
all
that
goes
on
under
our
eyes
while
the
gentlemen
in
court
are
arguing
with
each
eve
went
home
in
despair
over
her
useless
effort
that
evening
at
seven
o
clock
doublon
came
with
the
notification
of
imprisonment
for
debt
the
proceedings
had
reached
the
acute
stage
after
this
i
can
only
go
out
after
nightfall
said
david
eve
and
mme
chardon
burst
into
tears
to
be
in
hiding
was
for
them
a
shameful
thing
as
for
kolb
and
marion
they
were
more
alarmed
for
david
because
they
had
long
since
made
up
their
minds
that
there
was
no
guile
in
their
master
s
nature
so
frightened
were
they
on
his
account
that
they
came
upstairs
under
pretence
of
asking
whether
they
could
do
anything
and
found
eve
and
mme
chardon
in
tears
the
three
whose
life
had
been
so
straightforward
hitherto
were
overcome
by
the
thought
that
david
must
go
into
hiding
and
how
moreover
could
they
hope
to
escape
the
invisible
spies
who
henceforth
would
dog
every
least
movement
of
a
man
unluckily

good
kolb
said
david
we
have
still
time
to
do
kolb
hurried
off
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
bailiff
and
it
so
fell
out
that
david
s
enemies
were
in
doublon
s
office
holding
a
council
as
to
the
best
way
of
securing
him
the
arrest
of
a
debtor
is
an
thing
in
the
country
an
abnormal
proceeding
if
ever
there
was
one
everybody
in
the
first
place
knows
everybody
else
and
creditor
and
debtor
being
bound
to
meet
each
other
daily
all
their
lives
long
nobody
likes
to
take
this
odious
course
when
a
defaulter
to
use
the
provincial
term
for
a
debtor
for
they
do
not
mince
their
words
in
the
provinces
when
speaking
of
this
legalized
method
of
helping
yourself
to
another
man
s
goods
when
a
defaulter
plans
a
failure
on
a
large
scale
he
takes
sanctuary
in
paris
paris
is
a
kind
of
city
of
refuge
for
provincial
bankrupts
an
almost
impenetrable
retreat
the
writ
of
the
pursuing
bailiff
has
no
force
beyond
the
limits
of
his
jurisdiction
and
there
are
other
obstacles
rendering
it
almost
invalid
wherefore
the
paris
bailiff
is
empowered
to
enter
the
house
of
a
third
party
to
seize
the
person
of
the
debtor
while
for
the
bailiff
of
the
provinces
the
domicile
is
absolutely
inviolable
the
law
probably
makes
this
exception
as
to
paris
because
there
it
is
the
rule
for
two
or
more
families
to
live
under
the
same
roof
but
in
the
provinces
the
bailiff
who
wishes
to
make
forcible
entry
must
have
an
order
from
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
so
wide
a
discretion
is
allowed
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
he
is
practically
able
to
give
or
withhold
assistance
to
the
bailiffs
to
the
honor
of
the
justices
it
should
be
said
that
they
dislike
the
office
and
are
by
no
means
anxious
to
assist
blind
passions
or
revenge
there
are
besides
other
and
no
less
serious
difficulties
in
the
way
of
arrest
for
debt
difficulties
which
tend
to
temper
the
severity
of
legislation
and
public
opinion
not
infrequently
makes
a
dead
letter
of
the
law
in
great
cities
there
are
poor
or
degraded
wretches
enough
poverty
and
vice
know
no
scruples
and
consent
to
play
the
spy
but
in
a
little
country
town
people
know
each
other
too
well
to
earn
wages
of
the
bailiff
the
meanest
creature
who
should
lend
himself
to
dirty
work
of
this
kind
would
be
forced
to
leave
the
place
in
the
absence
of
recognized
machinery
therefore
the
arrest
of
a
debtor
is
a
problem
presenting
no
small
difficulty
it
becomes
a
kind
of
strife
of
ingenuity
between
the
bailiff
and
the
debtor
and
matter
for
many
pleasant
stories
in
the
newspapers
cointet
the
elder
did
not
choose
to
appear
in
the
affair
but
the
fat
cointet
openly
said
that
he
was
acting
for
metivier
and
went
to
doublon
taking
cerizet
with
him
cerizet
was
his
foreman
now
and
had
promised
his
in
return
for
a
note
doublon
could
reckon
upon
two
of
his
understrappers
and
thus
the
cointets
had
four
bloodhounds
already
on
the
victim
s
track
at
the
actual
time
of
arrest
doublon
could
furthermore
count
upon
the
police
force
who
are
bound
if
required
to
assist
a
bailiff
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
the
two
men
doublon
himself
and
the
visitors
were
all
closeted
together
in
the
private
office
beyond
the
public
office
on
the
ground
floor
a
tolerably
lobby
a
kind
of
led
to
the
public
office
the
gilded
scutcheons
of
the
court
with
the
word
bailiff
printed
thereon
in
large
black
letters
hung
outside
on
the
house
wall
on
either
side
the
door
both
office
windows
gave
upon
the
street
and
were
protected
by
heavy
iron
bars
but
the
private
office
looked
into
the
garden
at
the
back
wherein
doublon
an
adorer
of
pomona
grew
espaliers
with
marked
success
opposite
the
office
door
you
beheld
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
beyond
the
kitchen
the
staircase
that
ascended
to
the
first
story
the
house
was
situated
in
a
narrow
street
at
the
back
of
the
new
law
courts
then
in
process
of
construction
and
only
finished
after
these
details
are
necessary
if
kolb
s
adventures
are
to
be
intelligible
to
the
reader
it
was
kolb
s
idea
to
go
to
the
bailiff
to
pretend
to
be
willing
to
betray
his
master
and
in
this
way
to
discover
the
traps
which
would
be
laid
for
david
kolb
told
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
doublon
on
business
the
servant
was
busy
washing
up
her
plates
and
dishes
and
not
very
well
pleased
at
kolb
s
interruption
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
outer
office
and
bade
him
wait
there
till
her
master
was
at
liberty
then
as
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
she
told
the
master
in
the
private
office
that
a
man
wanted
to
speak
to
him
now
a
man
so
invariably
means
a
peasant
that
doublon
said
tell
him
to
wait
and
kolb
took
a
seat
close
to
the
door
of
the
private
office
there
were
voices
talking
within
ah
by
the
by
how
do
you
mean
to
set
about
it
for
if
we
can
catch
him
it
will
be
so
much
time
it
was
the
fat
cointet
who
spoke
nothing
easier
the
gaffer
has
come
fairly
by
his
nickname
said
cerizet
at
the
sound
of
the
fat
cointet
s
voice
kolb
guessed
at
once
that
they
were
talking
about
his
master
especially
as
the
sense
of
the
words
began
to
dawn
upon
him
but
when
he
recognized
cerizet
s
tones
his
astonishment
grew
more
and
more
und
dat
fellow
haf
eaten
his
pread
he
thought
we
must
do
it
in
this
way
boys
said
doublon
we
will
post
our
men
at
good
long
intervals
about
the
rue
de
beaulieu
and
the
place
du
murier
in
every
direction
so
that
we
can
follow
the
gaffer
i
like
that
word
without
his
knowledge
we
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
until
he
is
safe
inside
the
house
where
he
means
to
lie
in
hiding
as
he
thinks
there
we
will
leave
him
in
peace
for
awhile
then
some
fine
day
we
will
come
across
him
before
sunrise
or
but
what
is
he
doing
now
at
this
moment
he
may
be
slipping
through
our
fingers
said
the
fat
cointet
he
is
in
his
house
answered
doublon
if
he
left
it
i
should
know
i
have
one
witness
posted
in
the
place
du
murier
another
at
the
corner
of
the
law
courts
and
another
thirty
paces
from
the
house
if
our
man
came
out
they
would
whistle
he
could
not
make
three
paces
from
his
door
but
i
should
know
of
it
at
once
from
the
bailiffs
speak
of
their
understrappers
by
the
polite
title
of
here
was
better
hap
than
kolb

went
noiselessly

of

circle
traced
about

and
of

and
given

some
inkling
of

david
and
kolb
come
out
of
the

than
they
heard
a
sharp
whistle
and
were
followed
to

an

clapped
both
spurs
to

and
was
out
into
the
country
and
the
darkness
not
merely
before
the
spies
could
follow
but
before
they
had
time
to
discover
the
direction
that
he
took
eve
meanwhile
went
out
on
the
tolerably
ingenious
pretext
of
asking
advise
of
postel
sat
awhile
enduring
the
insulting
pity
that
spends
itself
in
words
left
the
postel
family
and
stole
away
unseen
to

told
her
troubles
and
asked
for
help
and
shelter
basine
for
greater
safety
had
brought
eve
into
her
bedroom
and
now
she
opened
the
door
of
a
little
closet
lighted
only
by
a
skylight
in
such
a
way
that
prying
eyes
could
not
see
into
it
the
two
friends
unstopped
the
flue
which
opened
into
the
chimney
of
the
stove
in
the
workroom
where
the
girls
heated
their
irons
eve
and
basine
spread
ragged
coverlets
over
the
brick
floor
to
deaden
any
sound
that
david
might
make
put
in
a
truckle
bed
a
stove
for
his
experiments
and
a
table
and
a
chair
basine
promised
to
bring
food
in
the
night
and
as
no
one
had
occasion
to
enter
her
room
david
might
defy
his
enemies
one
and
all
or
even
detectives
at
last
eve
said
with
her
arms
about
her
friend
at
last
he
is
in

went
back
to
postel
to
submit
a
fresh
doubt
that
had
occurred
to
her
she
said
she
would
like
the
opinion
of
such
an
experienced
member
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
she
so
managed
that
he
escorted
her
home
and
listened
patiently
to
his
commiseration
would
this
have
happened
if
you
had
married
me
all
the
little
druggist
s
remarks
were
pitched
in
this
key
then
he
went
home
again
to
find
mme
postel
jealous
of
mme
sechard
and
furious
with
her
spouse
for
his
polite
attention
to
that
beautiful
woman
the
apothecary
advanced
the
opinion
that
little
women
were
preferable
to
tall
dark
women
who
like
fine
horses
were
always
in
the
stable
he
said
he
gave
proofs
of
his
sincerity
no
doubt
for
mme
postel
was
very
sweet
to
him
next
day

kolb
your

fader

no

the
had
no
belief
in
his
son
he
judged
him
from
the
outside
point
of
view
and
waited
for
results
he
had
no
idea
to
begin
with
that
he
had
plundered
david
nor
did
he
make
allowance
for
the
very
different
circumstances
under
which
they
had
begun
life
he
said
to
himself
i
set
him
up
with
a
just
as
i
found
it
myself
and
he
knowing
a
thousand
times
more
than
i
did
can
not
keep
it
he
was
mentally
incapable
of
understanding
his
son
he
laid
the
blame
of
failure
upon
him
and
even
prided
himself
as
it
were
on
his
superiority
to
a
far
greater
intellect
than
his
own
with
the
thought
i
am
securing
his
bread

moralists
will
never
succeed
in
making
us
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
the
influence
of

as
strong
as
the

of

sentiments
for
every
law
of
our
nature

ways
and
acts
and
reacts

david
on
his
side
understood
his
father
and
in
his
sublime
charity
forgave
him
kolb
and
david
reached
marsac
at
eight
o
clock
and
suddenly
came
in
upon
the
old
man
as
he
was
finishing
his
dinner
which
by
force
of
circumstances
came
very
near
bedtime
i
see
you
because
there
is
no

said
old
sechard
with
a
sour
smile
und
how

right
remember
kolb
went
off
growling
like
a
chidden
dog
obedient
but
protesting
and
david
proposed
to
give
his
father
indisputable
proof
of
his
discovery
while
reserving
his
secret
he
offered
to
give
him
an
interest
in
the
affair
in
return
for
money
paid
down
a
sufficient
sum
to
release
him
from
his
present
difficulties
with
or
without
a
further
amount
of
capital
to
be
employed
in
developing

that

giving
his

a

vinous
it
may
be

keen
inquisitive
and
covetous
a
look
like

flash
of
lightning
from
a
sodden
cloud

faithful
to

without
a
nightcap
consisting
of
a
couple
of
bottles
of
excellent
old
wine
which
he
tippled
down
of
an
evening
to
use
his
own
expression
nothing
simpler
said
david
i
have
none
of
the
paper
about
me
for
i
came
here
to
be
out
of
doublon
s
way
and
having
come
so
far
i
thought
i
might
as
well
come
to
you
at
marsac
as
borrow
of
a
i
have
nothing
on
me
but
my
clothes
shut
me
up
somewhere
on
the
premises
so
that
nobody
can
come
in
and
see
me
at
work
and
what
you
will
not
let
me
see
you
at
your
work
then
asked
the
old
man
with
an
ugly
look
at
his
son
you
have
given
me
to
understand
plainly
father
that
in
matters
of
business
there
is
no
question
of
father
and
son
ah
you
distrust
the
father
that
gave
you
life
no
the
other
father
who
took
away
the
means
of
earning
a
each
for
himself
you
are
right
said
the
old
man
very
good
i
will
put
you
in
the
i
will
go
down
there
with
kolb
you
must
let
me
have
a
large
pot
for
my
pulp
said
david
then
he
continued
without
noticing
the
quick
look
his
father
gave
him
and
you
must
find
artichoke
and
asparagus
stalks
for
me
and
nettles
and
the
reeds
that
you
cut
by
the
stream
side
and
morning
i
will
come
out
of
your
cellar
with
some
splendid
if
you
can
do
that
hiccoughed
the
bear
i
will
let
you
have
perhaps
i
will
see
that
is
if
i
can
let
you
have
pshaw
thousand
francs
on
condition
mind
that
you
make
as
much
for
me
every
put
me
to
the
proof
i
am
quite
willing
cried
david
kolb
take
the
horse
and
go
to
mansle
quick
buy
a
large
hair
sieve
for
me
of
a
cooper
and
some
glue
of
the
grocer
and
come
back
again
as
soon
as
you
there
drink
said
old
sechard
putting
down
a
bottle
of
wine
a
loaf
and
the
cold
remains
of
the
dinner
you
will
need
your
strength
i
will
go
and
look
for
your
bits
of
green
stuff
green
rags
you
use
for
your
pulp
and
a
trifle
too
green
i
am
two
hours
later
towards
eleven
o
clock
that
night
david
and
kolb
took
up
their
quarters
in
a
little
against
the
cellar
wall
they
found
the
floor
paved
with
runnel
tiles
and
all
the
apparatus
used
in
angoumois
for
the
manufacture
of
cognac
brandy
pans
and
firewood
why
it
is
as
good
as
a
factory
made
on
purpose
cried
david
very
well
said
old
sechard
i
shall
lock
you
in
and
let
both
the
dogs
loose
nobody
will
bring
you
any
paper
i
am
sure
you
show
me
those
sheets
and
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
be
your
partner
and
the
business
will
be
straightforward
and
properly
david
and
kolb
locked
into
the
distillery
spent
nearly
two
hours
in
macerating
the
stems
using
a
couple
of
logs
for
mallets
the
fire
blazed
up
the
water
boiled
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
kolb
heard
a
sound
which
david
was
too
busy
to
notice
a
kind
of
deep
breath
like
a
suppressed
hiccough
snatching
up
one
of
the
two
lighted
dips
he
looked
round
the
walls
and
beheld
old
sechard
s
empurpled
countenance
filling
up
a
square
opening
above
a
door
hitherto
hidden
by
a
pile
of
empty
casks
in
the
cellar
itself
the
cunning
old
man
had
brought
david
and
kolb
into
his
underground
distillery
by
the
outer
door
through
which
the
casks
were
rolled
when
full
the
inner
door
had
been
made
so
that
he
could
roll
his
puncheons
straight
from
the
cellar
into
the
distillery
instead
of
taking
them
round
through
the
yard
aha

david
i

it

commented
kolb
as
he
pushed
the
casks
aside
and
flung
open
the
door
and
there
in
fact
on
a
short
the
old
man
stood
in
his
shirt
risking
your
health
said
david
i
think
i
must
be
walking
in
my
sleep
said
old
sechard
coming
down
in
confusion
your
want
of
confidence
in
your
father
set
me
dreaming
i
dreamed
you
were
making
a
pact
with
the
devil
to
do

said
david
lock

you
will
but
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
down
again
kolb
will
mount
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
david
came
out
of
the
distillery
he
had
been
careful
to
leave
no
sign
of
his
occupation
behind
him
but
he
brought
out
some
thirty
sheets
of
paper
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
in
fineness
whiteness
toughness
and
strength
all
of
them
bearing
by
way
of
the
impress
of
the
uneven
hairs
of
the
sieve
the
old
man
took
up
the
samples
and
put
his
tongue
to
them
the
lifelong
habit
of
the
pressman
who
tests
papers
in
this
way
he
felt
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
crumpled
and
creased
it
put
it
through
all
the
trials
by
which
a
printer
assays
the
quality
of
a
sample
submitted
to
him
and
when
it
was
found
wanting
in
no
respect
he
still
would
not
allow
that
he
was
beaten
we
have
yet
to
know
how
it
takes
an
impression
he
said
to
avoid
praising
his
son
funny
man
exclaimed
kolb
the
old
man
was
cool
enough
now
he
cloaked
his
feigned
hesitation
with
paternal
dignity
i
wish
to
tell
you
in
fairness
father
that
even
now
it
seems
to
me
that
paper
costs
more
than
it
ought
to
do
i
want
to
solve
the
problem
of
sizing
it
in
the
i
have
just
that
one
improvement
to
oho
so
you
are
trying
to
trick
me
well
shall
i
tell
you
i
can
size
the
pulp
as
it
is
but
so
far
i
can
not
do
it
evenly
and
the
surface
is
as
rough
as
a
burr
very
good
size
your
pulp
in
the
trough
and
you
shall
have
my
mein
master
will
nefer
see
de
golor
of
your
money
declared
kolb
father
he
began
i
have
never
borne
you
any
grudge
for
making
over
the
business
to
me
at
such
an
exorbitant
valuation
i
have
seen
the
father
through
it
all
i
have
said
to
myself
the
old
man
has
worked
very
hard
and
he
certainly
gave
me
a
better
bringing
up
than
i
had
a
right
to
expect
let
him
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
toil
in
peace
and
in
his
own
i
even
gave
up
my
mother
s
money
to
you
i
began
encumbered
with
debt
and
bore
all
the
burdens
that
you
put
upon
me
without
a
murmur
well
harassed
for
debts
that
were
not
of
my
making
with
no
bread
in
the
house
and
my
feet
held
to
the
flames
i
have
found
out
the
secret
i
have
struggled
on
patiently
till
my
strength
is
exhausted
it
is
perhaps
your
duty
to
help
me
but
do
not
give
a
thought
think
of
a
woman
and
a
little
one
david
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
at
this
think
of
them
and
give
them
help
and
kolb
and
marion
have
given
me
their
savings
will
you
do
less
he
cried
at
last
seeing
that
his
father
was
as
cold
as
the
and
that
was
not
enough
for
you
said
the
old
man
without
the
slightest
sense
of
shame
why
you
would
waste
the
wealth
of
the
indies
i
am
too
ignorant
to
lend
a
hand
in
schemes
got
up
on
purpose
to
exploit
me
a
monkey
will
never
gobble
down
a
bear
alluding
to
the
workshop
nicknames
i
am
a
vinegrower
i
am
not
a
banker
and
what
is
more
look
you
business
between
father
and
son
never
turns
out
well
stay
and
eat
your
dinner
here
you
shan
t
say
that
you
came
for
there
are
some
natures
that
can
force
their
own
pain
down
into
inner
depths
unsuspected
by
those
dearest
to
them
and
with
them
when
anguish
forces
its
way
to
the
surface
and
is
visible
it
is
only
after
a
mighty
upheaval
david
s
nature
was
one
of
these
eve
had
thoroughly
understood
the
noble
character
of
the
man
but
now
that
the
depths
had
been
stirred
david
s
father
took
the
wave
of
anguish
that
passed
over
his
son
s
features
for
a
child
s
trick
an
attempt
to
get
round
his
father
and
his
bitter
grief
for
mortification
over
the
failure
of
the
attempt
father
and
son
parted
in
anger
david
and
kolb
reached
angouleme
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
they
came
back
on
foot
and
steathily
like
burglars
before
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
david
was
installed
in
the
impenetrable
prepared
by
his
wife
in
basine
clerget
s
house
no
one
saw
him
enter
it
and
the
pity
that
henceforth
should
shelter
david
was
the
most
resourceful
pity
of
all
the
pity
of
a
kolb
bragged
that
day
that
he
had
saved
his
master
on
horseback
and
only
left
him
in
a
carrier
s
van
well
on
the
way
to
limoges
a
sufficient
provision
of
raw
material
had
been
laid
up
in
basine
s
cellar
and
kolb
marion
mme
sechard
and
her
mother
had
no
communication
with
the
house
two
days
after
the
scene
at
marsac
old
sechard
came
hurrying
to
angouleme
and
his
covetousness
had
brought
him
there
were
three
clear
weeks
ahead
before
the
vintage
began
and
he
thought
he
would
be
on
the
for
squalls
to
use
his
own
expression
to
this
end
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
one
of
the
attics
which
he
had
reserved
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
wilfully
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
bareness
and
want
that
made
his
son
s
home
desolate
if
they
owed
him
rent
they
could
well
afford
to
keep
him
he
ate
his
food
from
a
tinned
iron
plate
and
made
no
marvel
at
it
i
began
in
the
same
way
he
told
his
when
she
apologized
for
the
absence
of
silver
spoons
marion
was
obliged
to
run
into
debt
for
necessaries
for
them
all
kolb
was
earning
a
franc
for
daily
wage
as
a
s
laborer
and
at
last
poor
eve
who
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
and
child
had
sacrificed
her
last
resources
to
entertain
david
s
father
saw
that
she
had
only
ten
francs
left
she
had
hoped
to
the
last
to
soften
the
old
miser
s
heart
by
her
affectionate
respect
and
patience
and
pretty
attentions
but
old
sechard
was
obdurate
as
ever
when
she
saw
him
turn
the
same
cold
eyes
on
her
the
same
look
that
the
cointets
had
given
her
and
and
cerizet
she
tried
to
watch
and
guess
old
sechard
s
intentions
trouble
thrown
away
old
sechard
never
sober
never
drunk
was
inscrutable
intoxication
is
a
double
veil
if
the
old
man
s
tipsiness
was
sometimes
real
it
was
quite
often
feigned
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
david
s
secret
from
his
wife
sometimes
he
coaxed
sometimes
he
frightened
his
i
will
drink
up
my
property
will
buy
an
he
would
threaten
when
eve
told
him
that
she
knew
nothing
the
humiliating
struggle
was
wearing
her
out
she
kept
silence
at
last
lest
she
should
show
disrespect
to
her
husband
s
father
but
father
she
said
one
day
when
driven
to
extremity
there
is
a
very
simple
way
of
finding
out
everything
pay
david
s
debts
he
will
come
home
and
you
can
settle
it
between
ha
that
is
what
you
want
to
get
out
of
me
is
it
he
cried
it
is
as
well
to
know
but
if
sechard
had
no
belief
in
his
son
he
had
plenty
of
faith
in
the
cointets
he
went
to
consult
them
and
the
cointets
dazzled
him
of
set
purpose
telling
him
that
his
son
s
experiments
might
mean
millions
of
francs
if
david
can
prove
that
he
has
succeeded
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
go
into
partnership
with
him
and
reckon
his
discovery
as
half
the
capital
the
tall
cointet
told
him
the
suspicious
old
man
learned
a
good
deal
over
nips
of
brandy
with
the
and
something
more
by
questioning
and
feigning
stupidity
and
at
length
he
felt
convinced
that
the
cointets
were
the
real
movers
behind
metivier
they
were
plotting
to
ruin
sechard
s
printing
establishment
and
to
lure
him
sechard
on
to
pay
his
son
s
debts
by
holding
out
the
discovery
as
a
bait
the
old
man
of
the
people
did
not
suspect
that
was
in
the
plot
nor
had
he
any
idea
of
the
toils
woven
to
ensnare
the
great
secret
a
day
came
at
last
when
he
grew
angry
and
out
of
patience
with
the
who
would
not
so
much
as
tell
him
where
david
was
hiding
he
determined
to
force
the
laboratory
door
for
he
had
discovered
that
david
was
wont
to
make
his
experiments
in
the
workshop
where
the
rollers
were
melted
down
he
came
downstairs
very
early
one
morning
and
set
to
work
upon
the
lock
hey
papa
sechard
what
are
you
doing
there
marion
called
out
she
had
risen
at
daybreak
to
go
to
her
papermill
and
now
she
sprang
across
to
the
workshop
i
am
in
my
own
house
am
i
not
said
the
old
man
in
some
confusion
oh
indeed
are
you
turning
thief
in
your
old
age
you
are
not
drunk
this
time
either
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
mistress
and
tell
hold
your
tongue
marion
said
sechard
drawing
two
crowns
of
six
francs
each
from
his
pocket
there
i
will
hold
my
tongue
but
don
t
you
do
it
again
said
marion
shaking
her
finger
at
him
or
all
angouleme
shall
hear
of
the
old
man
had
scarcely
gone
out
however
when
marion
went
up
to
her
mistress
look
madame
she
said
i
have
had
twelve
francs
out
of
your
and
here
they
are
how
did
you
do
it
what
was
he
wanting
to
do
but
to
take
a
look
at
the
master
s
pots
and
pans
and
stuff
to
find
out
the
secret
forsooth
i
knew
quite
well
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
little
place
but
i
frightened
him
and
talked
as
if
he
were
setting
about
robbing
his
son
and
he
gave
me
twelve
francs
to
say
nothing
about
just
at
that
moment
basine
came
in
radiant
and
with
a
letter
for
her
friend
a
letter
from
david
written
on
magnificent
paper
which
she
handed
over
when
they
were
alone
my
adored
eve
i
am
writing
to
you
the
first
letter
on
my
first
sheet
of
paper
made
by
the
new
process
i
have
solved
the
problem
of
sizing
the
pulp
in
the
trough
at
last
a
pound
of
pulp
costs
five
sous
even
supposing
that
the
raw
material
is
grown
on
good
soil
with
special
culture
three
francs
worth
of
sized
pulp
will
make
a
ream
of
paper
at
twelve
pounds
to
the
ream
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
can
lessen
the
weight
of
books
by
the
envelope
the
letter
and
samples
enclosed
are
all
manufactured
in
different
ways
i
kiss
you
you
shall
have
wealth
now
to
add
to
our
happiness
everything
else
we
had
there
said
eve
handing
the
samples
to
her
when
the
vintage
is
over
let
your
son
have
the
money
give
him
a
chance
to
make
his
fortune
and
you
shall
be
repaid
ten
times
over
he
has
succeeded
at
last
old
sechard
hurried
at
once
to
the
cointets
every
sample
was
tested
and
minutely
examined
the
prices
from
three
to
ten
francs
per
ream
were
noted
on
each
separate
slip
some
were
sized
others
unsized
some
were
of
almost
metallic
purity
others
soft
as
japanese
paper
in
color
there
was
every
possible
shade
of
white
if
old
sechard
and
the
two
cointets
had
been
jews
examining
diamonds
their
eyes
could
not
have
glistened
more
eagerly
your
son
is
on
the
right
track
the
fat
cointet
said
at
length
very
well
pay
his
debts
returned
old
sechard
by
all
means
if
he
will
take
us
into
partnership
said
the
tall
cointet
you
are
extortioners
cried
old
sechard
you
have
been
suing
him
under
metivier
s
name
and
you
mean
me
to
buy
you
off
that
is
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
not
such
a
fool
gentlemen
the
brothers
looked
at
one
another
but
they
contrived
to
hide
their
surprise
at
the
old
miser
s
shrewdness
we
are
not
millionaires
said
fat
cointet
we
do
not
discount
bills
for
amusement
we
should
think
ourselves
well
off
if
we
could
pay
ready
money
for
our
bits
of
accounts
for
rags
and
we
still
give
bills
to
our
the
experiment
ought
to
be
tried
first
on
a
much
larger
scale
the
tall
cointet
said
coldly
sometimes
you
try
a
thing
with
a
saucepan
and
succeed
and
fail
utterly
when
you
experiment
with
bulk
you
should
help
your
son
out
of
yes
but
when
my
son
is
at
liberty
would
he
take
me
as
his
partner
that
is
no
business
of
ours
said
the
fat
cointet
my
good
man
do
you
suppose
that
when
you
have
paid
some
ten
thousand
francs
for
your
son
that
there
is
an
end
of
it
it
will
cost
two
thousand
francs
to
take
out
a
patent
there
will
be
journeys
to
paris
and
before
going
to
any
expense
it
would
be
prudent
to
do
as
my
brother
suggests
and
make
a
thousand
reams
or
so
to
try
several
whole
batches
to
make
sure
you
see
there
is
nothing
you
must
be
so
much
on
your
guard
against
as
an
i
have
a
liking
for
bread
ready
buttered
myself
added
the
tall
cointet
all
through
that
night
the
old
man
ruminated
over
this
dilemma
if
i
pay
david
s
debts
he
will
be
set
at
liberty
and
once
set
at
liberty
he
need
not
share
his
fortune
with
me
unless
he
chooses
he
knows
very
well
that
i
cheated
him
over
the
first
partnership
and
he
will
not
care
to
try
a
second
so
it
is
to
my
interest
to
keep
him
shut
up
the
wretched
the
cointets
knew
enough
of
sechard
senior
to
see
that
they
should
hunt
in
couples
all
three
said
to
themselves
experiments
must
be
tried
before
the
discovery
can
take
any
practical
shape
david
sechard
must
be
set
at
liberty
before
those
experiments
can
be
made
and
david
sechard
set
at
liberty
will
slip
through
our
everybody
involved
moreover
had
his
own
little
afterthought
for
instance
said
as
soon
as
i
am
married
i
will
slip
my
neck
out
of
the
cointets
yoke
but
till
then
i
shall
hold
the
tall
cointet
thought
i
would
rather
have
david
under
lock
and
key
and
then
i
should
be
master
of
the
old
sechard
too
thought
if
i
pay
my
son
s
debts
he
will
repay
me
with
a
thank
you
eve
hard
pressed
for
the
old
man
threatened
now
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
would
neither
reveal
her
husband
s
nor
even
send
proposals
of
a
she
could
not
feel
sure
of
finding
so
safe
a
refuge
a
second
time
set
your
son
at
liberty
she
told
her
and
then
you
shall
know
the
four
interested
persons
sat
as
it
were
with
a
banquet
spread
before
them
none
of
them
daring
to
begin
each
one
suspicious
and
watchful
of
his
neighbor
a
few
days
after
david
went
into
hiding
went
to
the
mill
to
see
the
tall
cointet
i
have
done
my
best
he
said
david
has
gone
into
prison
of
his
own
accord
somewhere
or
other
he
is
working
out
some
improvement
there
in
peace
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
if
you
have
not
gained
your
end
are
you
going
to
keep
your
promise
yes
if
we
succeed
said
the
tall
cointet
old
sechard
was
here
only
a
day
or
two
ago
he
came
to
ask
us
some
questions
as
to
the
old
miser
has
got
wind
of
his
son
s
invention
he
wants
to
turn
it
to
his
own
account
so
there
is
some
hope
of
a
partnership
you
are
with
the
father
and
the
son
be
the
third
person
in
the
trinity
and
give
them
up
smiled
yes
said
cointet
when
you
have
david
in
prison
or
bound
to
us
by
a
deed
of
partnership
you
shall
marry
mlle
de
la
is
that
your
my
qua
said
cointet
since
we
are
speaking
in
foreign
then
here
is
mine
in
plain
language
said
drily
ah
let
us
have
it
answered
cointet
with
some
curiosity
you
will
present
me
to
mme
de
sononches
and
do
something
definite
for
me
you
will
keep
your
word
in
short
or
i
will
clear
off
sechard
s
debts
myself
sell
my
practice
and
go
into
partnership
with
him
i
will
not
be
duped
you
have
spoken
out
and
i
am
doing
the
same
i
have
given
proof
give
me
proof
of
your
sincerity
you
have
all
and
i
have
nothing
if
you
won
t
do
fairly
by
me
i
know
your
cards
and
i
shall
play
for
my
own
the
tall
cointet
took
his
hat
and
umbrella
his
face
at
the
same
time
taking
its
jesuitical
expression
and
out
he
went
bidding
come
with
him
you
shall
see
my
friend
whether
i
have
prepared
your
way
for
you
said
he
the
shrewd
saw
his
danger
at
a
glance
and
saw
too
that
with
a
man
like
it
was
better
to
play
above
board
partly
to
be
prepared
for
contingencies
partly
to
satisfy
his
conscience
he
had
dropped
a
word
or
two
to
the
point
in
the
ear
of
the
under
the
pretext
of
putting
mlle
de
la
haye
s
financial
position
before
that
gentleman
i
have
the
man
for
francoise
he
had
said
for
with
thirty
thousand
francs
of
a
girl
must
not
expect
too
much
we
will
talk
it
over
later
on
answered
francis
du
hautoy
mme
de
senonches
positon
has
altered
very
much
since
mme
de
bargeton
went
away
we
very
likely
might
marry
francoise
to
some
elderly
country
she
would
disgrace
herself
if
you
did
cointet
returned
in
his
dry
way
better
marry
her
to
some
capable
ambitious
young
man
you
could
help
him
with
your
influence
and
he
would
make
a
good
position
for
his
we
shall
see
said
francis
du
hautoy
her
godmother
ought
to
be
consulted
first
in
any
when
de
bargeton
died
his
wife
sold
the
great
house
in
the
rue
du
minage
mme
de
senonches
finding
her
own
house
scarcely
large
enough
persuaded
de
senonches
to
buy
the
hotel
de
bargeton
the
cradle
of
lucien
chardon
s
ambitions
the
scene
of
the
earliest
events
in
his
career
zephirine
de
senonches
had
it
in
mind
to
succeed
to
mme
de
bargeton
she
too
would
be
a
kind
of
queen
in
angouleme
she
would
have
a
salon
and
be
a
great
lady
in
short
there
was
a
schism
in
angouleme
a
strife
dating
from
the
late
de
bargeton
s
duel
with
de
chandour
some
maintained
that
louise
de
negrepelisse
was
blameless
others
believed
in
stanislas
de
chandour
s
scandals
mme
de
senonches
declared
for
the
bargetons
and
began
by
winning
over
that
faction
many
frequenters
of
the
hotel
de
bargeton
had
been
so
accustomed
for
years
to
their
nightly
game
of
cards
in
the
house
that
they
could
not
leave
it
and
mme
de
senonches
turned
this
fact
to
account
she
received
every
evening
and
certainly
gained
all
the
ground
lost
by
amelie
de
chandour
who
set
up
for
a
rival
francis
du
hautoy
living
in
the
inmost
circle
of
nobility
in
angouleme
went
so
far
as
to
think
of
marrying
francoise
to
old
de
severac
mme
du
brossard
having
totally
failed
to
capture
that
gentleman
for
her
daughter
and
when
mme
de
bargeton
reappeared
as
the
prefect
s
wife
zephirine
s
hopes
for
her
dear
goddaughter
waxed
high
indeed
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
so
she
argued
would
be
sure
to
use
her
influence
for
her
champion
boniface
cointet
had
angouleme
at
his
fingers
ends
he
saw
all
the
difficulties
at
a
glance
and
resolved
to
sweep
them
out
of
the
way
by
a
bold
stroke
that
only
a
tartuffe
s
brain
could
invent
the
puny
lawyer
was
not
a
little
amused
to
find
his
keeping
his
word
with
him
not
a
word
did
utter
he
respected
the
musings
of
his
companion
and
they
walked
the
whole
way
from
the
to
the
rue
du
minage
in
silence
monsieur
and
madame
are
at
breakfast
this
announcement
met
the
visitors
on
the
steps
take
in
our
names
all
the
same
said
the
tall
cointet
and
feeling
sure
of
his
position
he
followed
immediately
behind
the
servant
and
introduced
his
companion
to
the
zephirine
who
was
breakfasting
in
company
with
francis
du
hautoy
and
mlle
de
la

gone
as
usual
for

the
young
lawyer
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
madame
he
will
go
through
the
trust
accounts
when
your
fair
ward
comes
of
the
made
a
quick
scrutiny
of
who
for
his
part
was
looking
furtively
at
the
fair
as
for
zephirine
who
heard
of
the
matter
for
the
first
time
her
surprise
was
so
great
that
she
dropped
her
fork
mlle
de
la
haye
a
shrewish
young
woman
with
an
face
a
waist
that
could
scarcely
be
called
slender
a
thin
figure
and
colorless
fair
hair
in
spite
of
a
certain
little
air
that
she
had
was
by
no
means
easy
to
marry
the
parentage
unknown
on
her
birth
certificate
was
the
real
bar
to
her
entrance
into
the
sphere
where
her
godmother
s
affection
stove
to
establish
her
mlle
de
la
haye
ignorant
of
her
real
position
was
very
hard
to
please
the
richest
merchant
in
l
houmeau
had
found
no
favor
in
her
sight
cointet
saw
the
sufficiently
significant
expression
of
the
young
lady
s
face
at
the
sight
of
the
little
lawyer
and
turning
beheld
a
precisely
similar
grimace
on
s
countenance
mme
de
senonches
and
francis
looked
at
each
other
as
if
in
search
of
an
excuse
for
getting
rid
of
the
visitors
all
this
cointet
saw
he
asked
du
hautoy
for
the
favor
of
a
few
minutes
speech
with
him
and
the
pair
went
together
into
the
fatherly
affection
is
blinding
you
sir
he
said
bluntly
you
will
not
find
it
an
easy
thing
to
marry
your
daughter
and
acting
in
your
interest
throughout
i
have
put
you
in
a
position
from
which
you
can
not
draw
back
for
i
am
fond
of
francoise
she
is
my
ward
now
knows
his
overweening
ambition
is
a
guarantee
for
our
dear
child
s
happiness
for
in
the
first
place
francoise
will
do
as
she
likes
with
her
husband
and
in
the
second
he
wants
your
influence
you
can
ask
the
new
prefect
for
the
post
of
crown
attorney
for
him
in
the
court
here
milaud
is
definitely
appointed
to
nevers
will
sell
his
practice
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
deputy
public
prosecutor

place
for
him
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
becomes
attorney
for

what
you
francis
went
back
to
the
and
behaved
charmingly
to
his
daughter
s
suitor
he
gave
mme
de
senonches
a
look
and
brought
the
scene
to
a
close
with
an
invitation
to
dine
with
them
on
the
morrow
must
come
and
discuss
the
business
in
hand
he
even
went
downstairs
and
as
far
as
the
corner
with
the
visitors
telling
that
after
cointet
s
recommendation
both
he
and
mme
de
senonches
were
disposed
to
approve
all
that
mlle
de

arranged
for
the
welfare
of
that
little
angel
oh
cried
as
they
came
away
what
a
plain
girl
i
have
been
taken
in
she
looks
a
girl
returned
cointet
and
besides
if
she
were
a
beauty
would
they
give
her
to
you
eh
my
dear
fellow
thirty
thousand
francs
and
the
influence
of
mme
de
senonches
and
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
many
a
small
landowner
would
be
wonderfully
glad
of
the
chance
and
all
the
more
so
since
francis
du
hautoy
is
never
likely
to
marry
and
all
that
he
has
will
go
to
the
girl
your
marriage
is
as
good
as
how
that
is
what
i
am
just
going
to
tell
you
returned
cointet
and
he
gave
his
companion
an
account
of
his
recent
bold
stroke

just
about
to
be
appointed
attorney
for
the
crown

dear
fellow

in
ten
years
time
you
will
be
keeper
of
the
seals

are
not
the
kind
of
a
man
to
draw
back
from
any
service
required
of
you

the
very
well
said

zeal
stirred
by
the
prospect
of
such
a
career

well

place

will
see
old

the
meantime
we
will
have
a
deed

partnership
drawn
up

the

be
bound
thereby
and
delivered
to
the
third

to
to
return
to
lucien
in
paris
on
the
morrow
of
the
loss
announced
in
his
letter
he
obtained
a
for
his
passport
bought
a
stout
holly
stick
and
went
to
the
rue
d
enfer
to
take
a
place
in
the
little
market
van
which
took
him
as
far
as
longjumeau
for
half
a
franc
he
was
going
home
to
angouleme
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
s
tramp
he
slept
in
a
cowshed
two
leagues
from
arpajon
he
had
come
no
farther
than
orleans
before
he
was
very
weary
and
almost
ready
to
break
down
but
there
he
found
a
boatman
willing
to
bring
him
as
far
as
tours
for
three
francs
and
food
during
the
journey
cost
him
but
forty
sous
five
days
of
walking
brought
him
from
tours
to
poitiers
and
left
him
with
but
five
francs
in
his
pockets
but
he
summoned
up
all
his
remaining
strength
for
the
journey
before
him
he
was
overtaken
by
night
in
the
open
country
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
sleep
out
of
doors
when
a
traveling
carriage
passed
by
slowly
climbing
the
hillside
and
all
unknown
to
the
postilion
the
occupants
and
the
servant
he
managed
to
slip
in
among
the
luggage
crouching
in
between
two
trunks
lest
he
should
be
shaken
off
by
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
and
so
he
slept
he
awoke
with
the
sun
shining
into
his
eyes
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
his
ears
the
carriage
had
come
to
a
standstill
looking
about
him
he
knew
that
he
was
at
mansle
the
little
town
where
he
had
waited
for
mme
de
bargeton
eighteen
months
before
when
his
heart
was
full
of
hope
and
love
and
joy
a
group
of
eyed
him
curiously
and
suspiciously
covered
with
dust
as
he
was
wedged
in
among
the
luggage
lucien
jumped
down
but
before
he
could
speak
two
travelers
stepped
out
of
the
caleche
and
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
for
there
stood
the
new
prefect
of
the
charente
sixte
du
chatelet
and
his
wife
louise
de
negrepelisse
chance
gave
us
a
if
we
had
but
known
said
the
countess
come
in
with
us
lucien
gave
the
couple
a
distant
bow
and
a
glance
then
he
turned
away
into
a
road
in
search
of
some
farmhouse
where
he
might
make
a
breakfast
on
milk
and
bread
and
rest
awhile
and
think
quietly
over
the
future
he
still
had
three
francs
left
on
and
on
he
walked
with
the
hurrying
pace
of
fever
noticing
as
he
went
down
by
the
riverside
that
the
country
grew
more
and
more
picturesque
it
was
near
when
he
came
upon
a
sheet
of
water
with
willows
growing
about
the
margin
and
stopped
for
awhile
to
rest
his
eyes
on
the
cool
leaves
and
something
of
the
grace
of
the
fields
entered
into
his
soul
in
among
the
crests
of
the
willows
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
mill
on
a
branch
stream
and
of
the
thatched
roof
of
the
where
the
were
growing
for
all
ornament
the
quaint
cottage
was
covered
with
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
and
climbing
hops
and
the
garden
about
it
was
gay
with
phloxes
and
tall
plants
nets
lay
drying
in
the
sun
along
a
paved
causeway
raised
above
the
highest
flood
level
and
secured
by
massive
piles
ducks
were
swimming
in
the
clear
below
the
currents
of
water
roaring
over
the
wheel
as
the
poet
came
nearer
he
heard
the
clack
of
the
mill
and
saw
the
homely
woman
of
the
house
knitting
on
a
garden
bench
and
keeping
an
eye
upon
a
little
one
who
was
chasing
the
hens
about
lucien
came
forward
my
good
woman
he
said
i
am
tired
out
i
have
a
fever
on
me
and
i
have
only
three
francs
will
you
undertake
to
give
me
brown
bread
and
milk
and
let
me
sleep
in
the
barn
for
a
week
i
shall
have
time
to
write
to
my
people
and
they
will
either
come
to
fetch
me
or
send
me
i
am
quite
willing
always
supposing
that
my
husband
has
no
hey
little
man
the
miller
came
up
gave
lucien
a
look
over
and
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
remark
three
francs
for
a
weeks
board
you
might
as
well
pay
nothing
at
perhaps
i
shall
end
as
a
miller
s
man
thought
the
poet
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
lovely
country
then
the
miller
s
wife
made
a
bed
ready
for
him
and
lucien
lay
down
and
slept
so
long
that
his
hostess
was
frightened
courtois
she
said
next
day
at
noon
just
go
in
and
see
whether
that
young
man
is
dead
or
alive
he
has
been
lying
there
these
fourteen
the
miller
was
busy
spreading
out
his
and
lines
it
is
my
belief
he
said
that
the
pretty
fellow
yonder
is
some
starveling
without
a
brass
farthing
to
bless
himself
what
makes
you
think
that
little
man
asked
the
mistress
of
the
mill
lord
he
is
not
a
prince
nor
a
lord
nor
a
member
of
parliament
nor
a
bishop
why
are
his
hands
as
white
as
if
he
did
nothing
then
it
is
very
strange
that
he
does
not
feel
hungry
and
wake
up
retorted
the
miller
s
wife
she
had
just
prepared
breakfast
for
yesterday
s
chance
guest
a
is
he
she
continued
where
will
he
be
going
it
is
too
early
yet
for
the
fair
at
but
neither
the
miller
nor
his
wife
suspected
that
actors
princes
and
bishops
apart
there
is
a
kind
of
being
who
is
both
prince
and
actor
and
invested
besides
with
a
magnificent
order
of
priesthood
that
the
poet
seems
to
do
nothing
yet
reigns
over
all
humanity
when
he
can
paint
humanity
what
can
he
be
courtois
asked
of
his
wife
suppose
it
should
be
dangerous
to
take
him
in
queried
she
pooh
thieves
look
more
alive
than
that
we
should
have
been
robbed
by
this
time
returned
her
spouse
i
am
neither
a
prince
nor
a
thief
nor
a
bishop
nor
an
actor
lucien
said
wearily
he
must
have
overheard
the
colloquy
through
the
window
and
now
he
suddenly
appeared
i
am
poor
i
am
tired
out
i
have
come
on
foot
from
paris
my
name
is
lucien
de
rubempre
and
my
father
was
chardon
who
used
to
have
postel
s
business
in
l
houmeau
my
sister
married
david
sechard
the
printer
in
the
place
du
murier
at
stop
a
bit
said
the
miller
that
printer
is
the
son
of
the
old
skinflint
who
farms
his
own
land
at
marsac
isn
t
he
the
very
same
said
lucien
he
is
a
queer
kind
of
father
he
is
courtois
continued
he
is
worth
two
hundred
thousand
francs
and
more
without
counting
his
and
he
has
sold
his
son
up
they
when
body
and
soul
have
been
broken
by
a
prolonged
painful
struggle
there
comes
a
crisis
when
a
strong
nature
braces
itself
for
greater
effort
but
those
who
give
way
under
the
strain
either
die
or
sink
into
unconsciousness
like
death
that
hour
of
crisis
had
struck
for
lucien
at
the
vague
rumor
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
david
he
seemed
almost
ready
to
succumb
oh
my
sister
he
cried
oh
god
what
have
i
done
base
wretch
that
i
am
he
dropped
down
on
the
wooden
bench
looking
white
and
powerless
as
a
dying
man
the
miller
s
wife
brought
out
a
bowl
of
milk
and
made
him
drink
but
he
begged
the
miller
to
help
him
back
to
his
bed
and
asked
to
be
forgiven
for
bringing
a
dying
man
into
their
house
he
thought
his
last
hour
had
come
with
the
shadow
of
death
thoughts
of
religion
crossed
a
brain
so
quick
to
conceive
picturesque
fancies
he
would
see
the
cure
he
would
confess
and
receive
the
last
sacraments
the
moan
uttered
in
the
faint
voice
by
a
young
man
with
such
a
comely
face
and
figure
went
to
mme
courtois
heart
i
say
little
man
just
take
the
horse
and
go
to
marsac
and
ask
marron
to
come
and
see
this
young
man
he
is
in
a
very
bad
way
it
seems
to
me
and
you
might
bring
the
cure
as
well
perhaps
they
may
know
more
about
that
printer
in
the
place
du
murier
than
you
do
for
postel
married
marron
s
courtois
departed
the
miller
s
wife
tried
to
make
lucien
take
food
like
all
folk
she
was
full
of
the
idea
that
sick
folk
must
be
made
to
eat
he
took
no
notice
of
her
but
gave
way
to
a
violent
storm
of
remorseful
grief
a
kind
of
mental
process
of
which
relieved
him
the
courtois
mill
lies
a
league
away
from
marsac
the
town
of
the
district
and
the
between
mansle
and
angouleme
so
it
was
not
long
before
the
good
miller
came
back
with
the
doctor
and
the
cure
both
functionaries
had
heard
rumors
coupling
lucien
s
name
with
the
name
of
mme
de
bargeton
and
now
when
the
whole
department
was
talking
of
the
lady
s
marriage
to
the
new
prefect
and
her
return
to
angouleme
as
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
both
cure
and
doctor
were
consumed
with
a
violent
curiosity
to
know
why
de
bargeton
s
widow
had
not
married
the
young
poet
with
whom
she
had
left
angouleme
and
when
they
heard
furthermore
that
lucien
was
at
the
mill
they
were
eager
to
know
whether
the
poet
had
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
curiosity
and
humanity
alike
prompted
them
to
go
at
once
to
the
dying
man
two
hours
after
courtois
set
out
lucien
heard
the
rattle
of
old
iron
over
the
stony
causeway
the
country
doctor
s
ramshackle
chaise
came
up
to
the
door
and
out
stepped
mm
marron
for
the
cure
was
the
doctor
s
uncle
lucien
s
bedside
visitors
were
as
intimate
with
david
s
father
as
country
neighbors
usually
are
in
a
small
township
the
doctor
looked
at
the
dying
man
felt
his
pulse
and
examined
his
tongue
then
he
looked
at
the
miller
s
wife
and
smiled
reassuringly
mme
courtois
said
he
if
as
i
do
not
doubt
you
have
a
bottle
of
good
wine
somewhere
in
the
cellar
and
a
fat
eel
in
your
put
them
before
your
patient
it
is
only
exhaustion
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
him
our
great
man
will
be
on
his
feet
again
ah
monsieur
said
lucien
it
is
not
the
body
it
is
the
mind
that
ails
these
good
people
have
told
me
tidings
that
nearly
killed
me
i
have
just
heard
the
bad
news
of
my
sister
mme
sechard
mme
courtois
says
that
your
daughter
is
married
to
postel
monsieur
so
you
must
know
something
of
david
sechard
s
affairs
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
monsieur
tell
me
what
you
know
why
he
must
be
in
prison
began
the
doctor
his
father
would
not
help
him
repeated
lucien
and
why
because
some
bills
came
from
paris
he
had
overlooked
them
no
doubt
for
he
does
not
pay
much
attention
to
his
business
they
say
said
marron
pray
leave
me
with
le
cure
said
the
poet
with
a
visible
change
of
countenance
the
doctor
and
the
miller
and
his
wife
went
out
of
the
room
and
lucien
was
left
alone
with
the
old
priest
sir
he
said
i
feel
that
death
is
near
and
i
deserve
to
die
i
am
a
very
miserable
wretch
i
can
only
cast
myself
into
the
arms
of
religion
i
sir
have
brought
all
these
troubles
on
my
sister
and
brother
for
david
sechard
has
been
a
brother
to
me
i
drew
those
bills
that
david
could
not
meet
i
have
ruined
him
in
my
terrible
misery
i
forgot
the
crime
a
millionaire
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
and
i
quite
believed
that
he
had
met
the
bills
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
been
done
it
and
lucien
told
the
tale
of
his
sorrows
the
story
as
he
told
it
in
his
feverish
excitement
was
worthy
of
the
poet
he
besought
the
cure
to
go
to
angouleme
and
to
ask
for
news
of
eve
and
his
mother
mme
chardon
and
to
let
him
know
the
truth
and
whether
it
was
still
possible
to
repair
the
evil
i
shall
live
till
you
come
back
sir
he
added
as
the
hot
tears
fell
if
my
mother
and
sister
and
david
do
not
cast
me
off
i
shall
not
lucien
s
remorse
was
terrible
to
see
the
tears
the
eloquence
the
young
white
face
with
the
heartbroken
despairing
look
the
tales
of
sorrow
upon
sorrow
till
human
strength
could
no
more
endure
all
these
things
aroused
the
cure
s
pity
and
interest
in
the
provinces
as
in
paris
he
said
you
must
believe
only
half
of
all
that
you
hear
do
not
alarm
yourself
a
piece
of
hearsay
three
leagues
away
from
angouleme
is
sure
to
be
far
from
the
truth
old
sechard
our
neighbor
left
marsac
some
days
ago
very
likely
he
is
busy
settling
his
son
s
difficulties
i
am
going
to
angouleme
i
will
come
back
and
tell
you
whether
you
can
return
home
your
confessions
and
repentance
will
help
to
plead
your
the
cure
did
not
know
that
lucien
had
repented
so
many
times
during
the
last
eighteen
months
that
penitence
however
impassioned
had
come
to
be
a
kind
of
drama
with
him
played
to
perfection
played
so
far
in
all
good
faith
but
none
the
less
a
drama
to
the
cure
succeeded
the
doctor
he
saw
that
the
patient
was
passing
through
a
nervous
crisis
and
the
danger
was
beginning
to
subside
the
spoke
as
comfortably
as
the
and
at
length
the
patient
was
persuaded
to
take
nourishment
meanwhile
the
cure
knowing
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
countryside
had
gone
to
mansle
the
coach
from
ruffec
to
angouleme
was
due
to
pass
about
that
time
and
he
found
a
vacant
place
in
it
he
would
go
to
his
postel
in
l
houmeau
david
s
former
rival
and
make
inquiries
of
him
from
the
assiduity
with
which
the
little
druggist
assisted
his
venerable
relative
to
alight
from
the
abominable
cage
which
did
duty
as
a
coach
between
ruffec
and
angouleme
it
was
apparent
to
the
meanest
understanding
that
and
mme
postel
founded
their
hopes
of
future
ease
upon
the
old
cure
s
will
have
you
breakfasted
will
you
take
something
we
did
not
in
the
least
expect
you
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
out
came
questions
innumerable
in
a
breath
mme
postel
might
have
been
born
to
be
the
wife
of
an
apothecary
in
l
houmeau
she
was
a
woman
about
the
same
height
as
little
postel
himself
such
good
looks
as
she
possessed
being
entirely
due
to
youth
and
health
her
florid
auburn
hair
grew
very
low
upon
her
forehead
her
demeanor
and
language
were
in
keeping
with
homely
features
a
round
countenance
the
red
cheeks
of
a
country
damsel
and
eyes
that
might
almost
be
described
as
yellow
everything
about
her
said
plainly
enough
that
she
had
been
married
for
expectations
of
money
after
a
year
of
married
life
therefore
she
ruled
the
house
and
postel
only
too
happy
to
have
discovered
the
heiress
meekly
submitted
to
his
wife
mme
leonie
postel
marron
was
nursing
her
first
child
the
darling
of
the
old
cure
the
doctor
and
postel
a
repulsive
infant
with
a
strong
likeness
to
both
parents
well
uncle
said
leonie
what
has
brought
you
to
angouleme
since
you
will
not
take
anything
and
no
sooner
come
in
than
you
talk
of
going
but
when
the
venerable
ecclesiastic
brought
out
the
names
of
david
sechard
and
eve
little
postel
grew
very
red
and
leonie
his
wife
felt
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
give
him
a
jealous
glance
the
glance
that
a
wife
never
fails
to
give
when
she
is
perfectly
sure
of
her
husband
and
gives
a
look
into
the
past
by
way
of
a
caution
for
the
future
what
have
yonder
folk
done
to
you
uncle
that
you
should
mix
yourself
up
in
their
affairs
inquired
leonie
with
very
perceptible
tartness
they
are
in
trouble
my
girl
said
the
cure
and
he
told
the
postels
about
lucien
at
the
courtois
mill
oh
so
that
is
the
way
he
came
back
from
paris
is
it
exclaimed
postel
yet
he
had
some
brains
poor
fellow
and
he
was
ambitious
too
he
went
out
to
look
for
wool
and
comes
home
shorn
but
what
does
he
want
here
his
sister
is
frightfully
poor
for
all
these
geniuses
david
and
lucien
alike
know
very
little
about
business
there
was
some
talk
of
him
at
the
tribunal
and
as
judge
i
was
obliged
to
sign
the
warrant
of
execution
it
was
a
painful
duty
i
do
not
know
whether
the
sister
s
circumstances
are
such
that
lucien
can
go
to
her
but
in
any
case
the
little
room
that
he
used
to
occupy
here
is
at
liberty
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
offer
it
to
that
is
right
postel
said
the
priest
he
bestowed
a
kiss
on
the
infant
slumbering
in
leonie
s
arms
and
adjusting
his
cocked
hat
prepared
to
walk
out
of
the
shop
you
will
dine
with
us
uncle
of
course
said
mme
postel
if
once
you
meddle
in
these
people
s
affairs
it
will
be
some
time
before
you
have
done
my
husband
will
drive
you
back
again
in
his
little
husband
and
wife
stood
watching
their
valued
aged
relative
on
his
way
into
angouleme
he
carries
himself
well
for
his
age
all
the
same
remarked
the
druggist
by
this
time
david
had
been
in
hiding
for
eleven
days
in
a
house
only
two
doors
away
from
the
druggist
s
shop
which
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
had
just
quitted
to
climb
the
steep
path
into
angouleme
with
the
news
of
lucien
s
present
condition
when
the
abbe
marron
debouched
upon
the
place
du
murier
he
found
three
men
each
one
remarkable
in
his
own
way
and
all
of
them
bearing
with
their
whole
weight
upon
the
present
and
future
of
the
hapless
voluntary
prisoner
there
stood
old
sechard
the
tall
cointet
and
his
confederate
the
puny
limb
of
the
law
three
men
representing
three
phases
of
greed
as
widely
different
as
the
outward
forms
of
the
speakers
the
first
had
it
in
his
mind
to
sell
his
own
son
the
second
to
betray
his
client
and
the
third
while
bargaining
for
both
iniquities
was
inwardly
resolved
to
pay
for
neither
it
was
nearly
five
o
clock
on
their
way
home
to
dinner
stopped
a
moment
to
look
at
the
group
what
the
devil
can
old
sechard
and
the
tall
cointet
have
to
say
to
each
other
asked
the
more
curious
there
was
something
on
foot
concerning
that
miserable
wretch
that
leaves
his
wife
and
child
and
to
starve
suggested
some
talk
of
sending
a
boy
to
paris
to
learn
his
trade
said
a
provincial
oracle
m
le
cure
what
brings
you
here
eh
exclaimed
old
sechard
catching
sight
of
the
abbe
as
soon
as
he
appeared
i
have
come
on
account
of
your
family
answered
the
old
man
here
is
another
of
my
son
s
notions
exclaimed
old
sechard
it
would
not
cost
you
much
to
make
everybody
happy
all
round
said
the
priest
looking
at
the
windows
of
the
mme
sechard
s
beautiful
face
appeared
at
that
moment
between
the
curtains
she
was
hushing
her
child
s
cries
by
tossing
him
in
her
arms
and
singing
to
him
are
you
bringing
news
of
my
son
asked
old
sechard
or
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
money
no
answered
marron
i
am
bringing
the
sister
news
of
her
of
lucien
cried
yes
he
walked
all
the
way
from
paris
poor
young
man
i
found
him
at
the
courtois
house
he
was
worn
out
with
misery
and
fatigue
oh
he
is
very
much
to
be
took
the
tall
cointet
by
the
arm
saying
aloud
if
we
are
going
to
dine
with
mme
de
senonches
it
is
time
to
when
they
had
come
away
a
few
paces
he
added
for
his
companion
s
benefit
catch
the
cub
and
you
will
soon
have
the
dam
we
have
david
now
i
have
found
you
a
wife
find
me
a
partner
said
the
tall
cointet
with
a
treacherous
smile
lucien
is
an
old
of
mine
we
used
to
be
chums
i
shall
be
sure
to
hear
something
from
him
in
a
week
s
time
have
the
banns
put
up
and
i
will
engage
to
put
david
in
prison
when
he
is
on
the
jailer
s
register
i
shall
have
done
my
ah
exclaimed
the
tall
cointet
under
his
breath
we
might
have
the
patent
taken
out
in
our
name
that
would
be
the
thing
a
shiver
ran
through
the
meagre
little
attorney
when
he
heard
those
words
meanwhile
eve
beheld
her
enter
with
the
abbe
marron
who
had
let
fall
a
word
which
unfolded
the
whole
tragedy
here
is
our
cure
mme
sechard
the
old
man
said
addressing
his
and
pretty
tales
about
your
brother
he
has
to
tell
us
no
doubt
oh
cried
poor
eve
cut
to
the
heart
what
can
have
happened
now
the
cry
told
so
unmistakably
of
many
sorrows
of
great
dread
on
so
many
grounds
that
the
abbe
marron
made
haste
to
say
reassure
yourself
madame
he
is
eve
turned
to
the
vinegrower
father
she
said
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
go
to
my
mother
she
must
hear
all
that
this
gentleman
has
to
tell
us
of
the
old
man
went
in
search
of
mme
chardon
and
addressed
her
in
this
wise
go
and
have
it
out
with
the
abbe
marron
he
is
a
good
sort
priest
though
he
is
dinner
will
be
late
no
doubt
i
shall
come
back
again
in
an
hour
and
the
old
man
went
out
insensible
as
he
was
to
everything
but
the
clink
of
money
and
the
glitter
of
gold
he
left
mme
chardon
without
caring
to
notice
the
effect
of
the
shock
that
he
had
given
her
mme
chardon
had
changed
so
greatly
during
the
last
eighteen
months
that
in
that
short
time
she
no
longer
looked
like
the
same
woman
the
troubles
hanging
over
both
of
her
children
her
abortive
hopes
for
lucien
the
unexpected
deterioration
in
one
in
whose
powers
and
honesty
she
had
for
so
long
believed
all
these
things
had
told
heavily
upon
her
mme
chardon
was
not
only
noble
by
birth
she
was
noble
by
nature
she
idolized
her
children
consequently
during
the
last
six
months
she
had
suffered
as
never
before
since
her
widowhood
lucien
might
have
borne
the
name
of
lucien
de
rubempre
by
royal
letters
patent
he
might
have
founded
the
family
anew
revived
the
title
and
borne
the
arms
he
might
have
made
a
great
name
he
had
thrown
the
chance
away
nay
he
had
fallen
into
the
mire
for
mme
chardon
the
mother
was
a
harder
judge
than
eve
the
sister
when
she
heard
of
the
bills
she
looked
upon
lucien
as
lost
a
mother
is
often
fain
to
shut
her
eyes
but
she
always
knows
the
child
that
she
held
at
her
breast
the
child
that
has
been
always
with
her
in
the
house
and
so
when
eve
and
david
discussed
lucien
s
chances
of
success
in
paris
and
lucien
s
mother
to
all
appearance
shared
eve
s
illusions
in
her
inmost
heart
there
was
a
tremor
of
fear
lest
david
should
be
right
for
a
mother
s
consciousness
bore
a
witness
to
the
truth
of
his
words
so
well
did
she
know
eve
s
sensitive
nature
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
her
fears
she
was
obliged
to
choke
them
down
and
keep
such
silence
as
mothers
alone
can
keep
when
they
know
how
to
love
their
children
and
eve
on
her
side
had
watched
her
mother
and
saw
the
ravages
of
hidden
grief
with
a
feeling
of
dread
her
mother
was
not
growing
old
she
was
failing
from
day
to
day
mother
and
daughter
lived
a
live
of
generous
deception
and
neither
was
deceived
the
brutal
old
vinegrower
s
speech
was
the
last
drop
that
filled
the
cup
of
affliction
to
overflowing
the
words
struck
a
chill
to
mme
chardon
s
heart
here
is
my
mother
monsieur
said
eve
and
the
abbe
looking
up
saw
a
woman
with
a
face
as
thin
and
worn
as
the
features
of
some
aged
nun
and
yet
grown
beautiful
with
the
calm
and
sweet
expression
that
devout
submission
gives
to
the
faces
of
women
who
walk
by
the
will
of
god
as
the
saying
is
then
the
abbe
understood
the
lives
of
the
mother
and
daughter
and
had
no
more
sympathy
left
for
lucien
he
shuddered
to
think
of
all
that
the
victims
had
endured
mother
said
eve
drying
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
poor
lucien
is
not
very
far
away
he
is
at
and
why
is
he
not
here
asked
mme
chardon
then
the
abbe
told
the
whole
story
as
lucien
had
told
it
to
him
the
misery
of
the
journey
the
troubles
of
the
last
days
in
paris
he
described
the
poet
s
agony
of
mind
when
he
heard
of
the
havoc
wrought
at
home
by
his
imprudence
and
his
apprehension
as
to
the
reception
awaiting
him
at
angouleme
he
has
doubts
of
us
has
it
come
to
this
said
mme
chardon
the
unhappy
young
man
has
come
back
to
you
on
foot
enduring
the
most
terrible
hardships
by
the
way
he
is
prepared
to
enter
the
humblest
walks
in
life
if
so
he
may
make
monsieur
lucien
s
sister
said
in
spite
of
the
wrong
he
has
done
us
i
love
my
brother
still
as
we
love
the
dead
body
when
the
soul
has
left
it
and
even
so
i
love
him
more
than
many
sisters
love
their
brothers
he
has
made
us
poor
indeed
but
let
him
come
to
us
he
shall
share
the
last
crust
of
bread
anything
indeed
that
he
has
left
us
oh
if
he
had
never
left
us
monsieur
we
should
not
have
lost
our
heart
s
and
the
woman
who
took
him
from
us
brought
him
back
on
her
carriage
exclaimed
mme
chardon
he
went
away
sitting
by
mme
de
bargeton
s
side
in
her
caleche
and
he
came
back
behind
can
i
do
anything
for
you
asked
the
good
cure
seeking
an
opportunity
to
take
leave
a
wound
in
the
purse
is
not
fatal
they
say
monsieur
said
mme
chardon
but
the
patient
must
be
his
own
if
you
have
sufficient
influence
with
my
to
induce
him
to
help
his
son
you
would
save
a
whole
family
said
eve
he
has
no
belief
in
you
and
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
much
exasperated
against
your
husband
answered
the
old
cure
he
retained
an
impression
from
the
s
rambling
talk
that
the
sechards
affairs
were
a
kind
of
wasps
nest
with
which
it
was
imprudent
to
meddle
and
his
mission
being
fulfilled
he
went
to
dine
with
his
nephew
postel
that
worthy
like
the
rest
of
angouleme
maintained
that
the
father
was
in
the
right
and
soon
dissipated
any
little
benevolence
that
the
old
gentleman
was
disposed
to
feel
towards
the
son
and
his
family
with
those
that
squander
money
something
may
be
done
concluded
little
postel
but
those
that
make
experiments
are
the
ruin
of
the
cure
went
home
his
curiosity
was
thoroughly
satisfied
and
this
is
the
end
and
object
of
the
exceeding
interest
taken
in
other
people
s
business
in
the
provinces
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
poet
was
duly
informed
of
all
that
had
passed
in
the
sechard
family
and
the
journey
was
represented
as
a
pilgrimage
undertaken
from
motives
of
the
purest
charity
you
have
run
your
and
sister
into
debt
to
the
amount
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
said
the
abbe
as
he
drew
to
an
end
and
nobody
hereabouts
has
that
trifling
amount
to
lend
a
neighbor
my
dear
sir
we
are
not
rich
in
angoumois
when
you
spoke
to
me
of
your
bills
i
thought
that
a
much
smaller
amount
was
lucien
thanked
the
old
man
for
his
good
offices
the
promise
of
forgiveness
which
you
have
brought
is
for
me
a
priceless
very
early
the
next
morning
lucien
set
out
from
marsac
and
reached
angouleme
towards
nine
o
clock
he
carried
nothing
but
his
the
short
jacket
that
he
wore
was
considerably
the
worst
for
his
journey
his
black
trousers
were
whitened
with
dust
and
a
pair
of
worn
boots
told
sufficiently
plainly
that
their
owner
belonged
to
the
hapless
tribe
of
tramps
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
contrast
between
his
departure
and
return
was
bound
to
strike
his
he
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
from
himself
but
just
then
with
his
heart
swelling
beneath
the
oppression
of
remorse
awakened
in
him
by
the
old
cure
s
story
he
accepted
his
punishment
for
the
moment
and
made
up
his
mind
to
brave
the
eyes
of
his
acquaintances
within
himself
he
said
i
am
behaving
poetic
temperaments
of
this
stamp
begin
as
their
own
dupes
he
walked
up
through
l
houmeau
shame
at
the
manner
of
his
return
struggling
with
the
charm
of
old
associations
as
he
went
his
heart
beat
quickly
as
he
passed
postel
s
shop
but
very
luckily
for
him
the
only
persons
inside
it
were
leonie
and
her
child
and
yet
vanity
was
still
so
strong
in
him
that
he
could
feel
glad
that
his
father
s
name
had
been
painted
out
on
the
for
postel
since
his
marriage
had
redecorated
his
abode
and
the
word
pharmacy
now
alone
appeared
there
in
the
paris
fashion
in
big
letters
when
lucien
reached
the
steps
by
the
palet
gate
he
felt
the
influence
of
his
native
air
his
misfortunes
no
longer
weighed
upon
him
i
shall
see
them
again
he
said
to
himself
with
a
thrill
of
delight
he
reached
the
place
du
murier
and
had
not
met
a
soul
a
piece
of
luck
that
he
scarcely
hoped
for
he
who
once
had
gone
about
his
native
place
with
a
conqueror
s
air
marion
and
kolb
on
guard
at
the
door
flew
out
upon
the
steps
crying
out
here
he
is
lucien
saw
the
familiar
workshop
and
courtyard
and
on
the
staircase
met
his
mother
and
sister
and
for
a
moment
while
their
arms
were
about
him
all
three
almost
forgot
their
troubles
in
family
life
we
almost
always
compound
with
our
misfortunes
we
make
a
sort
of
bed
to
rest
upon
and
if
it
is
hard
hope
to
make
it
tolerable
if
lucien
looked
the
picture
of
despair
poetic
charm
was
not
wanting
to
the
picture
his
face
had
been
tanned
by
the
sunlight
of
the
open
road
and
the
deep
sadness
visible
in
his
features
overshadowed
his
poet
s
brow
the
change
in
him
told
so
plainly
of
sufferings
endured
his
face
was
so
worn
by
sharp
misery
that
no
one
could
help
pitying
him
imagination
had
fared
forth
into
the
world
and
found
sad
reality
at
the
eve
was
smiling
in
the
midst
of
her
joy
as
the
saints
smile
upon
martyrdom
the
face
of
a
young
and
very
fair
woman
grows
sublimely
beautiful
at
the
touch
of
grief
lucien
remembered
the
innocent
girlish
face
that
he
saw
last
before
he
went
to
paris
and
the
look
of
gravity
that
had
come
over
it
spoke
so
eloquently
that
he
could
not
but
feel
a
painful
impression
the
first
quick
natural
outpouring
of
affection
was
followed
at
once
by
a
reaction
on
either
side
they
were
afraid
to
speak
and
when
lucien
almost
involuntarily
looked
round
for
another
who
should
have
been
there
eve
burst
into
tears
and
lucien
did
the
same
but
mme
chardon
s
haggard
face
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
eve
rose
to
her
feet
and
went
downstairs
partly
to
spare
her
brother
a
word
of
reproach
partly
to
speak
to
marion
lucien
is
so
fond
of
strawberries
child
we
must
find
some
strawberries
for
oh
i
was
sure
that
you
would
want
to
welcome
lucien
you
shall
have
a
nice
little
breakfast
and
a
good
dinner
lucien
said
mme
chardon
when
the
mother
and
son
were
left
alone
you
have
a
great
deal
to
repair
here
you
went
away
that
we
all
might
be
proud
of
you
you
have
plunged
us
into
want
you
have
all
but
destroyed
your
brother
s
opportunity
of
making
a
fortune
that
he
only
cared
to
win
for
the
sake
of
his
new
family
nor
is
this
all
that
you
have
destroyed
said
the
mother
there
was
a
dreadful
pause
lucien
took
his
mother
s
reproaches
in
silence
now
begin
to
work
mme
chardon
went
on
more
gently
you
tried
to
revive
the
noble
family
of
whom
i
come
i
do
not
blame
you
for
it
but
the
man
who
undertakes
such
a
task
needs
money
above
all
things
and
must
bear
a
high
heart
in
him
both
were
wanting
in
your
case
we
believed
in
you
once
our
belief
has
been
shaken
this
was
a
contented
household
making
its
way
with
difficulty
you
have
troubled
their
peace
the
first
offence
may
be
forgiven
but
it
must
be
the
last
we
are
in
a
very
difficult
position
here
you
must
be
careful
and
take
your
sister
s
advice
lucien
the
school
of
trouble
is
a
very
hard
one
but
eve
has
learned
much
by
her
lessons
she
has
grown
grave
and
thoughtful
she
is
a
mother
in
her
devotion
to
our
dear
david
she
has
taken
all
the
family
burdens
upon
herself
indeed
through
your
wrongdoing
she
has
come
to
be
my
only
you
might
be
still
more
severe
my
mother
lucien
said
as
he
kissed
her
i
accept
your
forgiveness
for
i
will
not
need
it
a
second
eve
came
into
the
room
saw
her
brother
s
humble
attitude
and
knew
that
he
had
been
forgiven
her
kindness
brought
a
smile
for
him
to
her
lips
and
lucien
answered
with
eyes
a
living
presence
acts
like
a
charm
changing
the
most
hostile
positions
of
lovers
or
of
families
no
matter
how
just
the
resentment
is
it
that
affection
finds
out
the
ways
of
the
heart
and
we
love
to
fall
into
them
again
does
the
phenomenon
come
within
the
province
of
the
science
of
magnetism
or
is
it
reason
that
tells
us
that
we
must
either
forgive
or
never
see
each
other
again
whether
the
cause
be
referred
to
mental
physical
or
spiritual
conditions
everyone
knows
the
effect
every
one
has
felt
that
the
looks
the
actions
or
gestures
of
the
beloved
awaken
some
vestige
of
tenderness
in
those
most
deeply
sinned
against
and
grievously
wronged
though
it
is
hard
for
the
mind
to
forget
though
we
still
smart
under
the
injury
the
heart
returns
to
its
allegiance
in
spite
of
all
poor
eve
listened
to
her
brother
s
confidences
until
and
whenever
she
looked
at
him
she
was
no
longer
mistress
of
her
eyes
in
that
intimate
talk
she
could
not
control
her
voice
and
with
the
comprehension
of
the
conditions
of
literary
life
in
paris
she
understood
that
the
struggle
had
been
too
much
for
lucien
s
strength
the
poet
s
delight
as
he
caressed
his
sister
s
child
his
deep
grief
over
david
s
absence
mingled
with
joy
at
seeing
his
country
and
his
own
folk
again
the
melancholy
words
that
he
let
fall
all
these
things
combined
to
make
that
day
a
festival
when
marion
brought
in
the
strawberries
he
was
touched
to
see
that
eve
had
remembered
his
taste
in
spite
of
her
distress
and
she
his
sister
must
make
ready
a
room
for
the
prodigal
brother
and
busy
herself
for
lucien
it
was
a
truce
as
it
were
to
misery
old
sechard
himself
assisted
to
bring
about
this
revulsion
of
feeling
in
the
two
women
you
are
making
as
much
of
him
as
if
he
were
bringing
you
any
amount
of
money
and
what
has
my
brother
done
that
we
should
not
make
much
of
him
cried
eve
jealously
screening
lucien
nevertheless
when
the
first
expansion
was
over
shades
of
truth
came
out
it
was
not
long
before
lucien
felt
the
difference
between
the
old
affection
and
the
new
eve
respected
david
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
lucien
was
beloved
for
his
own
sake
as
we
love
a
mistress
still
in
spite
of
the
disasters
she
causes
esteem
the
very
foundation
on
which
affection
is
based
is
the
solid
stuff
to
which
affection
owes
i
know
not
what
of
certainty
and
security
by
which
we
live
and
this
was
lacking
between
mme
chardon
and
her
son
between
the
sister
and
the
brother
mother
and
daughter
did
not
put
entire
confidence
in
him
as
they
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
lost
his
honor
and
he
felt
this
the
opinion
expressed
in
d
arthez
s
letter
was
eve
s
own
estimate
of
her
brother
unconsciously
she
revealed
it
by
her
manner
tones
and
gestures
oh
lucien
was
pitied
that
was
true
but
as
for
all
that
he
had
been
the
pride
of
the
household
the
great
man
of
the
family
the
hero
of
the
fireside
all
this
like
their
fair
hopes
of
him
was
gone
never
to
return
they
were
so
afraid
of
his
heedlessness
that
he
was
not
told
where
david
was
hidden
lucien
wanted
to
see
his
brother
but
this
eve
insensible
to
the
caresses
which
accompanied
his
curious
questionings
was
not
the
eve
of
l
houmeau
for
whom
a
glance
from
him
had
been
an
order
that
must
be
obeyed
when
lucien
spoke
of
making
reparation
and
talked
as
though
he
could
rescue
david
eve
only
answered
do
not
interfere
we
have
enemies
of
the
most
treacherous
and
dangerous
lucien
tossed
his
head
as
one
who
should
say
i
have
measured
myself
against
parisians
and
the
look
in
his
sister
s
eyes
said
unmistakably
yes
but
you
were
nobody
cares
for
me
now
lucien
thought
in
the
home
circle
as
in
the
world
without
success
is
a
the
poet
tried
to
explain
their
lack
of
confidence
in
him
he
had
not
been
at
home
two
days
before
a
feeling
of
vexation
rather
than
of
angry
bitterness
gained
hold
on
him
he
applied
parisian
standards
to
the
quiet
temperate
existence
of
the
provinces
quite
forgetting
that
the
narrow
patient
life
of
the
household
was
the
result
of
his
own
misdoings
they
are
they
can
not
understand
me
he
said
setting
himself
apart
from
his
sister
and
mother
and
david
now
that
they
could
no
longer
be
deceived
as
to
his
real
character
and
his
future
many
troubles
and
shocks
of
fortune
had
quickened
the
intuitive
sense
in
both
the
women
eve
and
mme
chardon
guessed
the
thoughts
in
lucien
s
inmost
soul
they
felt
that
he
misjudged
them
they
saw
him
mentally
isolating
himself
paris
has
changed
him
very
much
they
said
between
themselves
they
were
indeed
reaping
the
harvest
of
egoism
which
they
themselves
had
fostered
it
was
inevitable
but
that
the
leaven
should
work
in
all
three
and
this
most
of
all
in
lucien
because
he
felt
that
he
was
so
heavily
to
blame
as
for
eve
she
was
just
the
kind
of
sister
to
beg
an
erring
brother
to
forgive
me
for
your
trespasses
but
when
the
union
of
two
souls
had
been
as
perfect
since
life
s
very
beginnings
as
it
had
been
with
eve
and
lucien
any
blow
dealt
to
that
fair
ideal
is
fatal
scoundrels
can
draw
knives
on
each
other
and
make
it
up
again
afterwards
while
a
look
or
a
word
is
enough
to
sunder
two
lovers
for
ever
in
the
recollection
of
an
almost
perfect
life
of
heart
and
heart
lies
the
secret
of
many
an
estrangement
that
none
can
explain
two
may
live
together
without
full
trust
in
their
hearts
if
only
their
past
holds
no
memories
of
complete
and
unclouded
love
but
for
those
who
once
have
known
that
intimate
life
it
becomes
intolerable
to
keep
perpetual
watch
over
looks
and
words
great
poets
know
this
paul
and
virginie
die
before
youth
is
over
can
we
think
of
paul
and
virginie
estranged
let
us
know
that
to
the
honor
of
lucien
and
eve
the
grave
injury
done
was
not
the
source
of
the
pain
it
was
entirely
a
matter
of
feeling
upon
either
side
for
the
poet
in
fault
as
for
the
sister
who
was
in
no
way
to
blame
things
had
reached
the
point
when
the
slightest
misunderstanding
or
little
quarrel
or
a
fresh
disappointment
in
lucien
would
end
in
final
estrangement
money
difficulties
may
be
arranged
but
feelings
are
inexorable
next
day
lucien
received
a
copy
of
the
local
paper
he
turned
pale
with
pleasure
when
he
saw
his
name
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
first
leaders
in
that
highly
respectable
sheet
which
like
the
provincial
academies
that
voltaire
compared
to
a
miss
was
never
talked
about
let
boast
of
giving
the
light
to
victor
hugo
to
charles
nodier
and
cuvier
ran
the
article
brittany
of
producing
a
chateaubriand
and
a
lammenais
normandy
of
casimir
delavigne
and
touraine
of
the
author
of
angoumois
that
gave
birth
in
the
days
of
louis
to
our
illustrious
guez
better
known
under
the
name
of
balzac
our
angoumois
need
no
longer
envy
limousin
her
dupuytren
nor
auvergne
the
country
of
montlosier
nor
bordeaux
birthplace
of
so
many
great
men
for
we
too
have
our
poet
the
writer
of
the
beautiful
sonnets
entitled
the
unites
his
poet
s
fame
to
the
distinction
of
a
prose
writer
for
to
him
we
also
owe
the
magnificent
romance
of
archer
of
charles
some
day
our
nephews
will
be
proud
to
be
the
of
lucien
chardon
a
rival
of
petrarch
the
country
newspapers
of
those
days
were
sown
with
notes
of
admiration
as
reports
of
english
election
speeches
are
studded
with
cheers
in
brackets
in
spite
of
his
brilliant
success
in
paris
our
young
poet
has
not
forgotten
the
hotel
de
bargeton
the
cradle
of
his
triumphs
nor
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
le
comte
du
chatelet
our
prefect
encouraged
his
early
footsteps
in
the
pathway
of
the
muses
he
has
come
back
among
us
once
more
all
l
houmeau
was
thrown
into
excitement
yesterday
by
the
appearance
of
our
lucien
de
rubempre
the
news
of
his
return
produced
a
profound
sensation
throughout
the
town
angouleme
certainly
will
not
allow
l
houmeau
to
be
beforehand
in
doing
honor
to
the
poet
who
in
journalism
and
literature
has
so
gloriously
represented
our
town
in
paris
lucien
de
rubempre
a
religious
and
royalist
poet
has
braved
the
fury
of
parties
he
has
come
home
it
is
said
for
repose
after
the
fatigue
of
a
struggle
which
would
try
the
strength
of
an
even
greater
intellectual
athlete
than
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
there
is
some
talk
of
restoring
our
great
poet
to
the
title
of
the
illustrious
house
of
de
rubempre
of
which
his
mother
madame
chardon
is
the
last
survivor
and
it
is
added
that
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
was
the
first
to
think
of
this
eminently
politic
idea
the
revival
of
an
ancient
and
almost
extinct
family
by
young
talent
and
newly
won
fame
is
another
proof
that
the
immortal
author
of
the
charter
still
cherishes
the
desire
expressed
by
the
words
union
and
our
poet
is
staying
with
his
sister
mme
under
the
heading
angouleme
followed
some
items
of
news
our
prefect
le
comte
du
chatelet
gentleman
in
ordinary
to
his
majesty
has
just
been
appointed
extraordinary
councillor
of
state
all
the
authorities
called
yesterday
on
le
prefet
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
will
receive
on
thursdays
the
mayor
of
escarbas
de
negrepelisse
the
representative
of
the
younger
branch
of
the
d
espard
family
and
father
of
mme
du
chatelet
recently
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
count
and
peer
of
france
and
a
commander
of
the
royal
order
of
louis
has
been
nominated
for
the
presidency
of
the
electoral
college
of
angouleme
at
the
forthcoming
there
said
lucien
taking
the
paper
to
his
sister
eve
read
the
article
with
attention
and
returned
with
the
sheet
with
a
thoughtful
air
what
do
you
say
to
that
asked
he
surprised
at
a
reserve
that
seemed
so
like
indifference
the
cointets
are
proprietors
of
that
paper
dear
she
said
they
put
in
exactly
what
they
please
and
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
the
prefecture
or
the
palace
have
forced
their
hands
can
you
imagine
that
your
old
rival
the
prefect
would
be
generous
enough
to
sing
your
praises
have
you
forgotten
that
the
cointets
are
suing
us
under
metivier
s
name
and
that
they
are
trying
to
turn
david
s
discovery
to
their
own
advantage
i
do
not
know
the
source
of
this
paragraph
but
it
makes
me
uneasy
you
used
to
rouse
nothing
but
envious
feeling
and
hatred
here
a
prophet
has
no
honor
in
his
own
country
and
they
slandered
you
and
now
in
a
moment
it
is
all
changed
you
do
not
know
the
vanity
of
country
towns
said
lucien
a
whole
little
town
in
the
south
turned
out
not
so
long
ago
to
welcome
a
young
man
that
had
won
the
first
prize
in
some
competition
they
looked
on
him
as
a
budding
great
listen
dear
lucien
i
do
not
want
to
preach
to
you
i
will
say
everything
in
a
very
few
words
you
must
suspect
every
little
thing
you
are
right
said
lucien
but
he
was
surprised
at
his
sister
s
lack
of
enthusiasm
he
himself
was
full
of
delight
to
find
his
humiliating
and
return
to
angouleme
changed
into
a
triumph
in
this
way
you
have
no
belief
in
the
little
fame
that
has
cost
so
dear
he
said
again
after
a
long
silence
something
like
a
storm
had
been
gathering
in
his
heart
during
the
past
hour
for
all
answer
eve
gave
him
a
look
and
lucien
felt
ashamed
of
his
accusation
dinner
was
scarcely
over
when
a
messenger
came
from
the
prefecture
with
a
note
addressed
to
chardon
that
note
appeared
to
decide
the
day
for
the
poet
s
vanity
the
world
contending
against
the
family
for
him
had
won
m
le
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
and
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
request
the
honor
of
lucien
chardon
s
company
at
dinner
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
enclosed
with
the
invitation
there
was
a
card
le
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
prefect
of
the
charente
councillor
of
state
you
are
in
favor
said
old
sechard
they
are
talking
about
you
in
the
town
as
if
you
were
somebody
angouleme
and
l
houmeau
are
disputing
as
to
which
shall
twist
wreaths
for
eve
dear
lucien
whispered
to
his
sister
i
am
exactly
in
the
same
condition
as
i
was
before
in
l
houmeau
when
mme
de
bargeton
sent
me
the
first
invitation
i
have
not
a
dress
suit
for
the
prefect
s
do
you
really
mean
to
accept
the
invitation
eve
asked
in
alarm
and
a
dispute
sprang
up
between
the
brother
and
sister
eve
s
provincial
good
sense
told
her
that
if
you
appear
in
society
it
must
be
with
a
smiling
face
and
faultless
costume
what
will
come
of
the
prefect
s
dinner
she
wondered
what
has
lucien
to
do
with
the
great
people
of
angouleme
are
they
plotting
something
against
him
but
she
kept
these
thoughts
to
herself
lucien
spoke
the
last
word
at
bedtime
you
do
not
know
my
influence
the
prefect
s
wife
stands
in
fear
of
a
journalist
and
besides
louise
de
negrepelisse
lives
on
in
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
a
woman
with
her
influence
can
rescue
david
i
am
going
to
tell
her
about
my
brother
s
invention
and
it
would
be
a
mere
nothing
to
her
to
obtain
a
subsidy
of
ten
thousand
francs
from
the
government
for
at
eleven
o
clock
that
night
the
whole
household
was
awakened
by
the
town
band
reinforced
by
the
military
band
from
the
barracks
the
place
du
murier
was
full
of
people
the
young
men
of
angouleme
were
giving
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
a
serenade
lucien
went
to
his
sister
s
window
and
made
a
speech
after
the
last
performance
i
thank
my
for
the
honor
that
they
do
me
he
said
in
the
midst
of
a
great
silence
i
will
strive
to
be
worthy
of
it
they
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
no
more
i
am
so
much
moved
by
this
incident
that
i
can
not
hurrah
for
the
writer
of
archer
of
charles
hurrah
for
the
poet
of
the
long
live
lucien
de
rubempre
after
these
three
salvos
taken
up
by
some
few
voices
three
crowns
and
a
quantity
of
bouquets
were
adroitly
flung
into
the
room
through
the
open
window
ten
minutes
later
the
place
du
murier
was
empty
and
silence
prevailed
in
the
streets
i
would
rather
have
ten
thousand
francs
said
old
sechard
fingering
the
bouquets
and
garlands
with
a
satirical
expression
you
gave
them
daisies
and
they
give
you
posies
in
return
you
deal
in
so
that
is
your
opinion
of
the
honors
shown
me
by
my
is
it
asked
lucien
all
his
melancholy
had
left
him
his
face
was
radiant
with
good
humor
if
you
knew
mankind
papa
sechard
you
would
see
that
no
moment
in
one
s
life
comes
twice
such
a
triumph
as
this
can
only
be
due
to
genuine
enthusiasm
my
dear
mother
my
good
sister
this
wipes
out
many
lucien
kissed
them
for
when
joy
overflows
like
a
torrent
flood
we
are
fain
to
pour
it
out
into
a
friend
s
heart
when
an
author
is
intoxicated
with
success
he
will
hug
his
porter
if
there
is
nobody
else
on
hand
according
to
bixiou
why
darling
why
are
you
crying
he
said
looking
into
eve
s
face
ah
i
know
you
are
crying
for
joy
oh
me
said
her
mother
shaking
her
head
as
she
spoke
lucien
has
forgotten
everything
already
not
merely
his
own
troubles
but
ours
as
mother
and
daughter
separated
and
neither
dared
to
utter
all
her
thoughts
in
a
country
eaten
up
with
the
kind
of
social
insubordination
disguised
by
the
word
equality
a
triumph
of
any
kind
whatsoever
is
a
sort
of
miracle
which

offered
to
ten
living
men
selected
for
this

by
a
grateful
country
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
nine
are
given
from
considerations
connected
as
remotely
as
possible
with
the
conspicuous
merits
of
the

what
was

apotheosis
at

the
triumph
of

a

means
that
everybody
else
feels
that
he
is
adorning
his

with

crown
that
he
sets
on
the
idol
s
head
the

proved
correct
the
distinguished
provincial

reception
was
antipathetic
to

immobility
it
was
too
evidently
got
up
by
some
interested
persons
or
by
enthusiastic
stage
mechanics
a
suspicious
combination
eve
moreover
like
most
of
her
sex
was
distrustful
by
instinct
even
when
reason
failed
to
justify
her
suspicions
to
herself
who
can
be
so
fond
of
lucien
that
he
could
rouse
the
town
for
him
she
wondered
as
she
fell
asleep
the

on

the

evening
of
the
day
that
brought
the
cure
of
marsac
to
angouleme
with
the
news
of
lucien
s
return
that
same
evening
he
made
formal
application
for
the
hand
of
mlle
de

it
was
a
family
dinner
one
of
the
solemn
occasions
marked
not
so
much
by
the
number
of
the
guests
as
by
the
splendor
of
their
toilettes
consciousness
of
the
performance
weighs
upon
the

party
and
every

significant
francoise
was
on
exhibition
mme
de
senonches
had
sported
her
most
elaborate
costume
for
the
occasion
du
hautoy
wore
a
black
coat
de
senonches
had
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
pimentels
on
the
receipt
of
a
note
from
his
wife
informing
him
that
mme
du
chatelet
was
to
appear
at
their
house
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
and
that
a
suitor
in
form
for
francoise
would
appear
on
the
scenes
boniface
cointet
also
was
there
in
his
best
maroon
coat
of
clerical
cut
with
a
diamond
pin
worth
six
thousand
francs
displayed
in
his
shirt
frill
the
revenge
of
the
rich
merchant
upon
a
aristocracy
himself
scoured
and
combed
had
carefully
removed
his
gray
hairs
but
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
his
wizened
air
the
puny
little
man
of
law
tightly
buttoned
into
his
clothes
reminded
you
of
a
torpid
viper
for
if
hope
had
brought
a
spark
of
life
into
his
magpie
eyes
his
face
was
icily
rigid
and
so
well
did
he
assume
an
air
of
gravity
that
an
ambitious
public
prosecutor
could
not
have
been
more
dignified
mme
de
senonches
had
told
her
intimate
friends
that
her
ward
would
meet
her
betrothed
that
evening
and
that
mme
du
chatelet
would
appear
at
the
hotel
de
senonches
for
the
first
time
and
having
particularly
requested
them
to
keep
these
matters
secret
she
expected
to
find
her
rooms
crowded
the
comte
and
comtesse
du
chatelet
had
left
cards
everywhere
officially
but
they
meant
the
honor
of
a
personal
visit
to
play
a
part
in
their
policy
so
aristocratic
angouleme
was
in
such
a
prodigious
ferment
of
curiosity
that
certain
of
the
chandour
camp
proposed
to
go
to
the
hotel
de
bargeton
that
evening
they
persistently
declined
to
call
the
house
by
its
new
name
proofs
of
the
countess
influence
had
stirred
up
ambition
in
many
quarters
and
not
only
so
it
was
said
that
the
lady
had
changed
so
much
for
the
better
that
everybody
wished
to
see
and
judge
for
himself
learned
great
news
on
the
way
to
the
house
cointet
told
him
that
zephirine
had
asked
leave
to
present
her
dear
francoise
s
betrothed
to
the
countess
and
that
the
countess
had
granted
the
favor
had
seen
at
once
that
lucien
s
return
put
louise
de
negrepelisse
in
a
false
position
and
now
in
a
moment
he
flattered
himself
that
he
saw
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
mme
de
senonches
had
undertaken
such
heavy
engagements
when
they
bought
the
house
that
in
provincial
fashion
they
thought
it
imprudent
to
make
any
changes
in
it
so
when
madame
du
chatelet
was
announced
zephirine
went
up
to
her
with
look
dear
louise
you
are
still
in
your
old
home
indicating
as
she
spoke
the
little
chandelier
the
paneled
wainscot
and
the
furniture
which
once
had
dazzled
lucien
i
wish
least
of
all
to
remember
it
dear
madame
la
prefete
answered
graciously
looking
round
on
the
assemblage
every
one
admitted
that
louise
de
negrepelisse
was
not
like
the
same
woman
if
the
provincial
had
undergone
a
change
the
woman
herself
had
been
transformed
by
those
eighteen
months
in
paris
by
the
first
happiness
of
a
still
recent
second
marriage
and
the
kind
of
dignity
that
power
confers
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
bore
the
same
resemblance
to
mme
de
bargeton
that
a
girl
of
twenty
bears
to
her
mother
she
wore
a
charming
cap
of
lace
and
flowers
fastened
by
a
pin
the
ringlets
that
half
hid
the
contours
of
her
face
added
to
her
look
of
youth
and
suited
her
style
of
beauty
her
foulard
gown
designed
by
the
celebrated
victorine
with
a
pointed
bodice
exquisitely
fringed
set
off
her
figure
to
advantage
and
a
silken
lace
scarf
adroitly
thrown
about
a
too
long
neck
partly
concealed
her
shoulders
she
played
with
the
dainty
hung
by
a
chain
from
her
bracelet
she
carried
her
fan
and
her
handkerchief
with
ease
pretty
trifles
as
dangerous
as
a
sunken
reef
for
the
provincial
dame
the
refined
taste
shown
in
the
least
details
the
carriage
and
manner
modeled
upon
mme
d
espard
revealed
a
profound
study
of
the
faubourg
as
for
the
elderly
beau
of
the
empire
he
seemed
since
his
marriage
to
have
followed
the
example
of
the
species
of
melon
that
turns
from
green
to
yellow
in
a
night
all
the
youth
that
sixte
had
lost
seemed
to
appear
in
his
wife
s
radiant
countenance
provincial
pleasantries
passed
from
ear
to
ear
circulating
the
more
readily
because
the
women
were
furious
at
the
new
superiority
of
the
sometime
queen
of
angouleme
and
the
persistent
intruder
paid
the
penalty
of
his
wife
s
offence
the
rooms
were
almost
as
full
as
on
that
memorable
evening
of
lucien
s
readings
from
chenier
some
faces
were
missing
de
chandour
and
amelie
de
pimental
and
the
rastignacs
and
de
bargeton
was
no
longer
there
but
the
bishop
came
as
before
with
his
in
his
train
was
much
impressed
by
the
sight
of
the
great
world
of
angouleme
four
months
ago
he
had
no
hope
of
entering
the
circle
he
felt
his
detestation
of
the
classes
sensibly
diminished
he
thought
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
a
most
fascinating
woman
it
is
she
who
can
procure
me
the
appointment
of
deputy
public
prosecutor
he
said
to
himself
louise
chatted
for
an
equal
length
of
time
with
each
of
the
women
her
tone
varied
with
the
importance
of
the
person
addressed
and
the
position
taken
up
by
the
latter
with
regard
to
her
journey
to
paris
with
lucien
the
evening
was
half
over
when
she
withdrew
to
the
boudoir
with
the
bishop
zephirine
came
over
to
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
his
heart
beat
fast
as
his
hostess
brought
him
to
the
room
where
lucien
s
troubles
first
began
and
were
now
about
to
come
to
a
crisis
this
is
dear
i
recommend
him
to
you
the
more
warmly
because
anything
that
you
may
do
for
him
will
doubtless
benefit
my
you
are
an
attorney
are
you
not
monsieur
said
the
august
negrepelisse
scanning
alas
yes
la
the
son
of
the
tailor
in
l
houmeau
had
never
once
had
occasion
to
use
those
three
words
in
his
life
before
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
them
but
it
rests
with
you
madame
la
comtesse
whether
or
no
i
shall
act
for
the
crown
milaud
is
going
to
nevers
it
is
said
but
a
man
is
usually
second
deputy
and
then
first
deputy
is
he
not
broke
in
the
countess
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
the
first
deputy
s
place
at
once
but
i
should
like
first
to
have
some
assurance
of
your
devotion
to
the
cause
of
our
legitimate
sovereigns
to
religion
and
more
especially
to
de
villele
if
i
am
to
interest
myself
on
your
behalf
to
obtain
the
came
nearer
madame
he
said
in
her
ear
i
am
the
man
to
yield
the
king
absolute
that
is
just
what
want
said
the
countess
drawing
back
a
little
to
make
him
understand
that
she
had
no
wish
for
promises
given
under
his
breath
so
long
as
you
satisfy
mme
de
senonches
you
can
count
upon
me
she
added
with
a
royal
movement
of
her
fan
looked
toward
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
saw
cointet
standing
there
madame
he
said
lucien
is
here
in
well
sir
asked
the
countess
in
tones
that
would
have
put
an
end
to
all
power
of
speech
in
an
ordinary
man
mme
la
comtesse
does
not
understand
returned
bringing
out
that
most
respectful
formula
again
how
does
mme
la
comtesse
wish
that
the
great
man
of
her
making
should
be
received
in
angouleme
there
is
no
middle
course
he
must
be
received
or
despised
this
was
a
dilemma
to
which
louise
de
negrepelisse
had
never
given
a
thought
it
touched
her
closely
yet
rather
for
the
sake
of
the
past
than
of
the
future
and
as
for
his
plan
for
arresting
david
sechard
depended
upon
the
lady
s
actual
feelings
towards
lucien
he
waited
m
said
the
countess
with
haughty
dignity
you
mean
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
government
learn
that
the
first
principle
of
government
is
this
never
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
and
that
the
instinct
of
power
and
the
sense
of
dignity
is
even
stronger
in
women
than
in
that
is
just
what
i
thought
madame
he
answered
quickly
observing
the
countess
meanwhile
with
attention
the
more
profound
because
it
was
scarcely
visible
lucien
came
here
in
the
depths
of
misery
but
if
he
must
receive
an
ovation
i
can
compel
him
to
leave
angouleme
by
the
means
of
the
ovation
itself
his
sister
and
david
sechard
are
hard
pressed
for
in
the
countess
haughty
face
there
was
a
swift
barely
perceptible
change
it
was
not
satisfaction
but
the
repression
of
satisfaction
surprised
that
should
have
guessed
her
wishes
she
gave
him
a
glance
as
she
opened
her
fan
and
francoise
de
la
haye
s
entrance
at
that
moment
gave
her
time
to
find
an
answer
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
are
public
prosecutor
monsieur
she
said
with
a
significant
smile
that
speech
did
not
commit
her
in
any
way
but
it
was
explicit
enough
francoise
had
come
in
to
thank
the
countess
oh
madame
then
i
shall
owe
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
you
she
exclaimed
bending
girlishly
to
add
in
the
countess
ear
to
marry
a
petty
provincial
attorney
would
be
like
being
burned
by
slow
it
was
francis
with
his
knowledge
of
officialdom
who
had
prompted
zephirine
to
make
this
set
upon
louise
in
the
very
earliest
days
after
promotion
so
the
told
his
fair
friend
everybody
prefect
or
monarch
or
man
of
business
is
burning
to
exert
his
influence
for
his
friends
but
a
patron
soon
finds
out
the
inconveniences
of
patronage
and
then
turns
from
fire
to
ice
louise
will
do
more
now
for
than
she
would
do
for
her
husband
in
three
months
madame
la
comtesse
is
thinking
of
all
that
our
poet
s
triumph
entails
continued
she
should
receive
lucien
before
there
is
an
end
of
the
the
countess
terminated
the
audience
with
a
bow
and
rose
to
speak
with
mme
de
pimentel
who
came
to
the
boudoir
the
news
of
old
negrepelisse
s
elevation
to
a
marquisate
had
greatly
impressed
the
marquise
she
judged
it
expedient
to
be
amiable
to
a
woman
so
clever
as
to
rise
the
higher
for
an
apparent
fall
do
tell
me
dear
why
you
took
the
trouble
to
put
your
father
in
the
house
of
peers
said
the
marquise
in
the
course
of
a
little
confidential
conversation
in
which
she
bent
the
knee
before
the
superiority
of
her
dear
they
were
all
the
more
ready
to
grant
the
favor
because
my
father
has
no
son
to
succeed
him
dear
and
his
vote
will
always
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
crown
but
if
we
should
have
sons
i
quite
expect
that
my
oldest
will
succeed
to
his
grandfather
s
name
title
and
mme
de
pimentel
saw
to
her
annoyance
that
it
was
idle
to
expect
a
mother
ambitious
for
children
not
yet
in
existence
to
further
her
own
private
designs
of
raising
de
pimentel
to
a
peerage
i
have
the
countess
told
cointet
when
they
came
away
i
can
promise
you
your
partnership
i
shall
be
deputy
prosecutor
before
the
month
is
out
and
sechard
will
be
in
your
power
try
to
find
a
buyer
for
my
connection
it
has
come
to
be
the
first
in
angouleme
in
my
hands
during
the
last
five
months
once
put
on
the
horse
and
there
is
no
need
to
do
more
said
cointet
half
jealous
of
his
own
work
the
causes
of
lucien
s
triumphant
reception
in
his
native
town
must
now
be
plain
to
everybody
louise
du
chatelet
followed
the
example
of
that
king
of
france
who
left
the
duke
of
orleans
unavenged
she
chose
to
forget
the
insults
received
in
paris
by
mme
de
bargeton
she
would
patronize
lucien
and
overwhelming
him
with
her
patronage
would
completely
crush
him
and
get
rid
of
him
by
fair
means
knew
the
whole
tale
of
the
cabals
in
paris
through
town
gossip
and
shrewdly
guessed
how
a
woman
must
hate
the
man
who
would
not
love
when
she
was
fain
of
his
love
the
ovation
justified
the
past
of
louise
de
negrepelisse
the
next
day
appeared
at
mme
sechard
s
house
heading
a
deputation
of
six
young
men
of
the
town
all
of
them
lucien
s
schoolfellows
he
meant
to
finish
his
work
to
intoxicate
lucien
completely
and
to
have
him
in
his
power
lucien
s
old
schoolfellows
at
the
angouleme
wished
to
invite
the
author
of
the
and
archer
of
charles
to
a
banquet
given
in
honor
of
the
great
man
arisen
from
their
ranks
come
this
is
your
doing
exclaimed
lucien
your
return
has
stirred
our
conceit
said
we
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
get
up
a
subscription
and
we
will
have
a
tremendous
affair
for
you
the
masters
and
the
headmaster
will
be
there
and
at
the
present
rate
we
shall
no
doubt
have
the
authorities
for
what
day
asked
lucien
sunday
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
said
lucien
i
can
not
accept
an
invitation
for
the
next
ten
days
but
then
i
will
gladly
very
well
said
so
be
it
then
in
ten
days
lucien
behaved
charmingly
to
his
old
schoolfellows
and
they
regarded
him
with
almost
respectful
admiration
he
talked
away
very
wittily
for
half
an
hour
he
had
been
set
upon
a
pedestal
and
wished
to
justify
the
opinion
of
his
so
he
stood
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
held
forth
from
the
height
to
which
he
had
been
raised
he
was
modest
and
as
befitted
genius
in
and
slippers
he
was
the
athlete
wearied
by
a
wrestling
bout
with
paris
and
disenchanted
above
all
things
he
congratulated
the
comrades
who
had
never
left
the
dear
old
province
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
they
were
delighted
with
him
he
took
aside
and
asked
him
for
the
real
truth
about
david
s
affairs
reproaching
him
for
allowing
his
to
go
into
hiding
and
tried
to
match
his
wits
against
the
little
lawyer
made
an
effort
over
himself
and
gave
his
acquaintance
to
understand
that
he
was
only
an
insignificant
little
country
attorney
with
no
sort
of
craft
nor
subtlety
the
whole
machinery
of
modern
society
is
so
infinitely
more
complex
than
in
ancient
times
that
the
subdivision
of
human
faculty
is
the
result
the
great
men
of
the
days
of
old
were
perforce
universal
geniuses
appearing
at
rare
intervals
like
lighted
torches
in
an
antique
world
in
the
course
of
ages
the
intellect
began
to
work
on
special
lines
but
the
great
man
still
could
take
all
knowledge
for
his
a
man
full
cautelous
as
was
said
of
louis
for
instance
could
apply
that
special
faculty
in
every
direction
but
the
single
quality
is
subdivided
and
every
profession
has
its
special
craft
a
peasant
or
a
pettifogging
solicitor
might
very
easily
overreach
an
astute
diplomate
over
a
bargain
in
some
remote
country
village
and
the
wiliest
journalist
may
prove
the
veriest
simpleton
in
a
piece
of
business
lucien
could
but
be
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
that
guileful
practitioner
as
might
have
been
expected
had
written
the
article
himself
angouleme
and
l
houmeau
thus
put
on
their
mettle
thought
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
pay
honor
to
lucien
his
assembled
in
the
place
du
murier
were
cointets
workpeople
from
the
papermills
and
with
a
sprinkling
of
lucien
s
old
schoolfellows
and
the
clerks
in
the
employ
of
messieurs
and
cachan
as
for
the
attorney
himself
he
was
once
more
lucien
s
chum
of
old
days
and
he
thought
not
without
reason
that
before
very
long
he
should
learn
david
s
whereabouts
in
some
unguarded
moment
and
if
david
came
to
grief
through
lucien
s
fault
the
poet
would
find
angouleme
too
hot
to
hold
him
meant
to
secure
his
hold
he
posed
therefore
as
lucien
s
inferior
what
better
could
i
have
done
he
said
accordingly
my
old
chum
s
sister
was
involved
it
is
true
but
there
are
some
positions
that
simply
can
not
be
maintained
in
a
court
of
law
david
asked
me
on
the
first
of
june
to
ensure
him
a
quiet
life
for
three
months
he
had
a
quiet
life
until
september
and
even
so
i
have
kept
his
property
out
of
his
creditors
power
for
i
shall
gain
my
case
in
the
i
contend
that
the
wife
is
a
privileged
creditor
and
her
claim
is
absolute
unless
there
is
evidence
of
intent
to
defraud
as
for
you
you
have
come
back
in
misfortune
but
you
are
a
lucien
turned
about
as
if
the
incense
were
burned
too
close
to
his
face
yes
my
dear
fellow
a
i
have
read
your
of
charles
it
is
more
than
a
romance
it
is
literature
only
two
living
men
could
have
written
the
preface
chateaubriand
and
lucien
accepted
that
d
arthez
had
written
the
preface
writers
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
done
the
same
well
nobody
here
seemed
to
have
heard
of
you
continued
with
apparent
indignation
when
i
saw
the
general
indifference
i
made
up
my
mind
to
change
all
that
i
wrote
that
article
in
the
paper
what
did
you
write
it
exclaimed
lucien
i
myself
angouleme
and
l
houmeau
were
stirred
to
rivalry
i
arranged
for
a
meeting
of
your
old
schoolfellows
and
got
up
yesterday
s
serenade
and
when
once
the
enthusiasm
began
to
grow
we
started
a
committee
for
the
dinner
if
david
is
in
hiding
said
i
to
myself
lucien
shall
be
crowned
at
any
and
i
have
done
even
better
than
that
continued
i
have
seen
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
made
her
understand
that
she
owes
it
to
herself
to
extricate
david
from
his
position
she
can
do
it
and
she
ought
to
do
it
if
david
had
really
discovered
the
secret
of
which
he
spoke
to
me
the
government
ought
to
lend
him
a
hand
it
would
not
ruin
the
government
and
think
what
a
fine
thing
for
a
prefect
to
have
half
the
credit
of
the
great
invention
for
the
help
it
would
set
people
talking
about
him
as
an
enlightened
your
sister
has
taken
fright
at
our
musketry
practice
she
was
scared
of
the
smoke
a
battle
in
the
costs
quite
as
much
as
a
battle
on
the
field
but
david
has
held
his
ground
he
has
his
secret
they
can
not
stop
him
and
they
will
not
pull
him
up
thanks
my
dear
fellow
i
see
that
i
can
take
you
into
my
confidence
you
shall
help
me
to
carry
out
my
looked
at
lucien
and
his
gimlet
face
was
a
point
of
interrogation
i
intend
to
rescue
sechard
lucien
said
with
a
certain
importance
i
brought
his
misfortunes
upon
him
i
mean
to
make
full
reparation
i
have
more
influence
over
louise
who
is
louise
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
started
i
have
more
influence
over
her
than
she
herself
suspects
said
lucien
only
my
dear
fellow
if
i
can
do
something
with
your
authorities
here
i
have
no
decent
made
as
though
he
would
offer
his
purse
thank
you
said
lucien
grasping
s
hand
in
ten
days
time
i
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
countess
and
return
your
the
shook
hands
like
old
comrades
and
separated
he
ought
to
be
a
poet
said
to
himself
he
is
quite
there
are
no
friends
like
one
s
school
friends
it
is
a
true
saying
lucien
thought
at
he
went
to
find
his
sister
what
can
have
promised
to
do
that
you
should
be
so
friendly
with
him
my
lucien
asked
eve
be
on
your
guard
with
with
cried
lucien
listen
eve
he
continued
seeming
to
bethink
himself
you
have
no
faith
in
me
now
you
do
not
trust
me
so
it
is
not
likely
you
will
trust
but
in
ten
or
twelve
days
you
will
change
your
mind
he
added
with
a
touch
of
fatuity
and
he
went
to
his
room
and
indited
the
following
epistle
to
lousteau
to
my
friend
of
the
pair
of
us
i
alone
can
remember
that
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
that
i
once
lent
you
and
i
know
how
things
will
be
with
you
when
you
open
this
letter
too
well
alas
not
to
add
immediately
that
i
do
not
expect
to
be
repaid
in
current
coin
of
the
realm
no
i
will
take
it
in
credit
from
you
just
as
one
would
ask
florine
for
pleasure
we
have
the
same
tailor
therefore
you
can
order
a
complete
outfit
for
me
on
the
shortest
possible
notice
i
am
not
precisely
wearing
adam
s
costume
but
i
can
not
show
myself
here
to
my
astonishment
the
honors
paid
by
the
departments
to
a
parisian
celebrity
awaited
me
i
am
the
hero
of
a
banquet
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
were
a
deputy
of
the
left
now
after
that
do
you
understand
that
i
must
have
a
black
coat
promise
to
pay
have
it
put
down
to
your
account
try
the
advertisement
dodge
rehearse
an
unpublished
scene
between
don
juan
and
dimanche
for
i
must
have
a
gala
suit
at
all
costs
i
have
nothing
nothing
but
rags
start
with
that
it
is
august
the
weather
is
magnificent
ergo
see
that
i
receive
by
the
end
of
the
week
a
charming
morning
suit
dark
jacket
and
three
waistcoats
one
a
brimstone
yellow
one
a
plaid
and
the
third
must
be
white
furthermore
let
there
be
three
pairs
of
trousers
of
the
most
fetching
kind
one
pair
of
white
english
stuff
one
pair
of
nankeen
and
a
third
of
thin
black
kerseymere
lastly
send
a
black
and
a
black
satin
waistcoat
if
you
have
picked
up
another
florine
somewhere
i
beg
her
good
offices
for
two
cravats
so
far
this
is
nothing
i
count
upon
you
and
your
skill
in
these
matters
i
am
not
much
afraid
of
the
tailor
but
the
ingenuity
of
poverty
assuredly
the
most
active
of
all
poisons
at
work
in
the
system
of
man
the
parisian
an
ingenuity
that
would
catch
satan
himself
napping
has
failed
so
far
to
discover
a
way
to
obtain
a
hat
on
credit
how
many
a
time
my
dear
friend
have
we
deplored
this
when
one
of
us
shall
bring
a
hat
that
costs
one
thousand
francs
into
fashion
then
and
not
till
then
can
we
afford
to
wear
them
until
that
day
comes
we
are
bound
to
have
cash
enough
in
our
pockets
to
pay
for
a
hat
ah
what
an
ill
turn
the
did
us
with
lafleur
you
will
put
gold
in
my
pockets
i
write
with
a
profound
sense
of
all
the
difficulties
involved
by
the
demand
enclose
with
the
above
a
pair
of
boots
a
pair
of
pumps
a
hat
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
gloves
tis
asking
the
impossible
i
know
it
but
what
is
a
literary
life
but
a
periodical
recurrence
of
the
impossible
work
the
miracle
write
a
long
article
or
play
some
small
scurvy
trick
and
i
will
hold
your
debt
as
fully
discharged
this
is
all
i
say
to
you
it
is
a
debt
of
honor
after
all
my
dear
fellow
and
due
these
twelve
months
you
ought
to
blush
for
yourself
if
you
have
any
blushes
left
joking
apart
my
dear
lousteau
i
am
in
serious
difficulties
as
you
may
judge
for
yourself
when
i
tell
you
that
mme
de
bargeton
has
married
chatelet
and
chatelet
is
prefect
of
angouleme
the
precious
pair
can
do
a
good
deal
for
my
he
is
in
hiding
at
this
moment
on
account
of
that
letter
of
exchange
and
the
horrid
business
is
all
my
doing
so
it
is
a
question
of
appearing
before
mme
la
prefete
and
regaining
my
influence
at
all
costs
it
is
shocking
is
it
not
that
david
sechard
s
fate
should
hang
upon
a
neat
pair
of
shoes
a
pair
of
gray
silk
stockings
mind
you
remember
them
and
a
new
hat
i
shall
give
out
that
i
am
sick
and
ill
and
take
to
my
bed
like
duvicquet
to
save
the
trouble
of
replying
to
the
pressing
invitations
of
my
my
dear
boy
have
treated
me
to
a
fine
serenade
forsooth
i
begin
to
wonder
how
many
fools
go
to
make
up
that
word
since
i
learned
that
two
or
three
of
my
old
schoolfellows
worked
up
the
capital
of
the
angoumois
to
this
pitch
of
enthusiasm
if
you
could
contrive
to
slip
a
few
lines
as
to
my
reception
in
among
the
news
items
i
should
be
several
inches
taller
for
it
here
and
besides
i
should
make
mme
la
prefete
feel
that
if
i
have
not
friends
i
have
some
credit
at
any
rate
with
the
parisian
press
i
give
up
none
of
my
hopes
and
i
will
return
the
compliment
if
you
want
a
good
solid
substantial
article
for
some
magazine
or
other
i
have
time
enough
now
to
think
something
out
i
only
say
the
word
my
dear
friend
i
count
upon
you
as
you
may
count
upon
me
and
i
am
yours
sincerely
lucien
de
p
send
the
things
to
the
coach
office
to
wait
until
called
lucien
held
up
his
head
again
in
this
mood
he
wrote
the
letter
and
as
he
wrote
his
thoughts
went
back
to
paris
he
had
spent
six
days
in
the
provinces
and
the
uneventful
quietness
of
provincial
life
had
already
entered
into
his
soul
his
mind
returned
to
those
dear
old
miserable
days
with
a
vague
sense
of
regret
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
filled
his
thoughts
for
a
whole
week
and
at
last
he
came
to
attach
so
much
importance
to
his
reappearance
that
he
hurried
down
to
the
coach
office
in
l
houmeau
after
nightfall
in
a
perfect
agony
of
suspense
like
a
woman
who
has
set
her
last
hopes
upon
a
new
dress
and
waits
in
despair
until
it
arrives
ah
lousteau
all
your
treasons
are
forgiven
he
said
to
himself
as
he
eyed
the
packages
and
knew
from
the
shape
of
them
that
everything
had
been
sent
inside
the
hatbox
he
found
a
note
from
lousteau
florine
s
my
dear
boy
the
tailor
behaved
very
well
but
as
thy
profound
retrospective
glance
led
thee
to
forbode
the
cravats
the
hats
and
the
silk
hosen
perplexed
our
souls
for
there
was
nothing
in
our
purse
to
be
perplexed
thereby
as
said
blondet
so
say
we
there
is
a
fortune
awaiting
the
establishment
which
will
supply
young
men
with
inexpensive
articles
on
credit
for
when
we
do
not
pay
in
the
beginning
we
pay
dear
in
the
end
and
by
the
by
did
not
the
great
napoleon
who
missed
a
voyage
to
the
indies
for
want
of
boots
say
that
if
a
thing
is
easy
it
is
never
done
so
everything
went
well
except
the
boots
i
beheld
a
vision
of
thee
fully
dressed
but
without
a
hat
appareled
in
waistcoats
yet
shoeless
and
bethought
me
of
sending
a
pair
of
moccasins
given
to
florine
as
a
curiosity
by
an
american
florine
offered
the
huge
sum
of
forty
francs
that
we
might
try
our
luck
at
play
for
you
nathan
blondet
and
i
had
such
luck
as
we
were
not
playing
for
ourselves
that
we
were
rich
enough
to
ask
la
torpille
des
lupeaulx
s
sometime
rat
to
supper
frascati
certainly
owed
us
that
much
florine
undertook
the
shopping
and
added
three
fine
shirts
to
the
purchases
nathan
sends
you
a
cane
blondet
who
won
three
hundred
francs
is
sending
you
a
gold
chain
and
the
gold
watch
the
size
of
a
piece
is
from
la
torpille
some
idiot
gave
the
thing
to
her
and
it
will
not
go
trumpery
rubbish
she
says
like
the
man
that
owned
bixiou
who
came
to
find
us
up
at
the
de
wished
to
enclose
a
bottle
of
portugal
water
in
the
package
said
our
first
comic
man
if
this
can
make
him
happy
let
him
have
it
growling
it
out
in
a
deep
bass
voice
with
the
pomposity
that
he
can
act
to
the
life
which
things
my
dear
boy
ought
to
prove
to
you
how
much
we
care
for
our
friends
in
adversity
florine
whom
i
have
had
the
weakness
to
forgive
begs
you
to
send
us
an
article
on
nathan
s
hat
fare
thee
well
my
son
i
can
only
commiserate
you
on
finding
yourself
back
in
the
same
box
from
which
you
emerged
when
you
discovered
your
old
comrade
etienne
poor
fellows
they
have
been
gambling
for
me
said
lucien
he
was
quite
touched
by
the
letter
a
waft
of
the
breeze
from
an
unhealthy
country
from
the
land
where
one
has
suffered
most
may
seem
to
bring
the
odors
of
paradise
and
in
a
dull
life
there
is
an
indefinable
sweetness
in
memories
of
past
pain
eve
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
when
her
brother
came
down
in
his
new
clothes
she
did
not
recognize
him
now
i
can
walk
out
in
beaulieu
he
cried
they
shall
not
say
it
of
me
that
i
came
back
in
rags
look
here
is
a
watch
which
i
shall
return
to
you
for
it
is
mine
and
like
its
owner
it
is
erratic
in
its
what
a
child
he
is
exclaimed
eve
it
is
impossible
to
bear
you
any
then
do
you
imagine
my
dear
girl
that
i
sent
for
all
this
with
the
silly
idea
of
shining
in
angouleme
i
don
t
care
for
angouleme
twirling
his
cane
with
the
engraved
gold
knob
i
intend
to
repair
the
wrong
i
have
done
and
this
is
my
battle
lucien
s
success
in
this
kind
was
his
one
real
triumph
but
the
triumph
be
it
said
was
immense
if
admiration
freezes
some
people
s
tongues
envy
loosens
at
least
as
many
more
and
if
women
lost
their
heads
over
lucien
men
slandered
him
he
might
have
cried
in
the
words
of
the
songwriter
i
thank
thee
my
coat
he
left
two

it
was
eight
o
clock
before

conspicuous
among

an

gentlemen
called
the

rising
to
his

the

the
rightful

what

we

generation
of

rose
to
the
hero
of

said
to

faculty
of

bravo
cried
the
prefect
leading
the
applause
then
called
upon
all
lucien
s
schoolfellows
there
present
to
the
pride
of
the
of
angouleme
to
the
venerable
headmaster
so
dear
to
us
all
to
whom
the
acknowledgment
for
some
part
of
our
triumph
is
due
the
old
headmaster
dried
his
eyes
he
had
not
expected
this
toast
lucien
rose
to
his
feet
the
whole
room
was
suddenly
silent
and
the
poet
s
face
grew
white
in
that
pause
the
old
headmaster
who
sat
on
his
left
crowned
him
with
a
laurel
wreath
a
round
of
applause
followed
and
when
lucien
spoke
it
was
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
a
sob
in
his
throat
he
is
drunk
remarked
the
to
his
neighbor
my
dear
my
dear
comrades
lucien
said
at
last
i
could
wish
that
all
france
might
witness
this
scene
for
thus
men
rise
to
their
full
stature
and
in
such
ways
as
these
our
land
demands
great
deeds
and
noble
work
of
us
and
when
i
think
of
the
little
that
i
have
done
and
of
this
great
honor
shown
to
me
i
can
only
feel
confused
and
impose
upon
the
future
the
task
of
justifying
your
reception
of
me
the
recollection
of
this
moment
will
give
me
renewed
strength
for
efforts
to
come
permit
me
to
indicate
for
your
homage
my
earliest
muse
and
protectress
and
to
associate
her
name
with
that
of
my
birthplace
so
to
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
the
noble
town
of
angouleme
he
came
out
of
that
pretty
well
said
the
public
prosecutor
nodding
approval
our
speeches
were
all
prepared
and
his
was
at
ten
o
clock
the
party
began
to
break
up
and
little
knots
of
guests
went
home
together
david
sechard
heard
the
unwonted
music
what
is
going
on
in
l
houmeau
he
asked
of
basine
they
are
giving
a
dinner
to
your
lucien
i
know
that
he
would
feel
sorry
to
miss
me
there
he
said
at
midnight
walked
home
with
lucien
as
they
reached
the
place
du
murier
lucien
said
come
life
come
death
we
are
friends
my
dear
my
marriage
contract
said
the
lawyer
with
mlle
francoise
de
la
haye
will
be
signed
at
mme
de
senonches
house
do
me
the
pleasure
of
coming
mme
de
senonches
implored
me
to
bring
you
and
you
will
meet
mme
du
chatelet
they
are
sure
to
tell
her
of
your
speech
and
she
will
feel
flattered
by
i
knew
what
i
was
about
said
lucien
oh
you
will
save
i
am
sure
i
shall
the
poet
replied
just
at
that
moment
david
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
the
place
du
murier
this
was
how
it
had
come
about
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
rather
difficult
position
his
wife
insisted
that
lucien
must
neither
go
to
david
nor
know
of
his
and
lucien
all
the
while
was
writing
the
most
affectionate
letters
saying
that
in
a
few
days
time
all
should
be
set
right
and
even
as
basine
clerget
explained
the
reason
why
the
band
played
she
put
two
letters
into
his
hands
the
first
was
from
eve
dearest
she
wrote
do
as
if
lucien
were
not
here
do
not
trouble
yourself
in
the
least
our
whole
security
depends
upon
the
fact
that
your
enemies
can
not
find
you
get
that
idea
firmly
into
your
head
i
have
more
confidence
in
kolb
and
marion
and
basine
than
in
my
own
brother
such
is
my
misfortune
alas
poor
lucien
is
not
the
ingenuous
and
poet
whom
we
used
to
know
and
it
is
simply
because
he
is
trying
to
interfere
on
your
behalf
and
because
he
imagines
that
he
can
discharge
our
debts
and
this
from
pride
my
david
that
i
am
afraid
of
him
some
fine
clothes
have
been
sent
from
paris
for
him
and
five
gold
pieces
in
a
pretty
purse
he
gave
the
money
to
me
and
we
are
living
on
it
we
have
one
enemy
the
less
your
father
has
gone
thanks
to
unraveled
his
designs
and
put
an
end
to
them
at
once
by
telling
him
that
you
would
do
nothing
without
consulting
him
and
that
he
would
not
allow
you
to
concede
a
single
point
in
the
matter
of
the
invention
until
you
had
been
promised
an
indemnity
of
thirty
thousand
francs
fifteen
thousand
to
free
you
from
embarrassment
and
fifteen
thousand
more
to
be
yours
in
any
case
whether
your
invention
succeeds
or
no
i
can
not
understand
i
embrace
you
dear
a
wife
s
kiss
for
her
husband
in
trouble
our
little
lucien
is
well
how
strange
it
is
to
watch
him
grow
rosy
and
strong
like
a
flower
in
these
stormy
days
mother
prays
god
for
you
now
as
always
and
sends
love
only
less
tender
than
your
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
cointets
had
taken
fright
at
old
sechard
s
peasant
shrewdness
and
got
rid
of
him
so
much
the
more
easily
because
it
was
now
vintage
time
at
marsac
eve
s
letter
enclosed
another
from
lucien
my
dear
david
everything
is
going
well
i
am
armed
i
open
the
campaign
and
in
hours
i
shall
have
made
great
progress
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
embrace
you
when
you
are
free
again
and
my
debts
are
all
paid
my
mother
and
sister
persist
in
mistrusting
me
their
suspicion
wounds
me
to
the
quick
as
if
i
did
not
know
already
that
you
are
hiding
with
basine
for
every
time
that
basine
comes
to
the
house
i
hear
news
of
you
and
receive
answers
to
my
letters
and
besides
it
is
plain
that
my
sister
could
not
find
any
one
else
to
trust
it
hurts
me
cruelly
to
think
that
i
shall
be
so
near
you
and
yet
that
you
will
not
be
present
at
this
banquet
in
my
honor
i
owe
my
little
triumph
to
the
vainglory
of
angouleme
in
a
few
days
it
will
be
quite
forgotten
and
you
alone
would
have
taken
a
real
pleasure
in
it
but
after
all
in
a
little
while
you
will
pardon
everything
to
one
who
counts
it
more
than
all
the
triumphs
in
the
world
to
be
your
brother
two
forces
tugged
sharply
at
david
s
heart
he
adored
his
wife
and
if
he
held
lucien
in
somewhat
less
esteem
his
friendship
was
scarcely
diminished
in
solitude
our
feelings
have
unrestricted
play
and
a
man
preoccupied
like
david
with
thoughts
will
give
way
to
impulses
for
which
ordinary
life
would
have
provided
a
sufficient
counterpoise
as
he
read
lucien
s
letter
to
the
sound
of
military
music
and
heard
of
this
recognition
he
was
deeply
touched
by
that
expression
of
regret
he
had
known
how
it
would
be
a
very
slight
expression
of
feeling
appeals
irresistibly
to
a
sensitive
soul
for
they
are
apt
to
credit
others
with
like
depths
how
should
the
drop
fall
unless
the
cup
were
full
to
the
brim
so
at
midnight
in
spite
of
all
basine
s
entreaties
david
must
go
to
see
lucien
nobody
will
be
out
in
the
streets
at
this
time
of
night
he
said
i
shall
not
be
seen
and
they
can
not
arrest
me
even
if
i
should
meet
people
i
can
make
use
of
kolb
s
way
of
going
into
hiding
and
besides
it
is
so
intolerably
long
since
i
saw
my
wife
and
the
reasoning
was
plausible
enough
basine
gave
way
and
david
went
was
just
taking
leave
as
he
came
up
and
at
his
cry
of
lucien
the
two
brothers
flung
their
arms
about
each
other
with
tears
in
their
eyes
life
holds
not
many
moments
such
as
these
lucien
s
heart
went
out
in
response
to
this
friendship
for
its
own
sake
there
was
never
question
of
debtor
and
creditor
between
them
and
the
offender
met
with
no
reproaches
save
his
own
david
generous
and
noble
that
he
was
was
longing
to
bestow
pardon
he
meant
first
of
all
to
read
lucien
a
lecture
and
scatter
the
clouds
that
overspread
the
love
of
the
brother
and
sister
and
with
these
ends
in
view
the
lack
of
money
and
its
consequent
dangers
disappeared
entirely
from
his
mind
go
home
said
addressing
his
client
take
advantage
of
your
imprudence
to
see
your
wife
and
child
again
at
any
rate
and
you
must
not
be
seen
mind
you
how
unlucky
he
added
when
he
was
alone
in
the
place
du
murier
if
only
cerizet
were
here
the
buildings
magniloquently
styled
the
angouleme
law
courts
were
then
in
process
of
construction
muttered
these
words
to
himself
as
he
passed
by
the
hoardings
and
heard
a
tap
upon
the
boards
and
a
voice
issuing
from
a
crack
between
two
planks
here
i
am
said
cerizet
i
saw
david
coming
out
of
l
houmeau
i
was
beginning
to
have
my
suspicions
about
his
retreat
and
now
i
am
sure
and
i
know
where
to
have
him
but
i
want
to
know
something
of
lucien
s
plans
before
i
set
the
snare
for
david
and
here
are
you
sending
him
into
the
house
find
some
excuse
for
stopping
here
at
least
and
when
david
and
lucien
come
out
send
them
round
this
way
they
will
think
they
are
quite
alone
and
i
shall
overhear
their
you
are
a
very
devil
muttered
well
i
m
blessed
if
a
man
wouldn
t
do
anything
for
the
thing
you
promised
walked
away
from
the
hoarding
and
paced
up
and
down
in
the
place
du
murier
he
watched
the
windows
of
the
room
where
the
family
sat
together
and
thought
of
his
own
prospects
to
keep
up
his
courage
cerizet
s
cleverness
had
given
him
the
chance
of
striking
the
final
blow
was
a
of
the
profoundly
cautious
stamp
that
is
never
caught
by
the
bait
of
a
present
satisfaction
nor
entangled
by
a
personal
attachment
after
his
first
initiation
into
the
strategy
of
and
the
instability
of
the
human
heart
so
from
the
very
first
he
had
put
little
trust
in
cointet
he
foresaw
that
his
marriage
negotiations
might
very
easily
be
broken
off
saw
also
that
in
that
case
he
could
not
accuse
cointet
of
bad
faith
and
he
had
taken
his
measures
accordingly
but
since
his
success
at
the
hotel
de
bargeton
s
game
was
above
board
a
certain
of
his
was
useless
now
and
even
dangerous
to
a
man
with
his
political
ambitions
he
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
future
importance
in
the
following
manner
gannerac
and
a
few
of
the
wealthy
men
of
business
in
l
houmeau
formed
a
sort
of
liberal
clique
in
constant
communication
through
commercial
channels
with
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
the
villele
ministry
accepted
by
the
dying
louis
gave
the
signal
for
a
change
of
tactics
in
the
opposition
camp
for
since
the
death
of
napoleon
the
liberals
had
ceased
to
resort
to
the
dangerous
expedient
of
conspiracy
they
were
busy
organizing
resistance
by
lawful
means
throughout
the
provinces
and
aiming
at
securing
control
of
the
great
bulk
of
electors
by
convincing
the
masses
a
rabid
liberal
and
a
man
of
l
houmeau
was
the
instigator
the
secret
counselor
and
the
very
life
of
this
movement
in
the
lower
town
which
groaned
under
the
tyranny
of
the
aristocrats
at
the
upper
end
he
was
the
first
to
see
the
danger
of
leaving
the
whole
press
of
the
department
in
the
control
of
the
cointets
the
opposition
must
have
its
organ
it
would
not
do
to
be
behind
other
cities
if
each
one
of
us
gives
gannerac
a
bill
for
five
hundred
francs
he
would
have
some
twenty
thousand
francs
and
more
we
might
buy
up
sechard
s
and
we
could
do
as
we
liked
with
the
if
we
lent
him
the
capital
had
said
others
had
taken
up
the
idea
and
in
this
way
strengthened
his
position
with
regard
to
david
on
the
one
side
and
the
cointets
on
the
other
casting
about
him
for
a
tool
for
his
party
he
naturally
thought
that
a
rogue
of
cerizet
s
calibre
was
the
very
man
for
the
purpose
if
you
can
find
sechard
s
and
put
him
in
our
hands
somebody
will
lend
you
twenty
thousand
francs
to
buy
his
business
and
very
likely
there
will
be
a
newspaper
to
print
so
set
about
it
he
had
said
put
more
faith
in
cerizet
s
activity
than
in
all
the
doublons
in
existence
and
then
it
was
that
he
promised
cointet
that
sechard
should
be
arrested
but
now
that
the
little
lawyer
cherished
hopes
of
office
he
saw
that
he
must
turn
his
back
upon
the
liberals
and
meanwhile
the
amount
for
the
had
been
subscribed
in
l
houmeau
decided
to
allow
things
to
take
their
natural
course
pooh
he
thought
cerizet
will
get
into
trouble
with
his
paper
and
give
me
an
opportunity
of
displaying
my
he
walked
up
to
the
door
of
the
and
spoke
to
kolb
the
sentinel

and

hundred
paces
ahead
of
them
and
marion
at
the
same
distance
behind
the
two
friends
walked
past
the
hoarding
lucien
talking
eagerly
the
while
my
plan
is
extremely
simple
david
but
how
could
i
tell
you
about
it
while
eve
was
there
she
would
never
understand
i
am
quite
sure
that
at
the
bottom
of
louise
s
heart
there
is
a
feeling
that
i
can
rouse
and
i
should
like
to
arouse
it
if
it
is
only
to
avenge
myself
upon
that
idiot
the
prefect
if
our
love
affair
only
lasts
for
a
week
i
will
contrive
to
send
an
application
through
her
for
the
subvention
of
twenty
thousand
francs
for
you
i
am
going
to
see
her
again
in
the
little
boudoir
where
our
old
affair
of
the
heart
began
says
that
the
room
is
the
same
as
ever
i
shall
play
my
part
in
the
comedy
and
i
will
send
word
by
basine
morning
to
tell
you
whether
the
actor
was
hissed
you
may
be
at
liberty
by
then
who
knows
now
do
you
understand
how
it
was
that
i
wanted
clothes
from
paris
one
can
not
act
the
lover
s
part
in
at
six
o
clock
that
morning
cerizet
went
to
doublon
can
be
ready
to
take
his
man
at
noon
i
will
answer
for
it
he
said
i
know
one
of
mlle
clerget
s
girls
do
you
understand
cerizet
unfolded
his
plan
and
hurried
to
find
cointet
if
francis
du
hautoy
will
settle
his
property
on
francoise
you
shall
sign
a
deed
of
partnership
with
sechard
in
two
days
i
shall
not
be
married
for
a
week
after
the
contract
is
signed
so
we
shall
both
be
within
the
terms
of
our
little
agreement
tit
for
tat
however
we
must
keep
a
close
watch
over
lucien
and
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
for
the
whole
business
lies
in
that
if
lucien
hopes
to
succeed
through
the
countess
influence
i
have
david
safe
you
will
be
keeper
of
the
seals
yet
it
is
my
belief
said
cointet
and
why
not
no
one
objects
to
de
peyronnet
said
he
had
not
altogether
sloughed
his
skin
of
liberalism
mlle
de
la
haye
s
ambiguous
position
brought
most
of
the
upper
town
to
the
signing
of
the
marriage
contract
the
comparative
poverty
of
the
young
couple
and
the
absence
of
a
quickened
the
interest
that
people
love
to
exhibit
for
it
is
with
beneficence
as
with
ovations
we
prefer
the
deeds
of
charity
which
gratify
the
marquise
de
pimentel
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
de
senonches
and
one
or
two
frequenters
of
the
house
had
given
francoise
a
few
wedding
presents
which
made
great
talk
in
the
city
these
pretty
trifles
together
with
the
trousseau
which
zephirine
had
been
preparing
for
the
past
twelve
months
the
godfather
s
jewels
and
the
usual
wedding
gifts
consoled
francoise
and
roused
the
curiosity
of
some
mothers
of
daughters
and
cointet
had
both
remarked
that
their
presence
in
the
angouleme
olympus
was
endured
rather
than
courted
cointet
was
francoise
s
trustee
and
and
if
was
to
sign
the
contract
s
presence
was
as
necessary
as
the
attendance
of
the
man
to
be
hanged
at
an
execution
but
though
once
married
mme
might
keep
her
right
of
entry
to
her
godmother
s
house
foresaw
some
difficulty
on
his
own
account
and
resolved
to
be
beforehand
with
these
haughty
personages
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
parents
he
had
sent
his
mother
to
stay
at
mansle
now
he
begged
her
to
say
that
she
was
out
of
health
and
to
give
her
consent
in
writing
so
humiliating
was
it
to
be
without
relations
protectors
or
witnesses
to
his
signature
that
thought
himself
in
luck
that
he
could
bring
a
presentable
friend
at
the
countess
request
he
called
to
take
up
lucien
and
they
drove
to
the
hotel
de
bargeton
on
that
memorable
evening
the
poet
dressed
to
outshine
every
man
present
mme
de
senonches
had
spoken
of
him
as
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
a
first
interview
between
two
estranged
lovers
is
the
kind
of
scene
that
provincials
particularly
love
lucien
had
come
to
be
the
lion
of
the
evening
he
was
said
to
be
so
handsome
so
much
changed
so
wonderful
that
every
woman
in
angouleme
was
curious
to
see
him
again
following
the
fashion
of
the
transition
period
between
the
eighteenth
century
small
clothes
and
the
vulgar
costume
of
the
present
day
he
wore
black
trousers
men
still
showed
their
figures
in
those
days
to
the
utter
despair
of
lean
mortals
and
lucien
was
an
apollo
the
gray
silk
stockings
the
neat
shoes
and
the
black
satin
waistcoat
were
scrupulously
drawn
over
his
person
and
seemed
to
cling
to
him
his
forehead
looked
the
whiter
by
contrast
with
the
thick
bright
curls
that
rose
above
it
with
studied
grace
the
proud
eyes
were
radiant
the
hands
small
as
a
woman
s
never
showed
to
better
advantage
than
when
gloved
he
had
modeled
himself
upon
de
marsay
the
famous
parisian
dandy
holding
his
hat
and
cane
in
one
hand
and
keeping
the
other
free
for
the
very
occasional
gestures
which
illustrated
his
talk
lucien
had
quite
intended
to
emulate
the
famous
false
modesty
of
those
who
bend
their
heads
to
pass
beneath
the
porte
and
to
slip
unobserved
into
the
room
but
having
but
one
friend
made
him
useful
he
brought
lucien
almost
pompously
through
a
crowded
room
to
mme
de
senonches
the
poet
heard
a
murmur
as
he
passed
not
so
very
long
ago
that
hum
of
voices
would
have
turned
his
head
he
was
quite
different
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
himself
was
greater
than
the
whole
olympus
put
together
madame
he
said
addressing
mme
de
senonches
i
have
already
congratulated
my
friend
a
man
with
the
stuff
in
him
of
which
keepers
of
the
seals
are
made
on
the
honor
of
his
approaching
connection
with
you
slight
as
are
the
ties
between
godmother
and
goddaughter
this
with
the
air
of
a
man
uttering
an
epigram
by
no
means
lost
upon
any
woman
in
the
room
for
every
woman
was
listening
without
appearing
to
do
so
and
as
for
myself
he
continued
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
paying
my
homage
to
he
spoke
easily
and
fluently
as
some
great
lord
might
speak
under
the
roof
of
his
inferiors
and
as
he
listened
to
zephirine
s
involved
reply
he
cast
a
glance
over
the
room
to
consider
the
effect
that
he
wished
to
make
the
pause
gave
him
time
to
discover
francis
du
hautoy
and
the
prefect
to
bow
gracefully
to
each
with
the
proper
shade
of
difference
in
his
smile
and
finally
to
approach
mme
du
chatelet
as
if
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
her
that
meeting
was
the
real
event
of
the
evening
no
one
so
much
as
thought
of
the
marriage
contract
lying
in
the
adjoining
bedroom
whither
francoise
and
the
notary
led
guest
after
guest
to
sign
the
document
lucien
made
a
step
towards
louise
de
negrepelisse
and
then
spoke
with
that
grace
of
manner
now
associated
for
her
with
memories
of
paris
do
i
owe
to
you
madame
the
pleasure
of
an
invitation
to
dine
at
the
prefecture
the
day
after
he
said
you
owe
it
solely
to
your
fame
monsieur
louise
answered
drily
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
turn
of
a
phrase
by
which
lucien
deliberately
tried
to
wound
her
pride
ah
madame
la
comtesse
i
can
not
bring
you
the
guest
if
the
man
is
in
disgrace
said
lucien
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
and
greeted
the
bishop
with
stately
grace
your
lordship
s
prophecy
has
been
partially
fulfilled
he
said
and
there
was
a
winning
charm
in
his
tones
i
will
endeavor
to
fulfil
it
to
the
letter
i
consider
myself
very
fortunate
since
this
evening
brings
me
an
opportunity
of
paying
my
respects
to
lucien
drew
the
bishop
into
a
conversation
that
lasted
for
ten
minutes
the
women
looked
on
lucien
as
a
phenomenon
his
unexpected
insolence
had
struck
mme
du
chatelet
dumb
she
could
not
find
an
answer
looking
round
the
room
she
saw
that
every
woman
admired
lucien
she
watched
group
after
group
repeating
the
phrases
by
which
lucien
crushed
her
with
seeming
disdain
and
her
heart
contracted
with
a
spasm
of
mortification
suppose
that
he
should
not
come
to
the
prefecture
after
this
what
talk
there
would
be
she
thought
where
did
he
learn
this
pride
can
mlle
des
touches
have
taken
a
fancy
for
him
he
is
so
handsome
they
say
that
she
hurried
to
see
him
in
paris
the
day
after
that
actress
died
perhaps
he
has
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
and
happened
to
be
behind
our
caleche
at
mansle
by
accident
lucien
looked
at
us
very
strangely
that
a
crowd
of
thoughts
crossed
louise
s
brain
and
unluckily
for
her
she
continued
to
ponder
visibly
as
she
watched
lucien
he
was
talking
with
the
bishop
as
if
he
were
the
king
of
the
room
making
no
effort
to
find
any
one
out
waiting
till
others
came
to
him
looking
round
about
him
with
varying
expression
and
as
much
at
his
ease
as
his
model
de
marsay
de
senonches
appeared
at
no
great
distance
but
lucien
still
stood
beside
the
prelate
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
louise
could
contain
herself
no
longer
she
rose
and
went
over
to
the
bishop
and
said
what
is
being
said
my
lord
that
you
smile
so
often
lucien
drew
back
discreetly
and
left
mme
du
chatelet
with
his
lordship
ah
mme
la
comtesse
what
a
clever
young
fellow
he
is
he
was
explaining
to
me
that
he
owed
all
he
is
to
you
am
not
ungrateful
madame
said
lucien
with
a
reproachful
glance
that
charmed
the
countess
let
us
have
an
understanding
she
said
beckoning
him
with
her
fan
come
into
the
boudoir
my
lord
bishop
you
shall
judge
between
she
has
found
a
funny
task
for
his
lordship
said
one
of
the
chandour
camp
sufficiently
audibly
judge
between
us
repeated
lucien
looking
from
the
prelate
to
the
lady
then
is
one
of
us
in
fault
louise
de
negrepelisse
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
familiar
boudoir
she
made
the
bishop
sit
on
one
side
and
lucien
on
the
other
then
she
began
to
speak
but
lucien
to
the
joy
and
surprise
of
his
old
love
honored
her
with
inattention
her
words
fell
unheeded
on
his
ears
he
sat
like
pasta
in
with
the
words
patria
upon
her
lips
the
music
of
the
great
cavatina
might
have
passed
into
his
face
indeed
coralie
s
pupil
had
contrived
to
bring
the
tears
to
his
eyes
oh
louise
how
i
loved
you
he
murmured
careless
of
the
bishop
s
presence
heedless
of
the
conversation
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
the
countess
had
seen
the
tears
dry
your
eyes
or
you
will
ruin
me
here
a
second
time
she
said
in
an
aside
that
horrified
the
prelate
and
once
is
enough
was
lucien
s
quick
retort
that
speech
from
mme
d
espard
s
cousin
would
dry
the
eyes
of
a
weeping
magdalene
oh
me
for
a
little
moment
old
memories
and
lost
illusions
and
my
twentieth
year
came
back
to
me
and
you
have
his
lordship
hastily
retreated
to
the
at
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
dignity
was
like
to
be
compromised
by
this
sentimental
pair
every
one
ostentatiously
refrained
from
interrupting
them
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
till
at
last
sixte
du
chatelet
vexed
by
the
laughter
and
talk
and
excursions
to
the
boudoir
door
went
in
with
a
countenance
distinctly
overclouded
and
found
louise
and
lucien
talking
excitedly
madame
said
sixte
in
his
wife
s
ear
you
know
angouleme
better
than
i
do
and
surely
you
should
think
of
your
position
as
mme
la
prefete
and
of
the
government
my
dear
said
louise
scanning
her
responsible
editor
with
a
haughtiness
that
made
him
quake
i
am
talking
with
de
rubempre
of
matters
which
interest
you
it
is
a
question
of
rescuing
an
inventor
about
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
basest
machinations
you
will
help
us
as
to
those
ladies
yonder
and
their
opinion
of
me
you
shall
see
how
i
will
freeze
the
venom
of
their
she
came
out
of
the
boudoir
on
lucien
s
arm
and
drew
him
across
to
sign
the
contract
with
a
great
lady
s
audacity
write
your
name
after
mine
she
said
handing
him
the
pen
and
lucien
submissively
signed
in
the
place
indicated
beneath
her
name
m
de
senonches
would
you
have
recognized
de
rubempre
she
continued
and
the
insolent
sportsman
was
compelled
to
greet
lucien
she
returned
to
the
on
lucien
s
arm
and
seated
him
on
the
central
sofa
between
herself
and
zephirine
there
enthroned
like
a
queen
she
began
at
first
in
a
low
voice
a
conversation
in
which
epigram
evidently
was
not
wanting
some
of
her
old
friends
and
several
women
who
paid
court
to
her
came
to
join
the
group
and
lucien
soon
became
the
hero
of
the
circle
the
countess
drew
him
out
on
the
subject
of
life
in
paris
his
satirical
talk
flowed
with
spontaneous
and
incredible
spirit
he
told
anecdotes
of
celebrities
those
conversational
luxuries
which
the
provincial
devours
with
such
avidity
his
wit
was
as
much
admired
as
his
good
looks
and
mme
la
comtesse
sixte
du
chatelet
preparing
lucien
s
triumph
so
patiently
sat
like
a
player
enraptured
with
the
sound
of
his
instrument
she
gave
him
opportunities
for
a
reply
she
looked
round
the
circle
for
applause
so
openly
that
not
a
few
of
the
women
began
to
think
that
their
return
together
was
something
more
than
a
coincidence
and
that
lucien
and
louise
loving
with
all
their
hearts
had
been
separated
by
a
double
treason
pique
very
likely
had
brought
about
this
match
with
chatelet
and
a
reaction
set
in
against
the
prefect
before
the
countess
rose
to
go
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
turned
to
lucien
and
said
in
a
low
voice
do
me
the
pleasure
of
coming
punctually
then
with
the
friendliest
little
nod
she
went
saying
a
few
words
to
chatelet
who
was
looking
for
his
hat
if
mme
du
chatelet
has
given
me
a
correct
idea
of
the
state
of
affairs
count
on
me
my
dear
lucien
said
the
prefect
preparing
to
hurry
after
his
wife
she
was
going
away
without
him
after
the
paris
fashion
your
may
consider
that
his
troubles
are
at
an
end
he
added
as
he
went
m
le
comte
surely
owes
me
so
much
smiled
lucien
cointet
and
heard
these
farewell
speeches
well
well
we
are
done
for
now
cointet
muttered
in
his
confederate
s
ear
thunderstruck
by
lucien
s
success
amazed
by
his
brilliant
wit
and
varying
charm
was
gazing
at
francoise
de
la
haye
the
girl
s
whole
face
was
full
of
admiration
for
lucien
be
like
your
friend
she
seemed
to
say
to
her
betrothed
a
gleam
of
joy
flitted
over
s
countenance
we
still
have
a
whole
day
before
the
prefect
s
dinner
i
will
answer
for
an
hour
later
as
and
lucien
walked
home
together
lucien
talked
of
his
success
well
my
dear
fellow
i
came
i
saw
i
conquered
sechard
will
be
very
happy
in
a
few
hours
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
thought
aloud
he
said
i
thought
you
were
simply
a
poet
lucien
but
you
are
a
lauzun
too
that
is
to
say
twice
a
poet
and
they
shook
hands
for
the
last
time
as
it
proved
good
news
dear
eve
said
lucien
waking
his
sister
david
will
have
no
debts
in
less
than
a
month
how
is
that
well
my
louise
is
still
hidden
by
mme
du
chatelet
s
petticoat
she
loves
me
more
than
ever
she
will
send
a
favorable
report
of
our
discovery
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
through
her
husband
so
we
have
only
to
endure
our
troubles
for
one
month
while
i
avenge
myself
on
the
prefect
and
complete
the
happiness
of
his
married
eve
listened
and
thought
that
she
must
be
dreaming
i
saw
the
little
gray
where
i
trembled
like
a
child
two
years
ago
it
seemed
as
if
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
when
i
saw
the
furniture
and
the
pictures
and
the
faces
again
how
paris
changes
one
s
ideas
is
that
a
good
thing
asked
eve
at
last
beginning
to
understand
come
come
you
are
still
asleep
we
will
talk
about
it
after
cerizet
s
plot
was
exceedingly
simple
a
commonplace
stratagem
familiar
to
the
provincial
bailiff
its
success
entirely
depends
upon
circumstances
and
in
this
case
it
was
certain
so
intimate
was
cerizet
s
knowledge
of
the
characters
and
hopes
of
those
concerned
cerizet
had
been
a
kind
of
don
juan
among
the
young
ruling
his
victims
by
playing
one
off
against
another
since
he
had
been
the
cointet
s
extra
foreman
he
had
singled
out
one
of
basine
clerget
s
assistants
a
girl
almost
as
handsome
as
mme
sechard
henriette
signol
s
parents
owned
a
small
vineyard
two
leagues
out
of
angouleme
on
the
road
to
saintes
the
signols
like
everybody
else
in
the
country
could
not
afford
to
keep
their
only
child
at
home
so
they
meant
her
to
go
out
to
service
in
country
phrase
the
art
of
is
a
part
of
every
country
housemaid
s
training
and
so
great
was
mme
prieur
s
reputation
that
the
signols
sent
henriette
to
her
as
apprentice
and
paid
for
their
daughter
s
board
and
lodging
mme
prieur
was
one
of
the
mistresses
who
consider
that
they
fill
a
parent
s
place
towards
their
apprentices
they
were
part
of
the
family
she
took
them
with
her
to
church
and
looked
scrupulously
after
them
henriette
signol
was
a
tall
girl
with
bold
eyes
and
long
thick
dark
hair
and
the
pale
very
fair
complexion
of
girls
in
the
south
white
as
a
magnolia
flower
for
which
reasons
henriette
was
one
of
the
first
on
whom
cerizet
cast
his
eyes
but
henriette
came
of
honest
farmer
folk
and
only
yielded
at
last
to
jealousy
to
bad
example
and
the
treacherous
promise
of
subsequent
marriage
by
this
time
cerizet
was
the
cointet
s
foreman
when
he
learned
that
the
signols
owned
a
vineyard
worth
some
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
and
a
tolerably
comfortable
cottage
he
hastened
to
make
it
impossible
for
henriette
to
marry
any
one
else
affairs
had
reached
this
point
when
held
out
the
prospect
of
a
printing
office
and
twenty
thousand
francs
of
borrowed
capital
which
was
to
prove
a
yoke
upon
the
borrower
s
neck
cerizet
was
dazzled
the
offer
turned
his
head
henriette
signol
was
now
only
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
ambitions
and
he
neglected
the
poor
girl
henriette
in
her
despair
clung
more
closely
to
her
seducer
as
he
tried
to
shake
her
off
when
cerizet
began
to
suspect
that
david
was
hiding
in
basine
s
house
his
views
with
regard
to
henriette
underwent
another
change
though
he
treated
her
as
before
a
kind
of
frenzy
works
in
a
girl
s
brain
when
she
must
marry
her
seducer
to
conceal
her
dishonor
and
cerizet
was
on
the
watch
to
turn
this
madness
to
his
own
account
during
the
morning
of
the
day
when
lucien
had
set
himself
to
reconquer
his
louise
cerizet
told
basine
s
secret
to
henriette
giving
her
to
understand
at
the
same
time
that
their
marriage
and
future
prospects
depended
upon
the
discovery
of
david
s
thus
instructed
henriette
easily
made
certain
of
the
fact
that
david
was
in
basine
clerget
s
inner
room
it
never
occurred
to
the
girl
that
she
was
doing
wrong
to
act
the
spy
and
cerizet
involved
her
in
the
guilt
of
betrayal
by
this
first
step
lucien
was
still
sleeping
while
cerizet
closeted
with
heard
the
history
of
the
important
trifles
with
which
all
angouleme
presently
would
ring
the
cointets
foreman
gave
a
satisfied
nod
as
came
to
an
end
lucien
surely
has
written
you
a
line
since
he
came
back
has
he
not
he
asked
this
is
all
that
i
have
answered
the
lawyer
and
he
held
out
a
note
on
mme
sechard
s
very
well
said
cerizet
let
doublon
be
in
wait
at
the
palet
gate
about
ten
minutes
before
sunset
tell
him
to
post
his
gendarmes
and
you
shall
have
our
are
you
sure
of
part
of
the
business
asked
scanning
cerizet
i
rely
on
chance
said
the
boy
and
she
is
a
saucy
huzzy
she
does
not
like
honest
folk
you
must
succeed
said
cerizet
you
have
pushed
me
into
this
dirty
business
you
may
as
well
let
me
have
a
few
banknotes
to
wipe
off
the
then
detecting
a
look
that
he
did
not
like
in
the
attorney
s
face
he
continued
with
a
deadly
glance
if
you
have
cheated
me
sir
if
you
don
t
buy
the
for
me
within
a
week
you
will
leave
a
young
widow
he
lowered
his
voice
if
we
have
david
on
the
jail
register
at
six
o
clock
come
round
to
gannerac
s
at
nine
and
we
will
settle
your
business
said
peremptorily
agreed
your
will
shall
be
done
governor
said
cerizet
cerizet
understood
the
art
of
washing
paper
a
dangerous
art
for
the
treasury
he
washed
out
lucien
s
four
lines
and
replaced
them
imitating
the
handwriting
with
a
dexterity
which
augured
ill
for
his
own
future
my
dear
david
your
business
is
settled
you
need
not
fear
to
go
to
the
prefect
you
can
go
out
at
sunset
i
will
come
to
meet
you
and
tell
you
what
to
do
at
the
your
brother
at
noon
lucien
wrote
to
david
telling
him
of
his
evening
s
success
the
prefect
would
be
sure
to
lend
his
influence
he
said
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
over
the
invention
and
was
drawing
up
a
report
that
very
day
to
send
to
the
government
marion
carried
the
letter
to
basine
taking
some
of
lucien
s
linen
to
the
laundry
as
a
pretext
for
the
errand
had
told
cerizet
that
a
letter
would
in
all
probability
be
sent
cerizet
called
for
mlle
signol
and
the
two
walked
by
the
charente
henriette
s
integrity
must
have
held
out
for
a
long
while
for
the
walk
lasted
for
two
hours
a
whole
future
of
happiness
and
ease
and
the
interests
of
a
child
were
at
stake
and
cerizet
asked
a
mere
trifle
of
her
he
was
very
careful
besides
to
say
nothing
of
the
consequences
of
that
trifle
she
was
only
to
carry
a
letter
and
a
message
that
was
all
but
it
was
the
greatness
of
the
reward
for
the
trifling
service
that
frightened
henriette
nevertheless
cerizet
gained
her
consent
at
last
she
would
help
him
in
his
stratagem
at
five
o
clock
henriette
must
go
out
and
come
in
again
telling
basine
clerget
that
mme
sechard
wanted
to
speak
to
her
at
once
fifteen
minutes
after
basine
s
departure
she
must
go
upstairs
knock
at
the
door
of
the
inner
room
and
give
david
the
forged
note
that
was
all
cerizet
looked
to
chance
to
manage
the
rest
for
the
first
time
in
twelve
months
eve
felt
the
iron
grasp
of
necessity
relax
a
little
she
began
at
last
to
hope
she
too
would
enjoy
her
brother
s
visit
she
would
show
herself
abroad
on
the
arm
of
a
man
feted
in
his
native
town
adored
by
the
women
beloved
by
the
proud
comtesse
du
chatelet
she
dressed
herself
prettily
and
proposed
to
walk
out
after
dinner
with
her
brother
to
beaulieu
in
september
all
angouleme
comes
out
at
that
hour
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
oh
that
is
the
beautiful
mme
sechard
voices
said
here
and
there
i
should
never
have
believed
it
of
her
said
a
woman
the
husband
is
in
hiding
and
the
wife
walks
abroad
said
mme
postel
for
young
mme
sechard
s
benefit
oh
let
us
go
home
said
poor
eve
i
have
made
a
a
few
minutes
before
sunset
the
sound
of
a
crowd
rose
from
the
steps
that
lead
down
to
l
houmeau
apparently
some
crime
had
been
committed
for
persons
coming
from
l
houmeau
were
talking
among
themselves
curiosity
drew
lucien
and
eve
towards
the
steps
a
thief
has
just
been
arrested
no
doubt
the
man
looks
as
pale
as
death
one
of
these
said
to
the
brother
and
sister
the
crowd
grew
larger
lucien
and
eve
watched
a
group
of
some
thirty
children
old
women
and
men
returning
from
work
clustering
about
the
gendarmes
whose
caps
gleamed
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
about
a
hundred
persons
followed
the
procession
the
crowd
gathering
like
a
storm
cloud
oh
it
is
my
husband
eve
cried
out
david
exclaimed
lucien
it
is
his
wife
said
voices
and
the
crowd
made
way
what
made
you
come
out
asked
lucien
your
letter
said
david
haggard
and
white
i
knew
it
said
eve
and
she
fainted
away
lucien
raised
his
sister
and
with
the
help
of
two
strangers
he
carried
her
home
marion
laid
her
in
bed
and
kolb
rushed
off
for
a
doctor
eve
was
still
insensible
when
the
doctor
arrived
and
lucien
was
obliged
to
confess
to
his
mother
that
he
was
the
cause
of
david
s
arrest
for
he
of
course
knew
nothing
of
the
forged
letter
and
cerizet
s
stratagem
then
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
locked
himself
in
struck
dumb
by
the
malediction
in
his
mother
s
eyes
in
the
dead
of
night
he
wrote
one
more
letter
amid
constant
interruptions
the
reader
can
divine
the
agony
of
the
writer
s
mind
from
those
phrases
jerked
out
as
it
were
one
by
one
my
beloved
sister
we
have
seen
each
other
for
the
last
time
my
resolution
is
final
and
for
this
reason
in
many
families
there
is
one
unlucky
member
a
kind
of
disease
in
their
midst
i
am
that
unlucky
one
in
our
family
the
observation
is
not
mine
it
was
made
at
a
friendly
supper
one
evening
at
the
de
by
a
diplomate
who
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
while
we
laughed
and
joked
he
explained
the
reason
why
some
young
lady
or
some
other
remained
unmarried
to
the
astonishment
of
the
world
it
was
a
touch
of
her
father
he
said
and
with
that
he
unfolded
his
theory
of
inherited
weaknesses
he
told
us
how
such
and
such
a
family
would
have
flourished
but
for
the
mother
how
it
was
that
a
son
had
ruined
his
father
or
a
father
had
stripped
his
children
of
prospects
and
respectability
it
was
said
laughingly
but
we
thought
of
so
many
cases
in
point
in
ten
minutes
that
i
was
struck
with
the
theory
the
amount
of
truth
in
it
furnished
all
sorts
of
wild
paradoxes
which
journalists
maintain
cleverly
enough
for
their
own
amusement
when
there
is
nobody
else
at
hand
to
mystify
i
bring
bad
luck
to
our
family
my
heart
is
full
of
love
for
you
yet
i
behave
like
an
enemy
the
blow
dealt
unintentionally
is
the
cruelest
blow
of
all
while
i
was
leading
a
bohemian
life
in
paris
a
life
made
up
of
pleasure
and
misery
taking
good
fellowship
for
friendship
forsaking
my
true
friends
for
those
who
wished
to
exploit
me
and
succeeded
forgetful
of
you
or
remembering
you
only
to
cause
you
trouble
all
that
while
you
were
walking
in
the
humble
path
of
hard
work
making
your
way
slowly
but
surely
to
the
fortune
which
i
tried
so
madly
to
snatch
while
you
grew
better
i
grew
worse
a
fatal
element
entered
into
my
life
through
my
own
choice
yes
unbounded
ambition
makes
an
obscure
existence
simply
impossible
for
me
i
have
tastes
and
remembrances
of
past
pleasures
that
poison
the
enjoyments
within
my
reach
once
i
should
have
been
satisfied
with
them
now
it
is
too
late
oh
dear
eve
no
one
can
think
more
hardly
of
me
than
i
do
myself
my
condemnation
is
absolute
and
pitiless
the
struggle
in
paris
demands
steady
effort
my
will
power
is
spasmodic
my
brain
works
intermittently
the
future
is
so
appalling
that
i
do
not
care
to
face
it
and
the
present
is
intolerable
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
i
should
have
done
better
to
stay
in
exile
all
my
days
but
exile
without
means
of
subsistence
would
be
madness
i
will
not
add
another
folly
to
the
rest
death
is
better
than
a
maimed
life
i
can
not
think
of
myself
in
any
position
in
which
my
overweening
vanity
would
not
lead
me
into
folly
some
human
beings
are
like
the
figure
another
must
be
put
before
it
and
they
acquire
ten
times
their
value
i
am
nothing
unless
a
strong
inexorable
will
is
wedded
to
mine
mme
de
bargeton
was
in
truth
my
wife
when
i
refused
to
leave
coralie
for
her
i
spoiled
my
life
you
and
david
might
have
been
excellent
pilots
for
me
but
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
tame
my
weakness
which
in
some
sort
eludes
control
i
like
an
easy
life
a
life
without
cares
to
clear
an
obstacle
out
of
my
way
i
can
descend
to
baseness
that
sticks
at
nothing
i
was
born
a
prince
i
have
more
than
the
requisite
intellectual
dexterity
for
success
but
only
by
moments
and
the
prizes
of
a
career
so
crowded
by
ambitious
competitors
are
to
those
who
expend
no
more
than
the
necessary
strength
and
retain
a
sufficient
reserve
when
they
reach
the
goal
i
shall
do
harm
again
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
some
men
are
like
oaks
i
am
a
delicate
shrub
it
may
be
and
i
forsooth
must
needs
aspire
to
be
a
forest
cedar
there
you
have
my
bankrupt
s
schedule
the
disproportion
between
my
powers
and
my
desires
my
want
of
balance
in
short
will
bring
all
my
efforts
to
nothing
there
are
many
such
characters
among
men
of
letters
many
men
whose
intellectual
powers
and
character
are
always
at
variance
who
will
one
thing
and
wish
another
what
would
become
of
me
i
can
see
it
all
beforehand
as
i
think
of
this
and
that
great
light
that
once
shone
on
paris
now
utterly
forgotten
on
the
threshold
of
old
age
i
shall
be
a
man
older
than
my
age
needy
and
without
a
name
my
whole
soul
rises
up
against
the
thought
of
such
a
close
i
will
not
be
a
social
rag
ah
dear
sister
loved
and
worshiped
at
least
as
much
for
your
severity
at
the
last
as
for
your
tenderness
at
the
first
if
we
have
paid
so
dear
for
my
joy
at
seeing
you
all
once
more
you
and
david
may
perhaps
some
day
think
that
you
could
grudge
no
price
however
high
for
a
little
last
happiness
for
an
unhappy
creature
who
loved
you
do
not
try
to
find
me
eve
do
not
seek
to
know
what
becomes
of
me
my
intellect
for
once
shall
be
backed
by
my
will
renunciation
my
angel
is
daily
death
of
self
my
renunciation
will
only
last
for
one
day
i
will
take
advantage
now
of
that
day
o
yes
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
farewell
for
ever
dear
eve
there
is
something
sweet
in
the
thought
that
i
shall
live
only
in
your
hearts
henceforth
and
i
wish
no
other
burying
place
once
more
farewell
that
is
the
last
word
from
your
brother
lucien
read
the
letter
over
crept
noiselessly
down
stairs
and
left
it
in
the
child
s
cradle
amid
falling
tears
he
set
a
last
kiss
on
the
forehead
of
his
sleeping
sister
then
he
went
out
he
put
out
his
candle
in
the
gray
dusk
took
a
last
look
at
the
old
house
stole
softly
along
the
passage
and
opened
the
street
door
but
in
spite
of
his
caution
he
awakened
kolb
who
slept
on
a
mattress
on
the
workshop
floor
who
goes
there
cried
kolb
it
is
i
lucien
i
am
going
away
you
vould
haf
done
better
gif
you
at
nefer
kom
kolb
muttered
audibly
i
should
have
done
better
still
if
i
had
never
come
into
the
world
lucien
answered
kolb
i
don
t
bear
you
any
grudge
for
thinking
as
i
think
myself
tell
david
that
i
was
sorry
i
could
not
bid
him
and
say
that
this
was
my
last
by
the
time
the
alsacien
was
up
and
dressed
lucien
had
shut
the
house
door
and
was
on
his
way
towards
the
charente
by
the
promenade
de
beaulieu
he
might
have
been
going
to
a
festival
for
he
had
put
on
his
new
clothes
from
paris
and
his
dandy
s
trinkets
for
a
drowning
shroud
something
in
lucien
s
tone
had
struck
kolb
at
first
the
man
thought
of
going
to
ask
his
mistress
whether
she
knew
that
her
brother
had
left
the
house
but
as
the
deepest
silence
prevailed
he
concluded
that
the
departure
had
been
arranged
beforehand
and
lay
down
again
and
slept
little
considering
the
gravity
of
the
question
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
suicide
it
has
not
been
studied
perhaps
it
is
a
disease
that
can
not
be
observed
suicide
is
one
effect
of
a
sentiment
which
we
will
call
if
you
will
to
prevent
confusion
by
using
the
word
when
a
man
despises
himself
and
sees
that
others
despise
him
when
real
life
fails
to
fulfil
his
hopes
then
comes
the
moment
when
he
takes
his
life
and
thereby
does
homage
to
society
shorn
of
his
virtues
or
his
splendor
he
does
not
care
to
face
his
fellows
among
atheists
christians
being
without
the
question
of
suicide
among
atheists
whatever
may
be
said
to
the
contrary
none
but
a
base
coward
can
take
up
a
dishonored
life
there
are
three
kinds
of
suicide
the
first
is
only
the
last
and
acute
stage
of
a
long
illness
and
this
kind
belongs
distinctly
to
pathology
the
second
is
the
suicide
of
despair
and
the
third
the
suicide
based
on
logical
argument
despair
and
deductive
reasoning
had
brought
lucien
to
this
pass
but
both
varieties
are
curable
it
is
only
the
pathological
suicide
that
is
inevitable
not
infrequently
you
find
all
three
causes
combined
as
in
the
case
of
rousseau
lucien
having
made
up
his
mind
fell
to
considering
methods
the
poet
would
fain
die
as
became
a
poet
at
first
he
thought
of
throwing
himself
into
the
charente
and
making
an
end
then
and
there
but
as
he
came
down
the
steps
from
beaulieu
for
the
last
time
he
heard
the
whole
town
talking
of
his
suicide
he
saw
the
horrid
sight
of
a
drowned
dead
body
and
thought
of
the
recognition
and
the
inquest
and
like
some
other
suicides
felt
that
vanity
reached
beyond
death
he
remembered
the
day
spent
at
courtois
mill
and
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
round
pool
among
the
willows
that
he
saw
as
he
came
along
by
the
little
river
such
a
pool
as
you
often
find
on
small
streams
with
a
still
smooth
surface
that
conceals
great
depths
beneath
the
water
is
neither
green
nor
blue
nor
white
nor
tawny
it
is
like
a
polished
steel
mirror
no
grows
about
the
margin
there
are
no
blue
water
nor
broad
lily
leaves
the
grass
at
the
brim
is
short
and
thick
and
the
weeping
willows
that
droop
over
the
edge
grow
picturesquely
enough
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
sheer
precipice
beneath
filled
with
water
to
the
brim
any
man
who
should
have
the
courage
to
fill
his
pockets
with
pebbles
would
not
fail
to
find
death
and
never
be
seen
thereafter
at
the
time
while
he
admired
the
lovely
miniature
of
a
landscape
the
poet
had
thought
to
himself
tis
a
spot
to
make
your
mouth
water
for
a
he
thought
of
it
now
as
he
went
down
into
l
houmeau
and
when
he
took
his
way
towards
marsac
with
the
last
sombre
thoughts
gnawing
at
his
heart
it
was
with
the
firm
resolve
to
hide
his
death
there
should
be
no
inquest
held
over
him
he
would
not
be
laid
in
earth
no
one
should
see
him
in
the
hideous
condition
of
the
corpse
that
floats
on
the
surface
of
the
water
before
long
he
reached
one
of
the
slopes
common
enough
on
all
french
highroads
and
commonest
of
all
between
angouleme
and
poitiers
he
saw
the
coach
from
bordeaux
to
paris
coming
up
at
full
speed
behind
him
and
knew
that
the
passengers
would
probably
alight
to
walk
up
the
hill
he
did
not
care
to
be
seen
just
then
turning
off
sharply
into
a
beaten
track
he
began
to
pick
the
flowers
in
a
vineyard
hard
by
when
lucien
came
back
to
the
road
with
a
great
bunch
of
the
yellow
which
grows
everywhere
upon
the
stony
soil
of
the
vineyards
he
came
out
upon
a
traveler
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
the
stranger
wore
powder
there
were
silver
buckles
on
his
shoes
of
orleans
leather
and
his
brown
face
was
scarred
and
seamed
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
fire
in
infancy
the
traveler
so
obviously
clerical
in
his
dress
was
walking
slowly
and
smoking
a
cigar
he
turned
as
lucien
jumped
down
from
the
vineyard
into
the
road
the
deep
melancholy
on
the
handsome
young
face
the
poet
s
symbolical
flowers
and
his
elegant
dress
seemed
to
strike
the
stranger
he
looked
at
lucien
with
something
of
the
expression
of
a
hunter
that
has
found
his
quarry
at
last
after
long
and
fruitless
search
he
allowed
lucien
to
come
alongside
in
nautical
phrase
then
he
slackened
his
pace
and
appeared
to
look
along
the
road
up
the
hill
lucien
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
saw
a
light
traveling
carriage
with
two
horses
and
a
standing
beside
it
you
have
allowed
the
coach
to
pass
you
monsieur
you
will
lose
your
place
unless
you
care
to
take
a
seat
in
my
caleche
and
overtake
the
mail
for
it
is
rather
quicker
traveling
post
than
by
the
public
the
traveler
spoke
with
extreme
politeness
and
a
very
marked
spanish
accent
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
drew
a
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
held
it
out
to
lucien
i
am
not
on
a
journey
said
lucien
and
i
am
too
near
the
end
of
my
stage
to
indulge
in
the
pleasure
of
smoking
you
are
very
severe
with
yourself
returned
the
spaniard
though
i
am
a
canon
of
the
cathedral
of
toledo
i
occasionally
smoke
a
cigarette
god
gave
us
tobacco
to
allay
our
passions
and
our
pains
you
seem
to
be
downcast
or
at
any
rate
you
carry
the
symbolical
flower
of
sorrow
in
your
hand
like
the
rueful
god
hymen
come
all
your
troubles
will
vanish
away
with
the
smoke
and
again
the
ecclesiastic
held
out
his
little
straw
case
there
was
something
fascinating
in
his
manner
and
kindliness
towards
lucien
lighted
up
his
eyes
forgive
me
father
lucien
answered
stiffly
there
is
no
cigar
that
can
scatter
my
tears
came
to
his
eyes
at
the
words
it
must
surely
be
divine
providence
that
prompted
me
to
take
a
little
exercise
to
shake
off
a
traveler
s
morning
drowsiness
said
the
churchman
a
divine
prompting
to
fulfil
my
mission
here
on
earth
by
consoling
what
great
trouble
can
you
have
at
your
age
your
consolations
father
can
do
nothing
for
me
you
are
a
spaniard
i
am
a
frenchman
you
believe
in
the
commandments
of
the
church
i
am
an
virgen
del
you
are
an
atheist
cried
the
other
laying
a
hand
on
lucien
s
arm
with
maternal
solicitude
ah
here
is
one
of
the
curious
things
i
promised
myself
to
see
in
paris
we
in
spain
do
not
believe
in
atheists
there
is
no
country
but
france
where
one
can
have
such
opinions
at
nineteen
oh
i
am
an
atheist
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
i
have
no
belief
in
god
in
society
in
happiness
take
a
good
look
at
me
father
for
in
a
few
hours
time
life
will
be
over
for
me
my
last
sun
has
risen
said
lucien
with
a
sort
of
rhetorical
effect
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
sky
how
so
what
have
you
done
that
you
must
die
who
has
condemned
you
to
die
a
tribunal
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
i
you
child
cried
the
priest
have
you
killed
a
man
is
the
scaffold
waiting
for
you
let
us
reason
together
a
little
if
you
are
resolved
as
you
say
to
return
to
nothingness
everything
on
earth
is
indifferent
to
you
is
it
not
lucien
bowed
assent
very
well
then
can
you
not
tell
me
about
your
troubles
some
little
affair
of
the
heart
has
taken
a
bad
turn
no
doubt
lucien
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
significantly
are
you
resolved
to
kill
yourself
to
escape
dishonor
or
do
you
despair
of
life
very
good
you
can
kill
yourself
at
poitiers
quite
as
easily
as
at
angouleme
and
at
tours
it
will
be
no
harder
than
at
poitiers
the
quicksands
of
the
loire
never
give
up
their
prey
no
father
said
lucien
i
have
settled
it
all
not
three
weeks
ago
i
chanced
upon
the
most
charming
raft
that
can
ferry
a
man
sick
and
tired
of
this
life
into
the
other
world
the
other
world
you
are
not
an
oh
by
another
world
i
mean
my
next
transformation
animal
or
have
you
some
incurable
disease
yes
ah
now
we
come
to
the
point
what
is
it
the
priest
looked
at
lucien
the
diamond
does
not
know
its
own
value
he
said
and
there
was
an
inexpressible
charm
and
a
touch
of
something
like
irony
in
his
smile
none
but
a
priest
could
flatter
a
poor
man
about
to
die
exclaimed
lucien
you
are
not
going
to
die
the
spaniard
returned
authoritatively
i
have
heard
many
times
of
men
that
were
robbed
on
the
highroad
but
i
have
never
yet
heard
of
one
that
found
a
fortune
there
said
lucien
you
will
hear
of
one
now
said
the
priest
glancing
towards
the
carriage
to
measure
the
time
still
left
for
their
walk
together
listen
to
me
he
continued
with
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
if
you
are
poor
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
die
i
need
a
secretary
for
mine
has
just
died
at
barcelona
i
am
in
the
same
position
as
the
famous
baron
goertz
minister
of
charles
xii
he
was
traveling
toward
sweden
just
as
i
am
going
to
paris
and
in
some
little
town
or
other
he
chanced
upon
the
son
of
a
goldsmith
a
young
man
of
remarkable
good
looks
though
they
could
scarcely
equal
yours
baron
goertz
discerned
intelligence
in
the
young
man
just
as
i
see
poetry
on
your
brow
he
took
him
into
his
traveling
carriage
as
i
shall
take
you
very
shortly
and
of
a
boy
condemned
to
spend
his
days
in
burnishing
spoons
and
forks
and
making
trinkets
in
some
little
town
like
angouleme
he
made
a
favorite
as
you
shall
be
mine
arrived
at
stockholm
he
installed
his
secretary
and
overwhelmed
him
with
work
the
young
man
spent
his
nights
in
writing
and
like
all
great
workers
he
contracted
a
bad
habit
a
trick
he
took
to
chewing
paper
the
late
de
malesherbes
use
to
rap
people
over
the
knuckles
and
he
did
this
once
by
the
by
to
somebody
or
other
whose
suit
depended
upon
him
the
handsome
young
secretary
began
by
chewing
blank
paper
found
it
insipid
for
a
while
and
acquired
a
taste
for
manuscript
as
having
more
flavor
people
did
not
smoke
as
yet
in
those
days
at
last
from
flavor
to
flavor
he
began
to
chew
parchment
and
swallow
it
now
at
that
time
a
treaty
was
being
negotiated
between
russia
and
sweden
the
insisted
that
charles
xii
should
make
peace
much
as
they
tried
in
france
to
make
napoleon
treat
for
peace
in
and
the
basis
of
these
negotiations
was
the
treaty
between
the
two
powers
with
regard
to
finland
goertz
gave
the
original
into
his
secretary
s
keeping
but
when
the
time
came
for
laying
the
draft
before
the
a
trifling
difficulty
arose
the
treaty
was
not
to
be
found
the
believed
that
the
minister
pandering
to
the
king
s
wishes
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
get
rid
of
the
document
baron
goertz
was
in
fact
accused
of
this
and
the
secretary
owned
that
he
had
eaten
the
treaty
he
was
tried
and
convicted
and
condemned
to
but
you
have
not
come
to
that
yet
so
take
a
cigar
and
smoke
till
we
reach
the
lucien
took
a
cigar
and
lit
it
spanish
fashion
at
the
priest
s
cigar
he
is
right
he
thought
i
can
take
my
life
at
any
it
often
happens
that
a
young
man
s
fortunes
take
a
turn
when
despair
is
darkest
the
spaniard
continued
that
is
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
but
i
preferred
to
prove
it
by
a
case
in
point
here
was
the
handsome
young
secretary
lying
under
sentence
of
death
and
his
case
the
more
desperate
because
as
he
had
been
condemned
by
the
the
king
could
not
pardon
him
but
he
connived
at
his
escape
the
secretary
stole
away
in
a
with
a
few
crowns
in
his
pocket
and
reached
the
court
of
courland
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
goertz
explaining
his
secretary
s
adventures
and
his
craze
for
paper
the
duke
of
courland
was
a
spendthrift
he
had
a
steward
and
a
pretty
wife
three
several
causes
of
ruin
he
placed
the
charming
young
stranger
with
his
steward
if
you
can
imagine
that
the
sometime
secretary
had
been
cured
of
his
depraved
taste
by
a
sentence
of
death
you
do
not
know
the
grip
that
a
man
s
failings
have
upon
him
let
a
man
discover
some
satisfaction
for
himself
and
the
headsman
will
not
keep
him
from
how
is
it
that
the
vice
has
this
power
is
it
inherent
strength
in
the
vice
or
inherent
weakness
in
human
nature
are
there
certain
tastes
that
should
be
regarded
as
verging
on
insanity
for
myself
i
can
not
help
laughing
at
the
moralists
who
try
to
expel
such
diseases
by
fine
well
it
so
fell
out
that
the
steward
refused
a
demand
for
money
and
the
duke
taking
fright
at
this
called
for
an
audit
sheer
imbecility
nothing
easier
than
to
make
out
a
the
difficulty
never
lies
there
the
steward
gave
his
secretary
all
the
necessary
documents
for
compiling
a
schedule
of
the
civil
list
of
courland
he
had
nearly
finished
it
when
in
the
dead
of
night
the
unhappy
discovered
that
he
was
chewing
up
one
of
the
duke
s
discharges
for
a
considerable
sum
he
had
eaten
half
the
signature
horror
seized
upon
him
he
fled
to
the
duchess
flung
himself
at
her
feet
told
her
of
his
craze
and
implored
the
aid
of
his
sovereign
lady
implored
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
handsome
young
face
made
such
an
impression
on
the
duchess
that
she
married
him
as
soon
as
she
was
left
a
widow
and
so
in
the
century
in
a
land
where
the
is
king
the
goldsmith
s
son
became
a
prince
and
something
more
on
the
death
of
catherine
he
was
regent
he
ruled
the
empress
anne
and
tried
to
be
the
richelieu
of
russia
very
well
young
man
now
know
this
if
you
are
handsomer
than
biron
i
simple
canon
that
i
am
am
worth
more
than
a
baron
goertz
so
get
in
we
will
find
a
duchy
of
courland
for
you
in
paris
or
failing
the
duchy
we
shall
certainly
find
the
the
spanish
priest
laid
a
hand
on
lucien
s
arm
and
literally
forced
him
into
the
traveling
carriage
the
postilion
shut
the
door
now
speak
i
am
listening
said
the
canon
of
toledo
to
lucien
s
bewilderment
i
am
an
old
priest
you
can
tell
me
everything
there
is
nothing
to
fear
so
far
we
have
only
run
through
our
patrimony
or
squandered
mamma
s
money
we
have
made
a
flitting
from
our
creditors
and
we
are
honor
personified
down
to
the
tips
of
our
elegant
little
boots
come
confess
boldly
it
will
be
just
as
if
you
were
talking
to
lucien
felt
like
that
hero
of
an
eastern
tale
the
fisher
who
tried
to
drown
himself
in
and
sank
down
to
find
himself
a
king
of
countries
under
the
sea
the
spanish
priest
seemed
so
really
affectionate
that
the
poet
hesitated
no
longer
between
angouleme
and
ruffec
he
told
the
story
of
his
whole
life
omitting
none
of
his
misdeeds
and
ended
with
the
final
catastrophe
which
he
had
brought
about
the
tale
only
gained
in
poetic
charm
because
this
was
the
third
time
he
had
told
it
in
the
past
fortnight
just
as
he
made
an
end
they
passed
the
house
of
the
rastignac
family
young
rastignac
left
that
place
for
paris
said
lucien
he
is
certainly
not
my
equal
but
he
has
had
better
the
spaniard
started
at
the
name
oh
he
said
yes
that
shy
little
place
belongs
to
his
father
as
i
was
telling
you
just
now
he
was
the
lover
of
mme
de
nucingen
the
famous
banker
s
wife
i
drifted
into
poetry
he
was
cleverer
he
took
the
practical
the
priest
stopped
the
caleche
and
was
so
far
curious
as
to
walk
down
the
little
avenue
that
led
to
the
house
showing
more
interest
in
the
place
than
lucien
expected
from
a
spanish
ecclesiastic
then
do
you
know
the
rastignacs
asked
lucien
i
know
every
one
in
paris
said
the
spaniard
taking
his
place
again
in
the
carriage
and
so
for
want
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
you
were
about
to
take
your
life
you
are
a
child
you
know
neither
men
nor
things
a
man
s
future
is
worth
the
value
that
he
chooses
to
set
upon
it
and
you
value
yours
at
twelve
thousand
francs
well
i
will
give
more
than
that
for
you
any
time
as
for
your
s
imprisonment
it
is
the
merest
trifle
if
this
dear
sechard
has
made
a
discovery
he
will
be
a
rich
man
some
day
and
a
rich
man
has
never
been
imprisoned
for
debt
you
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
strong
in
history
history
is
of
two
kinds
there
is
the
official
history
taught
in
schools
a
lying
compilation
usum
and
there
is
the
secret
history
which
deals
with
the
real
causes
of
events
a
scandalous
chronicle
let
me
tell
you
briefly
a
little
story
which
you
have
not
heard
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
man
young
and
ambitious
and
a
priest
to
boot
he
wanted
to
enter
upon
a
political
career
so
he
fawned
on
the
queen
s
favorite
the
favorite
took
an
interest
in
him
gave
him
the
rank
of
minister
and
a
seat
at
the
council
board
one
evening
somebody
wrote
to
the
young
aspirant
thinking
to
do
him
a
service
never
do
a
service
by
the
by
unless
you
are
asked
and
told
him
that
his
benefactor
s
life
was
in
danger
the
king
s
wrath
was
kindled
against
his
rival
if
the
favorite
went
to
the
palace
he
would
certainly
be
stabbed
so
said
the
letter
well
now
young
man
what
would
you
have
done
i
should
have
gone
at
once
to
warn
my
benefactor
lucien
exclaimed
quickly
you
are
indeed
the
child
which
your
story
reveals
said
the
priest
our
man
said
to
himself
if
the
king
is
resolved
to
go
to
such
lengths
it
is
all
over
with
my
benefactor
i
must
receive
this
letter
too
late
so
he
slept
on
till
the
favorite
was
stabbed
he
was
a
monster
said
lucien
suspecting
that
the
priest
meant
to
sound
him
so
are
all
great
men
this
one
was
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
and
his
benefactor
was
the
marechal
d
ancre
you
really
do
not
know
your
history
of
france
you
see
was
i
not
right
when
i
told
you
that
history
as
taught
in
schools
is
simply
a
collection
of
facts
and
dates
more
than
doubtful
in
the
first
place
and
with
no
bearing
whatever
on
the
gist
of
the
matter
you
are
told
that
such
a
person
as
jeanne
darc
once
existed
where
is
the
use
of
that
have
you
never
drawn
your
own
conclusions
from
that
fact
never
seen
that
if
france
had
accepted
the
angevin
dynasty
of
the
plantagenets
the
two
peoples
thus
reunited
would
be
ruling
the
world
and
the
islands
that
now
brew
political
storms
for
the
continent
would
be
french
provinces
why
have
you
so
much
as
studied
the
means
by
which
simple
merchants
like
the
medicis
became
grand
dukes
of
tuscany
a
poet
in
france
is
not
bound
to
be
as
learned
as
a
benedictine
said
lucien
well
they
became
as
richelieu
became
a
minister
if
you
had
looked
into
history
for
the
causes
of
events
instead
of
getting
the
headings
by
heart
you
would
have
found
precepts
for
your
guidance
in
this
life
these
real
facts
taken
at
random
from
among
so
many
supply
you
with
the
axiom
look
upon
men
and
on
women
most
of
all
as
your
instruments
but
never
let
them
see
if
some
one
higher
in
place
can
be
useful
to
you
worship
him
as
your
god
and
never
leave
him
until
he
has
paid
the
price
of
your
servility
to
the
last
farthing
in
your
intercourse
with
men
in
short
be
grasping
and
mean
as
a
jew
all
that
the
jew
does
for
money
you
must
do
for
power
and
besides
all
this
when
a
man
has
fallen
from
power
care
no
more
for
him
than
if
he
had
ceased
to
exist
and
do
you
ask
why
you
must
do
these
things
you
mean
to
rule
the
world
do
you
not
you
must
begin
by
obeying
and
studying
it
scholars
study
books
politicians
study
men
and
their
interests
and
the
springs
of
action
society
and
mankind
in
masses
are
fatalists
they
bow
down
and
worship
the
accomplished
fact
do
you
know
why
i
am
giving
you
this
little
history
lesson
it
seems
to
me
that
your
ambition
is
boundless
yes
i
saw
that
myself
said
the
priest
but
at
this
moment
you
are
thinking
here
is
this
spanish
canon
inventing
anecdotes
and
straining
history
to
prove
to
me
that
i
have
too
much
virtue
lucien
began
to
smile
his
thoughts
had
been
read
so
clearly
very
well
let
us
take
facts
that
every
schoolboy
knows
one
day
france
is
almost
entirely
overrun
by
the
english
the
king
has
only
a
single
province
left
two
figures
arise
from
among
the
people
a
poor
herd
girl
that
very
jeanne
darc
of
whom
we
were
speaking
and
a
burgher
named
jacques
coeur
the
girl
brings
the
power
of
virginity
the
strength
of
her
arm
the
burgher
gives
his
gold
and
the
kingdom
is
saved
the
maid
is
taken
prisoner
and
the
king
who
could
have
ransomed
her
leaves
her
to
be
burned
alive
the
king
allows
his
courtier
to
accuse
the
great
burgher
of
capital
crime
and
they
rob
him
and
divide
all
his
wealth
among
themselves
the
spoils
of
an
innocent
man
hunted
down
brought
to
bay
and
driven
into
exile
by
the
law
went
to
enrich
five
noble
houses
and
the
father
of
the
archbishop
of
bourges
left
the
kingdom
for
ever
without
one
sou
of
all
his
possessions
in
france
and
no
resource
but
moneys
remitted
to
arabs
and
saracens
in
egypt
it
is
open
to
you
to
say
that
these
examples
are
out
of
date
that
three
centuries
of
public
education
have
since
elapsed
and
that
the
outlines
of
those
ages
are
more
or
less
dim
figures
well
young
man
do
you
believe
in
the
last
of
france
in
napoleon
one
of
his
generals
was
in
disgrace
all
through
his
career
napoleon
made
him
a
marshal
grudgingly
and
never
sent
him
on
service
if
he
could
help
it
that
marshal
was
kellermann
do
you
know
the
reason
of
the
grudge
kellermann
saved
france
and
the
first
consul
at
marengo
by
a
brilliant
charge
the
ranks
applauded
under
fire
and
in
the
thick
of
the
carnage
that
heroic
charge
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
bulletin
napoleon
s
coolness
toward
kellermann
fouche
s
fall
and
talleyrand
s
disgrace
were
all
attributable
to
the
same
cause
it
is
the
ingratitude
of
a
charles
or
a
richelieu
or
but
father
said
lucien
suppose
that
you
should
save
my
life
and
make
my
fortune
you
are
making
the
ties
of
gratitude
somewhat
little
rogue
said
the
abbe
smiling
as
he
pinched
lucien
s
ear
with
an
almost
royal
familiarity
if
you
are
ungrateful
to
me
it
will
be
because
you
are
a
strong
man
and
i
shall
bend
before
you
but
you
are
not
that
just
yet
as
a
simple
prentice
you
have
tried
to
be
master
too
soon
the
common
fault
of
frenchmen
of
your
generation
napoleon
s
example
has
spoiled
them
all
you
send
in
your
resignation
because
you
have
not
the
pair
of
epaulettes
that
you
fancied
but
have
you
attempted
to
bring
the
full
force
of
your
will
and
every
action
of
your
life
to
bear
upon
your
one
idea
alas
you
have
been
inconsistent
as
the
english
say
smiled
the
canon
what
i
have
been
matters
nothing
now
said
lucien
if
i
can
be
nothing
in
the
if
at
the
back
of
all
your
good
qualities
there
is
power
continued
the
priest
not
averse
to
show
that
he
had
a
little
latin
nothing
in
this
world
can
resist
you
i
have
taken
enough
of
a
liking
for
you
already
lucien
smiled
incredulously
yes
said
the
priest
in
answer
to
the
smile
you
interest
me
as
much
as
if
you
had
been
my
son
and
i
am
strong
enough
to
afford
to
talk
to
you
as
openly
as
you
have
just
done
to
me
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
i
like
about
you
this
you
have
made
a
sort
of
within
yourself
and
are
ready
to
hear
a
sermon
on
morality
that
you
will
hear
nowhere
else
for
mankind
in
the
mass
are
even
more
consummate
hypocrites
than
any
one
individual
can
be
when
his
interests
demand
a
piece
of
acting
most
of
us
spend
a
good
part
of
our
lives
in
clearing
our
minds
of
the
notions
that
sprang
up
unchecked
during
our
nonage
this
is
called
getting
our
lucien
listening
thought
within
himself
here
is
some
old
intriguer
delighted
with
a
chance
of
amusing
himself
on
a
journey
he
is
pleased
with
the
idea
of
bringing
about
a
change
of
opinion
in
a
poor
wretch
on
the
brink
of
suicide
and
when
he
is
tired
of
his
amusement
he
will
drop
me
still
he
understands
paradox
and
seems
to
be
quite
a
match
for
blondet
or
but
in
spite
of
these
sage
reflections
the
diplomate
s
poison
had
sunk
deeply
into
lucien
s
soul
the
ground
was
ready
to
receive
it
and
the
havoc
wrought
was
the
greater
because
such
famous
examples
were
cited
lucien
fell
under
the
charm
of
his
companion
s
cynical
talk
and
clung
the
more
willingly
to
life
because
he
felt
that
this
arm
which
drew
him
up
from
the
depths
was
a
strong
one
in
this
respect
the
ecclesiastic
had
evidently
won
the
day
and
indeed
from
time
to
time
a
malicious
smile
bore
his
cynical
anecdotes
company
if
your
system
of
morality
at
all
resembles
your
manner
of
regarding
history
said
lucien
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
the
motive
of
your
present
act
of
charity
for
such
it
seems
to
there
young
man
i
have
come
to
the
last
head
of
my
sermon
you
will
permit
me
to
reserve
it
for
in
that
case
we
shall
not
part
company
said
the
canon
with
the
tact
of
the
priest
who
sees
that
his
guile
has
succeeded
very
well
talk
morality
said
lucien
to
himself
he
said
i
will
draw
him
morality
begins
with
the
law
said
the
priest
if
it
were
simply
a
question
of
religion
laws
would
be
superfluous
religious
peoples
have
few
laws
the
laws
of
statecraft
are
above
civil
law
well
do
you
care
to
know
the
inscription
which
a
politician
can
read
written
at
large
over
your
nineteenth
century
in
the
french
invented
the
idea
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
came
to
an
end
under
the
absolute
ruler
in
the
emperor
so
much
for
your
history
as
a
nation
now
for
your
private
manners
mme
tallien
and
mme
beauharnais
both
acted
alike
napoleon
married
the
one
and
made
her
your
empress
the
other
he
would
never
receive
at
court
princess
though
she
was
the
of
takes
the
iron
crown
in
the
fanatical
lovers
of
equality
or
death
conspire
fourteen
years
afterwards
with
a
legitimist
aristocracy
to
bring
back
louis
xviii
and
that
same
aristocracy
lording
it
in
the
faubourg
has
done
worse
has
been
merchant
usurer
farmer
and
shepherd
so
in
france
systems
political
and
moral
have
started
from
one
point
and
reached
another
diametrically
opposed
and
men
have
expressed
one
kind
of
opinion
and
acted
on
another
there
has
been
no
consistency
in
national
policy
nor
in
the
conduct
of
individuals
you
can
not
be
said
to
have
any
morality
left
success
is
the
supreme
justification
of
all
actions
whatsoever
the
fact
in
itself
is
nothing
the
impression
that
it
makes
upon
others
is
everything
hence
please
observe
a
second
precept
present
a
fair
exterior
to
the
world
keep
the
seamy
side
of
life
to
yourself
and
turn
a
resplendent
countenance
upon
others
discretion
the
motto
of
every
ambitious
man
is
the
watchword
of
our
order
take
it
for
your
own
great
men
are
guilty
of
almost
as
many
base
deeds
as
poor
outcasts
but
they
are
careful
to
do
these
things
in
shadow
and
to
parade
their
virtues
in
the
light
or
they
would
not
be
great
men
your
insignificant
man
leaves
his
virtues
in
the
shade
he
publicly
displays
his
pitiable
side
and
is
despised
accordingly
you
for
instance
have
hidden
your
titles
to
greatness
and
made
a
display
of
your
worst
failings
you
openly
took
an
actress
for
your
mistress
lived
with
her
and
upon
her
you
were
by
no
means
to
blame
for
this
everybody
admitted
that
both
of
you
were
perfectly
free
to
do
as
you
liked
but
you
ran
full
tilt
against
the
ideas
of
the
world
and
the
world
has
not
shown
you
the
consideration
that
is
shown
to
those
who
obey
the
rules
of
the
game
if
you
had
left
coralie
to
this
camusot
if
you
had
hidden
your
relations
with
her
you
might
have
married
mme
de
bargeton
you
would
now
be
prefect
of
angouleme
and
marquis
de
rubempre
change
your
tactics
bring
your
good
looks
your
charm
your
wit
your
poetry
to
the
front
if
you
indulge
in
small
discreditable
courses
let
it
be
within
four
walls
and
you
will
never
again
be
guilty
of
a
blot
on
the
decorations
of
this
great
theatrical
scene
called
society
napoleon
called
this
washing
dirty
linen
at
the
corollary
follows
naturally
on
this
second
precept
form
is
everything
be
careful
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
that
word
there
are
people
who
for
want
of
knowing
better
will
help
themselves
to
money
under
pressure
of
want
and
take
it
by
force
these
people
are
called
criminals
and
perforce
they
square
accounts
with
justice
a
poor
man
of
genius
discovers
some
secret
some
invention
as
good
as
a
treasure
you
lend
him
three
thousand
francs
for
that
practically
the
cointets
have
done
they
hold
your
bills
and
they
are
about
to
rob
your
you
torment
him
until
he
reveals
or
partly
reveals
his
secret
you
settle
your
accounts
with
your
own
conscience
and
your
conscience
does
not
drag
you
into
the
assize
court
the
enemies
of
social
order
beholding
this
contrast
take
occasion
to
yap
at
justice
and
wax
wroth
in
the
name
of
the
people
because
forsooth
burglars
and
are
sent
to
the
hulks
while
a
man
who
brings
whole
families
to
ruin
by
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
is
let
off
with
a
few
months
imprisonment
but
these
hypocrites
know
quite
well
that
the
judge
who
passes
sentence
on
the
thief
is
maintaining
the
barrier
set
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
and
that
if
that
barrier
were
overturned
social
chaos
would
ensue
while
in
the
case
of
the
bankrupt
the
man
who
steals
an
inheritance
cleverly
and
the
banker
who
slaughters
a
business
for
his
own
benefit
money
merely
changes
hands
that
is
all
society
my
son
is
bound
to
draw
those
distinctions
which
i
have
pointed
out
for
your
benefit
the
one
great
point
is
this
you
must
be
a
match
for
society
napoleon
richelieu
and
the
medicis
were
a
match
for
their
generations
and
as
for
you
you
value
yourself
at
twelve
thousand
francs
you
of
this
generation
in
france
worship
the
golden
calf
what
else
is
the
religion
of
your
charter
that
will
not
recognize
a
man
politically
unless
he
owns
property
what
is
this
but
the
command
strive
to
be
rich
some
day
when
you
shall
have
made
a
fortune
without
breaking
the
law
you
will
be
rich
you
will
be
the
marquis
de
rubempre
and
you
can
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
honor
you
will
be
so
extremely
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
that
no
one
will
dare
to
accuse
you
of
past
shortcomings
if
in
the
process
of
making
your
way
you
should
happen
to
smirch
it
now
and
again
which
i
myself
should
never
advise
he
added
patting
lucien
s
hand
so
what
must
you
put
in
that
comely
head
of
yours
simply
this
and
nothing
more
propose
to
yourself
a
brilliant
and
conspicuous
goal
and
go
towards
it
secretly
let
no
one
see
your
methods
or
your
progress
you
have
behaved
like
a
child
be
a
man
be
a
hunter
lie
in
wait
for
your
quarry
in
the
world
of
paris
wait
for
your
chance
and
your
game
you
need
not
be
particular
nor
mindful
of
your
dignity
as
it
is
called
we
are
all
of
us
slaves
to
something
to
some
failing
of
our
own
or
to
necessity
but
keep
that
law
of
laws
father
you
frighten
me
said
lucien
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
highwayman
s
and
you
are
right
said
the
canon
but
it
is
no
invention
of
mine
all
reason
in
this
way
the
house
of
austria
and
the
house
of
france
alike
you
have
nothing
you
say
the
medicis
richelieu
and
napoleon
started
from
precisely
your
standpoint
but
my
child
considered
that
their
prospects
were
worth
ingratitude
treachery
and
the
most
glaring
inconsistencies
you
must
dare
all
things
to
gain
all
things
let
us
discuss
it
suppose
that
you
sit
down
to
a
game
of
do
you
begin
to
argue
over
the
rules
of
the
game
there
they
are
you
accept
come
now
thought
lucien
he
can
play
and
what
do
you
do
continued
the
priest
do
you
practise
openness
that
fairest
of
virtues
not
merely
do
you
hide
your
tactics
but
you
do
your
best
to
make
others
believe
that
you
are
on
the
brink
of
ruin
as
soon
as
you
are
sure
of
winning
the
game
in
short
you
dissemble
do
you
not
you
lie
to
win
four
or
five
louis
d
or
what
would
you
think
of
a
player
so
generous
as
to
proclaim
that
he
held
a
hand
full
of
trumps
very
well
the
ambitious
man
who
carries
virtue
s
precepts
into
the
arena
when
his
antagonists
have
left
them
behind
is
behaving
like
a
child
old
men
of
the
world
might
say
to
him
as
would
say
to
the
man
who
declines
to
take
advantage
of
his
trumps
monsieur
you
ought
not
to
play
at
did
you
make
the
rules
of
the
game
of
ambition
why
did
i
tell
you
to
be
a
match
for
society
because
in
these
days
society
by
degrees
has
usurped
so
many
rights
over
the
individual
that
the
individual
is
compelled
to
act
in
there
is
no
question
of
laws
now
their
place
has
been
taken
by
custom
which
is
to
say
grimacings
and
forms
must
always
be
lucien
started
with
surprise
ah
my
child
said
the
priest
afraid
that
he
had
shocked
lucien
s
innocence
did
you
expect
to
find
the
angel
gabriel
in
an
abbe
loaded
with
all
the
iniquities
of
the
diplomacy
and
of
two
kings
i
am
an
agent
between
ferdinand
vii
and
louis
two
kings
who
owe
their
crowns
to
profound
er
combinations
let
us
say
i
believe
in
god
but
i
have
a
still
greater
belief
in
our
order
and
our
order
has
no
belief
save
in
temporal
power
in
order
to
strengthen
and
consolidate
the
temporal
power
our
order
upholds
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
which
is
to
say
the
doctrines
which
dispose
the
world
at
large
to
obedience
we
are
the
templars
of
modern
times
we
have
a
doctrine
of
our
own
like
the
templars
we
have
been
dispersed
and
for
the
same
reasons
we
are
almost
a
match
for
the
world
if
you
will
enlist
as
a
soldier
i
will
be
your
captain
obey
me
as
a
wife
obeys
her
husband
as
a
child
obeys
his
mother
and
i
will
guarantee
that
you
shall
be
marquis
de
rubempre
in
less
than
six
months
you
shall
marry
into
one
of
the
proudest
houses
in
the
faubourg
and
some
day
you
shall
sit
on
a
bench
with
peers
of
france
what
would
you
have
been
at
this
moment
if
i
had
not
amused
you
by
my
conversation
an
undiscovered
corpse
in
a
deep
bed
of
mud
well
and
good
now
for
an
effort
of
imagination
lucien
looked
curiously
at
his
protector
here
in
this
caleche
beside
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
canon
of
toledo
secret
envoy
from
his
majesty
ferdinand
vii
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
france
bearer
of
a
despatch
thus
worded
it
may
be
when
you
have
delivered
me
hang
all
those
whom
i
favor
at
this
moment
more
especially
the
bearer
of
this
despatch
for
then
he
can
tell
no
tales
well
beside
this
envoy
sits
a
young
man
who
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
poet
recently
deceased
i
have
fished
you
out
of
the
water
i
have
brought
you
to
life
again
you
belong
to
me
as
the
creature
belongs
to
the
creator
as
the
efrits
of
fairytales
belong
to
the
genii
as
the
janissary
to
the
sultan
as
the
soul
to
the
body
i
will
sustain
you
in
the
way
to
power
with
a
strong
hand
and
at
the
same
time
i
promise
that
your
life
shall
be
a
continual
course
of
pleasure
honors
and
enjoyment
you
shall
never
want
for
money
you
shall
shine
you
shall
go
bravely
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
while
i
crouching
in
the
mud
will
lay
a
firm
foundation
for
the
brilliant
edifice
of
your
fortunes
for
i
love
power
for
its
own
sake
i
shall
always
rejoice
in
your
enjoyment
forbidden
to
me
in
short
my
self
shall
become
your
self
well
if
a
day
should
come
when
this
pact
between
man
and
the
tempter
this
agreement
between
the
child
and
the
diplomatist
should
no
longer
suit
your
ideas
you
can
still
look
about
for
some
quiet
spot
like
that
pool
of
which
you
were
speaking
and
drown
yourself
you
will
only
be
as
you
are
now
or
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
wretched
and
this
is
not
like
the
archbishop
of
granada
s
homily
said
lucien
as
they
stopped
to
change
horses
call
this
concentrated
education
by
what
name
you
will
my
son
for
you
are
my
son
i
adopt
you
henceforth
and
shall
make
you
my
heir
it
is
the
code
of
ambition
god
s
elect
are
few
and
far
between
there
is
no
choice
you
must
bury
yourself
in
the
cloister
and
there
you
very
often
find
the
world
again
in
miniature
or
accept
the
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
be
so
wise
said
lucien
trying
to
fathom
this
terrible
priest
what
rejoined
the
canon
you
begin
to
play
before
you
know
the
rules
of
the
game
and
now
you
throw
it
up
just
as
your
chances
are
best
and
you
have
a
substantial
godfather
to
back
you
and
you
do
not
even
care
to
play
a
return
match
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
have
no
mind
to
be
even
with
those
who
drove
you
from
paris
lucien
quivered
the
sounds
that
rang
through
every
nerve
seemed
to
come
from
some
bronze
instrument
some
chinese
gong
i
am
only
a
poor
priest
returned
his
mentor
and
a
grim
expression
dreadful
to
behold
appeared
for
a
moment
on
a
face
burned
to
a
by
the
sun
of
spain
i
am
only
a
poor
priest
but
if
i
had
been
humiliated
vexed
tormented
betrayed
and
sold
as
you
have
been
by
the
scoundrels
of
whom
you
have
told
me
i
should
do
like
an
arab
of
the
desert
i
would
devote
myself
body
and
soul
to
vengeance
i
might
end
by
dangling
from
a
gibbet
garroted
impaled
guillotined
in
your
french
fashion
i
should
not
care
a
rap
but
they
should
not
have
my
head
until
i
had
crushed
my
enemies
under
my
lucien
was
silent
he
had
no
wish
to
draw
the
priest
out
any
further
some
are
descended
from
cain
and
some
from
abel
the
canon
concluded
i
myself
am
of
mixed
blood
cain
for
my
enemies
abel
for
my
friends
woe
to
him
that
shall
awaken
cain
after
all
you
are
a
frenchman
i
am
a
spaniard
and
what
is
more
a
what
a
tartar
thought
lucien
scanning
the
protector
thus
sent
to
him
by
heaven
there
was
no
sign
of
the
jesuit
nor
even
of
the
ecclesiastic
about
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
his
hands
were
large
he
was
and
evidently
he
possessed
the
strength
of
a
hercules
his
terrific
expression
was
softened
by
benignity
assumed
at
will
but
a
complexion
of
impenetrable
bronze
inspired
feelings
of
repulsion
rather
than
attachment
for
the
man
the
strange
diplomatist
looked
somewhat
like
a
bishop
for
he
wore
powder
on
his
long
thick
hair
after
the
fashion
of
the
prince
de
talleyrand
a
gold
cross
hanging
from
a
strip
of
blue
ribbon
with
a
white
border
indicated
an
ecclesiastical
dignitary
the
outlines
beneath
the
black
silk
stockings
would
not
have
disgraced
an
athlete
the
exquisite
neatness
of
his
clothes
and
person
revealed
an
amount
of
care
which
a
simple
priest
and
above
all
a
spanish
priest
does
not
always
take
with
his
appearance
a
hat
lay
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
which
bore
the
arms
of
spain
in
spite
of
the
sense
of
repulsion
the
effect
made
by
the
man
s
appearance
was
weakened
by
his
manner
fierce
and
yet
winning
as
it
was
he
evidently
laid
himself
out
to
please
lucien
and
the
winning
manner
became
almost
coaxing
yet
lucien
noticed
the
smallest
trifles
uneasily
he
felt
that
the
moment
of
decision
had
come
they
had
reached
the
second
stage
beyond
ruffec
and
the
decision
meant
life
or
death
the
spaniard
s
last
words
vibrated
through
many
chords
in
his
heart
and
to
the
shame
of
both
it
must
be
said
that
all
that
was
worst
in
lucien
responded
to
an
appeal
deliberately
made
to
his
evil
impulses
and
the
eyes
that
studied
the
poet
s
beautiful
face
had
read
him
very
clearly
lucien
beheld
paris
once
more
in
imagination
he
caught
again
at
the
reins
of
power
let
fall
from
his
unskilled
hands
and
he
avenged
himself
the
comparisons
which
he
himself
had
drawn
so
lately
between
the
life
of
paris
and
life
in
the
provinces
faded
from
his
mind
with
the
more
painful
motives
for
suicide
he
was
about
to
return
to
his
natural
sphere
and
this
time
with
a
protector
a
political
intriguer
unscrupulous
as
cromwell
i
was
alone
now
there
will
be
two
of
us
he
told
himself
and
then
this
priest
had
been
more
and
more
interested
as
he
told
of
his
sins
one
after
another
the
man
s
charity
had
grown
with
the
extent
of
his
misdoings
nothing
had
astonished
this
confessor
and
yet
what
could
be
the
motive
of
a
mover
in
the
intrigues
of
kings
lucien
at
first
was
fain
to
be
content
with
the
banal
answer
the
spanish
are
a
generous
race
the
spaniard
is
generous
even
so
the
italian
is
jealous
and
a
poisoner
the
frenchman
fickle
the
german
frank
the
jew
ignoble
and
the
englishman
noble
reverse
these
verdicts
and
you
shall
arrive
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
truth
the
jews
have
monopolized
the
gold
of
the
world
they
compose
the
act
sing
give
commissions
for
pictures
and
build
palaces
write
and
wonderful
verse
they
are
more
powerful
than
ever
their
religion
is
accepted
they
have
lent
money
to
the
holy
father
himself
as
for
germany
a
foreigner
is
often
asked
whether
he
has
a
contract
in
writing
and
this
is
in
the
smallest
matters
so
tricky
are
they
in
their
dealings
in
france
the
spectacle
of
national
blunders
has
never
lacked
national
applause
for
the
past
fifty
years
we
continue
to
wear
hats
which
no
mortal
can
explain
and
every
change
of
government
is
made
on
the
express
condition
that
things
shall
remain
exactly
as
they
were
before
england
flaunts
her
perfidy
in
the
face
of
the
world
and
her
abominable
treachery
is
only
equaled
by
her
greed
all
the
gold
of
two
indies
passed
through
the
hands
of
spain
and
now
she
has
nothing
left
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
poison
is
so
little
in
request
as
in
italy
no
country
where
manners
are
easier
or
more
gentle
as
for
the
spaniard
he
has
traded
largely
on
the
reputation
of
the
moor
as
the
canon
of
toledo
returned
to
the
caleche
he
had
spoken
a
word
to
the
drive
he
said
and
there
will
be
three
francs
for
for
then
seeing
that
lucien
hesitated
come
come
he
exclaimed
and
lucien
took
his
place
again
telling
himself
that
he
meant
to
try
the
effect
of
the
ad
father
he
began
after
pouring
out
with
all
the
coolness
in
the
world
a
series
of
maxims
which
the
vulgar
would
consider
profoundly
immoral
and
so
they
are
said
the
priest
that
is
why
jesus
christ
said
that
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
my
son
and
that
is
why
the
world
displays
such
horror
of
a
man
of
your
stamp
will
not
be
surprised
by
the
question
which
i
am
about
to
ask
indeed
my
son
you
do
not
know
me
said
carlos
herrera
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
engage
a
secretary
unless
i
knew
that
i
could
depend
upon
his
principles
sufficiently
to
be
sure
that
he
would
not
rob
me
i
like
you
you
are
as
innocent
in
every
way
as
a
suicide
your
question
why
do
you
take
an
interest
in
me
what
price
do
you
set
on
my
obedience
why
should
you
give
me
everything
what
is
your
share
the
spaniard
looked
at
lucien
and
a
smile
came
over
his
face
let
us
wait
till
we
come
to
the
next
hill
we
can
walk
up
and
talk
out
in
the
open
the
back
seat
of
a
traveling
carriage
is
not
the
place
for
they
traveled
in
silence
for
sometime
the
rapidity
of
the
movement
seemed
to
increase
lucien
s
moral
intoxication
here
is
a
hill
father
he
said
at
last
awakening
from
a
kind
of
dream
very
well
we
will
the
abbe
called
to
the
postilion
to
stop
and
the
two
sprang
out
upon
the
road
you
child
said
the
spaniard
taking
lucien
by
the
arm
have
you
ever
thought
over
otway
s
did
you
understand
the
profound
friendship
between
man
and
man
which
binds
pierre
and
jaffier
each
to
each
so
closely
that
a
woman
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
and
all
social
conditions
are
changed
well
so
much
for
the
so
the
canon
knows
something
of
the
drama
thought
lucien
have
you
read
voltaire
he
asked
i
have
done
better
said
the
other
i
put
his
doctrine
in
you
do
not
believe
in
god
come
it
is
i
who
am
the
atheist
is
it
the
abbe
said
smiling
let
us
come
to
practical
matters
my
child
he
added
putting
an
arm
round
lucien
s
waist
i
am
years
old
i
am
the
natural
son
of
a
great
lord
consequently
i
have
no
family
and
i
have
a
heart
but
learn
this
carve
it
on
that
still
so
soft
brain
of
yours
man
dreads
to
be
alone
and
of
all
kinds
of
isolation
inward
isolation
is
the
most
appalling
the
early
anchorite
lived
with
god
he
dwelt
in
the
spirit
world
the
most
populous
world
of
all
the
miser
lives
in
a
world
of
imagination
and
fruition
his
whole
life
and
all
that
he
is
even
his
sex
lies
in
his
brain
a
man
s
first
thought
be
he
leper
or
convict
hopelessly
sick
or
degraded
is
to
find
another
with
a
like
fate
to
share
it
with
him
he
will
exert
the
utmost
that
is
in
him
every
power
all
his
vital
energy
to
satisfy
that
craving
it
is
his
very
life
but
for
that
tyrannous
longing
would
satan
have
found
companions
there
is
a
whole
poem
yet
to
be
written
a
first
part
of
milton
s
poem
is
only
the
apology
for
the
it
would
be
the
iliad
of
corruption
said
lucien
well
i
am
alone
i
live
alone
if
i
wear
the
priest
s
habit
i
have
not
a
priest
s
heart
i
like
to
devote
myself
to
some
one
that
is
my
weakness
that
is
my
life
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
a
priest
i
am
not
afraid
of
ingratitude
and
i
am
grateful
the
church
is
nothing
to
me
it
is
an
idea
i
am
devoted
to
the
king
of
spain
but
you
can
not
give
affection
to
a
king
of
spain
he
is
my
protector
he
towers
above
me
i
want
to
love
my
creature
to
mould
him
fashion
him
to
my
use
and
love
him
as
a
father
loves
his
child
i
shall
drive
in
your
tilbury
my
boy
enjoy
your
success
with
women
and
say
to
myself
this
fine
young
fellow
this
marquis
de
rubempre
my
creation
whom
i
have
brought
into
this
great
world
is
my
very
self
his
greatness
is
my
doing
he
speaks
or
is
silent
with
my
voice
he
consults
me
in
the
abbe
de
vermont
felt
thus
for
he
led
her
to
the
he
did
not
love
the
queen
said
the
priest
he
only
loved
the
abbe
de
must
i
leave
desolation
behind
me
i
have
money
you
shall
draw
on
i
would
do
a
great
deal
just
now
to
rescue
david
sechard
said
lucien
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
given
up
all
idea
of
suicide
say
but
one
word
my
son
and
by
morning
he
shall
have
money
enough
to
set
him
what
would
you
give
me
twelve
thousand
francs
ah
child
do
you
not
see
that
we
are
traveling
on
at
the
rate
of
four
leagues
an
hour
we
shall
dine
at
poitiers
before
long
and
there
if
you
decide
to
sign
the
pact
to
give
me
a
single
proof
of
obedience
a
great
proof
that
i
shall
require
then
the
bordeaux
coach
shall
carry
fifteen
thousand
francs
to
your
sister
where
is
the
money
the
spaniard
made
no
answer
and
lucien
said
within
himself
there
i
had
him
he
was
laughing
at
in
another
moment
they
took
their
places
neither
of
them
said
a
word
silently
the
abbe
groped
in
the
pocket
of
the
coach
and
drew
out
a
traveler
s
leather
pouch
with
three
divisions
in
it
thence
he
took
a
hundred
portuguese
moidores
bringing
out
his
large
hand
filled
with
gold
three
times
father
i
am
yours
said
lucien
dazzled
by
the
stream
of
gold
child
said
the
priest
and
set
a
tender
kiss
on
lucien
s
forehead
there
is
twice
as
much
still
left
in
the
bag
besides
the
money
for
traveling
and
you
are
traveling
alone
cried
lucien
what
is
that
asked
the
spaniard
i
have
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
drafts
on
paris
a
diplomatist
without
money
is
in
your
position
of
this
morning
a
poet
without
a
will
of
his
own
as
lucien
took
his
place
in
the
caleche
beside
the
spanish
diplomatist
eve
rose
to
give
her
child
a
draught
of
milk
found
the
fatal
letter
in
the
cradle
and
read
it
a
sudden
cold
chilled
the
damps
of
morning
slumber
dizziness
came
over
her
she
could
not
see
she
called
aloud
to
marion
and
kolb
has
my
brother
gone
out
she
asked
and
kolb
answered
at
once
with
yes
montame
pefore
keep
this
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
profound
secret
said
eve
my
brother
has
gone
no
doubt
to
make
away
with
himself
hurry
both
of
you
make
inquiries
cautiously
and
look
along
the
eve
was
left
alone
in
a
dull
stupor
dreadful
to
see
her
trouble
was
at
its
height
when
came
in
at
seven
o
clock
to
talk
over
the
steps
to
be
taken
in
david
s
case
at
such
a
time
any
voice
in
the
world
may
speak
and
we
let
them
speak
our
poor
dear
david
is
in
prison
madame
so
began
i
foresaw
all
along
that
it
would
end
in
this
i
advised
him
at
the
time
to
go
into
partnership
with
his
competitors
the
cointets
for
while
your
husband
has
simply
the
idea
they
have
the
means
of
putting
it
into
practical
shape
so
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
his
arrest
yesterday
evening
what
did
i
do
but
hurry
away
to
find
the
cointets
and
try
to
obtain
such
concessions
as
might
satisfy
you
if
you
try
to
keep
the
discovery
to
yourselves
you
will
continue
to
live
a
life
of
shifts
and
chicanery
you
must
give
in
or
else
when
you
are
exhausted
and
at
the
last
gasp
you
will
end
by
making
a
bargain
with
some
capitalist
or
other
and
perhaps
to
your
own
detriment
whereas
i
hope
to
see
you
make
a
good
one
with
mm
cointet
in
this
way
you
will
save
yourselves
the
hardships
and
the
misery
of
the
inventor
s
duel
with
the
greed
of
the
capitalist
and
the
indifference
of
the
public
let
us
see
if
the
mm
cointet
should
pay
your
debts
if
over
and
above
your
debts
they
should
pay
you
a
further
sum
of
money
down
whether
or
no
the
invention
succeeds
while
at
the
same
time
it
is
thoroughly
understood
that
if
it
succeeds
a
certain
proportion
of
the
profits
of
working
the
patent
shall
be
yours
would
you
not
be
doing
very
well
you
yourself
madame
would
then
be
the
proprietor
of
the
plant
in
the
you
would
sell
the
business
no
doubt
it
is
quite
worth
twenty
thousand
francs
i
will
undertake
to
find
you
a
buyer
at
that
price
now
if
you
draw
up
a
deed
of
partnership
with
the
mm
cointet
and
receive
fifteen
thousand
francs
of
capital
and
if
you
invest
it
in
the
funds
at
the
present
moment
it
will
bring
you
in
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
you
can
live
on
two
thousand
francs
in
the
provinces
bear
in
mind
too
madame
that
given
certain
contingencies
there
will
be
yet
further
payments
i
say
contingencies
because
we
must
lay
our
accounts
with
failure
very
well
continued
now
these
things
i
am
sure
that
i
can
obtain
for
you
first
of
all
david
s
release
from
prison
secondly
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
premium
paid
on
his
discovery
whether
the
experiments
fail
or
succeed
and
lastly
a
partnership
between
david
and
the
mm
cointet
to
be
taken
out
after
private
experiment
made
jointly
the
deed
of
partnership
for
the
working
of
the
patent
should
be
drawn
up
on
the
following
basis
the
mm
cointet
to
bear
all
the
expenses
the
capital
invested
by
david
to
be
confined
to
the
expenses
of
procuring
the
patent
and
his
share
of
the
profits
to
be
fixed
at
per
cent
you
are
a
and
very
sensible
woman
qualities
which
are
not
often
found
combined
with
great
beauty
think
over
these
proposals
and
you
will
see
that
they
are
very
poor
eve
in
her
despair
burst
into
tears
ah
sir
why
did
you
not
come
yesterday
evening
to
tell
me
this
we
should
have
been
spared
disgrace
and
and
something
far
worse
i
was
talking
with
the
cointets
until
midnight
they
are
behind
metivier
as
you
must
have
suspected
but
how
has
something
worse
than
our
poor
david
s
arrest
happened
since
yesterday
evening
here
is
the
awful
news
that
i
found
when
i
awoke
this
morning
she
said
holding
out
lucien
s
letter
you
have
just
given
me
proof
of
your
interest
in
us
you
are
david
s
friend
and
lucien
s
i
need
not
ask
you
to
keep
the
secret
you
need
not
feel
the
least
anxiety
said
as
he
returned
the
letter
lucien
will
not
take
his
life
your
husband
s
arrest
was
his
doing
he
was
obliged
to
find
some
excuse
for
leaving
you
and
this
exit
of
his
looks
to
me
like
a
piece
of
stage
the
cointets
had
gained
their
ends
they
had
tormented
the
inventor
and
his
family
until
worn
out
by
the
torture
the
victims
longed
for
a
respite
and
then
seized
their
opportunity
and
made
the
offer
not
every
inventor
has
the
tenacity
of
the
that
will
perish
with
his
teeth
fast
set
in
his
capture
the
cointets
had
shrewdly
estimated
david
s
character
the
tall
cointet
looked
upon
david
s
imprisonment
as
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
of
the
drama
the
second
act
opened
with
the
proposal
which
had
just
made
as
the
attorney
looked
upon
lucien
s
frantic
folly
as
a
bit
of
luck
a
chance
that
would
finally
decide
the
issues
of
the
day
eve
was
completely
prostrated
by
this
event
saw
this
and
meant
to
profit
by
her
despair
to
win
her
confidence
for
he
saw
at
last
how
much
she
influenced
her
husband
so
far
from
discouraging
eve
he
tried
to
reassure
her
and
very
cleverly
diverted
her
thoughts
to
the
prison
she
should
persuade
david
to
take
the
cointets
into
partnership
david
told
me
madame
that
he
only
wished
for
a
fortune
for
your
sake
and
your
brother
s
but
it
should
be
clear
to
you
by
now
that
to
try
to
make
a
rich
man
of
lucien
would
be
madness
the
youngster
would
run
through
three
eve
s
attitude
told
plainly
enough
that
she
had
no
more
illusions
left
with
regard
to
her
brother
the
lawyer
waited
a
little
so
that
her
silence
should
have
the
weight
of
consent
things
being
so
it
is
now
a
question
of
you
and
your
child
he
said
it
rests
with
you
to
decide
whether
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
will
be
enough
for
your
welfare
to
say
nothing
of
old
sechard
s
property
your
s
income
has
amounted
to
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
for
a
long
time
past
to
say
nothing
of
capital
lying
out
at
interest
so
after
all
you
have
a
good
prospect
before
you
why
torment
yourself
left
eve
sechard
to
reflect
upon
this
prospect
the
whole
scheme
had
been
drawn
up
with
no
little
skill
by
the
tall
cointet
the
evening
before
give
them
the
glimpse
of
a
possibility
of
money
in
hand
the
lynx
had
said
when
brought
the
news
of
the
arrest
once
let
them
grow
accustomed
to
that
idea
and
they
are
ours
we
will
drive
a
bargain
and
little
by
little
we
shall
bring
them
down
to
our
price
for
the
the
argument
of
the
second
act
of
the
commercial
drama
was
in
a
manner
summed
up
in
that
speech
mme
sechard
heartbroken
and
full
of
dread
for
her
brother
s
fate
dressed
and
came
downstairs
an
agony
of
terror
seized
her
when
she
thought
that
she
must
cross
angouleme
alone
on
the
way
to
the
prison
gave
little
thought
to
his
fair
client
s
distress
when
he
came
back
to
offer
his
arm
it
was
from
a
tolerably
machiavellian
motive
but
eve
gave
him
credit
for
delicate
consideration
and
he
allowed
her
to
thank
him
for
it
the
little
attention
at
such
a
moment
from
so
hard
a
man
modified
mme
sechard
s
previous
opinion
of
i
am
taking
you
round
by
the
longest
way
he
said
and
we
shall
meet
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
monsieur
i
feel
that
i
have
no
right
to
hold
up
my
head
before
other
people
i
had
a
sharp
lesson
given
to
me
last
night
it
will
be
the
first
and
the
oh
i
certainly
shall
not
stay
in
the
town
now
let
me
know
if
your
husband
consents
to
the
proposals
that
are
all
but
definitely
offered
by
the
cointets
said
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
i
will
come
at
once
with
an
order
for
david
s
release
from
cachan
and
in
all
likelihood
he
will
not
go
back
again
to
this
suggestion
made
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
jail
was
a
piece
of
cunning
strategy
a
as
the
italians
call
an
indefinable
mixture
of
treachery
and
truth
a
cunningly
planned
fraud
which
does
not
break
the
letter
of
the
law
or
a
piece
of
deft
trickery
for
which
there
is
no
legal
remedy
bartholomew
s
for
instance
was
a
political
combination
imprisonment
for
debt
for
reasons
previously
explained
is
such
a
rare
occurrence
in
the
provinces
that
there
is
no
house
of
detention
and
a
debtor
is
perforce
imprisoned
with
the
accused
convicted
and
condemned
the
three
graduated
subdivisions
of
the
class
generically
styled
criminal
david
was
put
for
the
time
being
in
a
cell
on
the
ground
floor
from
which
some
prisoner
had
probably
been
recently
discharged
at
the
end
of
his
time
once
inscribed
on
the
jailer
s
register
with
the
amount
allowed
by
the
law
for
a
prisoner
s
board
for
one
month
david
confronted
a
big
stout
man
more
powerful
than
the
king
himself
in
a
prisoner
s
eyes
this
was
the
jailer
an
instance
of
a
thin
jailer
is
unknown
in
the
provinces
the
place
to
begin
with
is
almost
a
sinecure
and
a
jailer
is
a
kind
of
innkeeper
who
pays
no
rent
and
lives
very
well
while
his
prisoners
fare
very
ill
for
like
an
innkeeper
he
gives
them
rooms
according
to
their
payments
he
knew
david
by
name
and
what
was
more
knew
about
david
s
father
and
thought
that
he
might
venture
to
let
the
printer
have
a
good
room
on
credit
for
one
night
for
david
was
penniless
the
prison
of
angouleme
was
built
in
the
middle
ages
and
has
no
more
changed
than
the
old
cathedral
it
is
built
against
the
old
or
ancient
court
of
appeal
and
people
still
call
it
the
de
it
boasts
the
conventional
prison
gateway
the
door
the
low
worn
archway
which
the
better
deserves
the
qualification
cyclopean
because
the
jailer
s
peephole
or
looks
out
like
a
single
eye
from
the
front
of
the
building
as
you
enter
you
find
yourself
in
a
corridor
which
runs
across
the
entire
width
of
the
building
with
a
row
of
doors
of
cells
that
give
upon
the
prison
yard
and
are
lighted
by
high
windows
covered
with
a
square
iron
grating
the
jailer
s
house
is
separated
from
these
cells
by
an
archway
in
the
middle
through
which
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
iron
gate
of
the
prison
yard
the
jailer
installed
david
in
a
cell
next
to
the
archway
thinking
that
he
would
like
to
have
a
man
of
david
s
stamp
as
a
near
neighbor
for
the
sake
of
company
this
is
the
best
room
he
said
david
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
sight
of
it
the
stone
walls
were
tolerably
damp
the
windows
set
high
in
the
wall
were
heavily
barred
the
floor
was
cold
as
ice
and
from
the
corridor
outside
came
the
sound
of
the
measured
tramp
of
the
warder
monotonous
as
waves
on
the
beach
you
are
a
prisoner
you
are
watched
and
guarded
said
the
footsteps
at
every
moment
of
every
hour
all
these
small
things
together
produce
a
prodigious
effect
upon
the
minds
of
honest
folk
david
saw
that
the
bed
was
execrable
but
the
first
night
in
a
prison
is
full
of
violent
agitation
and
only
on
the
second
night
does
the
prisoner
notice
that
his
couch
is
hard
the
jailer
was
graciously
disposed
he
naturally
suggested
that
his
prisoner
should
walk
in
the
yard
until
nightfall
david
s
hour
of
anguish
only
began
when
he
was
locked
into
his
cell
for
the
night
lights
are
not
allowed
in
the
cells
a
prisoner
detained
on
arrest
used
to
be
subjected
to
rules
devised
for
malefactors
unless
he
brought
a
special
exemption
signed
by
the
public
prosecutor
the
jailer
certainly
might
allow
david
to
sit
by
his
fire
but
the
prisoner
must
go
back
to
his
cell
at
time
poor
david
learned
the
horrors
of
prison
life
by
experience
the
rough
coarseness
of
the
treatment
revolted
him
yet
a
revulsion
familiar
to
those
who
live
by
thought
passed
over
him
he
detached
himself
from
his
loneliness
and
found
a
way
of
escape
in
a
poet
s
waking
dream
at
last
the
unhappy
man
s
thoughts
turned
to
his
own
affairs
the
stimulating
influence
of
a
prison
upon
conscience
and
is
immense
david
asked
himself
whether
he
had
done
his
duty
as
the
head
of
a
family
what
despairing
grief
his
wife
must
feel
at
this
moment
why
had
he
not
done
as
marion
had
said
and
earned
money
enough
to
pursue
his
investigations
at
leisure
how
can
i
stay
in
angouleme
after
such
a
disgrace
and
when
i
come
out
of
prison
what
will
become
of
us
where
shall
we
go
doubts
as
to
his
process
began
to
occur
to
him
and
he
passed
through
an
agony
which
none
save
inventors
can
understand
going
from
doubt
to
doubt
david
began
to
see
his
real
position
more
clearly
and
to
himself
he
said
as
the
cointets
had
said
to
old
sechard
as
had
just
said
to
eve
suppose
that
all
should
go
well
what
does
it
amount
to
in
practice
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
take
out
a
patent
and
money
is
needed
for
that
and
experiments
must
be
tried
on
a
large
scale
in
a
which
means
that
the
discovery
must
pass
into
other
hands
oh
was
right
a
very
vivid
light
sometimes
dawns
in
the
darkest
prison
pshaw
said
david
i
shall
see
no
doubt
and
he
turned
and
slept
on
the
filthy
mattress
covered
with
coarse
brown
sacking
so
when
eve
unconsciously
played
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
that
morning
she
found
her
husband
more
than
ready
to
listen
to
proposals
she
put
her
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
for
there
was
but
one
chair
of
the
poorest
and
commonest
kind
in
the
cell
her
eyes
fell
on
the
unsightly
pail
in
a
corner
and
over
the
walls
covered
with
inscriptions
left
by
david
s
predecessors
and
tears
filled
the
eyes
that
were
red
with
weeping
she
had
sobbed
long
and
very
bitterly
but
the
sight
of
her
husband
in
a
felon
s
cell
drew
fresh
tears
and
the
desire
of
fame
may
lead
one
to
this
she
cried
oh
my
angel
give
up
your
career
let
us
walk
together
along
the
beaten
track
we
will
not
try
to
make
haste
to
be
rich
david
i
need
very
little
to
be
very
happy
especially
now
after
all
that
we
have
been
through
and
if
you
only
knew
the
disgrace
of
arrest
is
not
the
worst
she
held
out
lucien
s
letter
and
when
david
had
read
it
she
tried
to
comfort
him
by
repeating
s
bitter
comment
if
lucien
has
taken
his
life
the
thing
is
done
by
now
said
david
if
he
has
not
made
away
with
himself
by
this
time
he
will
not
kill
himself
as
he
himself
says
his
courage
can
not
last
longer
than
a
morning
but
the
suspense
cried
eve
forgiving
almost
everything
at
the
thought
of
death
then
she
told
her
husband
of
the
proposals
which
professed
to
have
received
from
the
cointets
david
accepted
them
at
once
with
manifest
pleasure
we
shall
have
enough
to
live
upon
in
a
village
near
l
houmeau
where
the
cointets
stands
i
want
nothing
now
but
a
quiet
life
said
david
if
lucien
has
punished
himself
by
death
we
can
wait
so
long
as
father
lives
and
if
lucien
is
still
living
poor
fellow
he
will
learn
to
adapt
himself
to
our
narrow
ways
the
cointets
certainly
will
make
money
by
my
discovery
but
after
all
what
am
i
compared
with
our
country
one
man
in
it
that
is
all
and
if
the
whole
country
is
benefited
i
shall
be
content
there
dear
eve
neither
you
nor
i
were
meant
to
be
successful
in
business
we
do
not
care
enough
about
making
a
profit
we
have
not
the
dogged
objection
to
parting
with
our
money
even
when
it
is
legally
owing
which
is
a
kind
of
virtue
of
the
for
these
two
sorts
of
avarice
are
called
prudence
and
a
faculty
of
eve
felt
overjoyed
she
and
her
husband
held
the
same
views
and
this
is
one
of
the
sweetest
flowers
of
love
for
two
human
beings
who
love
each
other
may
not
be
of
the
same
mind
nor
take
the
same
view
of
their
interests
she
wrote
to
telling
him
that
they
both
consented
to
the
general
scheme
and
asked
him
to
release
david
then
she
begged
the
jailer
to
deliver
the
message
ten
minutes
later
entered
the
dismal
place
go
home
madame
he
said
addressing
eve
we
will
follow
well
my
dear
friend
turning
to
david
so
you
allowed
them
to
catch
you
why
did
you
come
out
how
came
you
to
make
such
a
mistake
eh
how
could
i
do
otherwise
look
at
this
letter
that
lucien
david
held
out
a
sheet
of
paper
it
was
cerizet
s
forged
letter
read
it
looked
at
it
fingered
the
paper
as
he
talked
and
still
taking
presently
as
if
through
absence
of
mind
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
linked
his
arm
in
david
s
and
they
went
out
together
the
order
for
release
having
come
during
the
conversation
it
was
like
heaven
to
david
to
be
at
home
again
he
cried
like
a
child
when
he
took
little
lucien
in
his
arms
and
looked
round
his
room
after
three
weeks
of
imprisonment
and
the
disgrace
according
to
provincial
notions
of
the
last
few
hours
kolb
and
marion
had
come
back
marion
had
heard
in
l
houmeau
that
lucien
had
been
seen
walking
along
on
the
paris
road
somewhere
beyond
marsac
some
country
folk
coming
in
to
market
had
noticed
his
fine
clothes
kolb
therefore
had
set
out
on
horseback
along
the
highroad
and
heard
at
last
at
mansle
that
lucien
was
traveling
post
in
a
caleche
marron
had
recognized
him
as
he
passed
what
did
i
tell
you
said
that
fellow
is
not
a
poet
he
is
a
romance
in
heaven
knows
how
many
traveling
post
repeated
eve
where
can
he
be
going
this
time
now
go
to
see
the
cointets
they
are
expecting
you
said
turning
to
david
ah
monsieur
cried
the
beautiful
eve
pray
do
your
best
for
our
interests
our
whole
future
lies
in
your
if
you
prefer
it
madame
the
conference
can
be
held
here
i
will
leave
david
with
you
the
cointets
will
come
this
evening
and
you
shall
see
if
i
can
defend
your
ah
monsieur
i
should
be
very
glad
said
eve
very
well
said
this
evening
at
seven
o
thank
you
said
eve
and
from
her
tone
and
glance
knew
that
he
had
made
great
progress
in
his
fair
client
s
confidence
you
have
nothing
to
fear
you
see
i
was
right
he
added
your
brother
is
a
hundred
miles
away
from
suicide
and
when
all
comes
to
all
perhaps
you
will
have
a
little
fortune
this
evening
a
purchaser
for
the
business
has
turned
if
that
is
the
case
said
eve
why
should
we
not
wait
awhile
before
binding
ourselves
to
the
cointets
saw
the
danger
you
are
forgetting
madame
he
said
that
you
can
not
sell
your
business
until
you
have
paid
metivier
for
a
distress
warrant
has
been
as
soon
as
reached
home
he
sent
for
cerizet
and
when
the
printer
s
foreman
appeared
drew
him
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
evening
he
said
you
will
be
the
proprietor
of
the
sechards
and
then
there
are
those
behind
you
who
have
influence
enough
to
transfer
the
license
then
in
a
lowered
voice
but
you
have
no
mind
to
end
in
the
hulks
i
suppose
the
hulks
what
s
that
what
s
that
your
letter
to
david
was
a
forgery
it
is
in
my
possession
what
would
henriette
say
in
a
court
of
law
i
do
not
want
to
ruin
you
he
added
hastily
seeing
how
white
cerizet
s
face
grew
you
want
something
more
of
me
cried
cerizet
well
here
it
is
said
follow
me
carefully
you
will
be
a
master
printer
in
angouleme
in
two
months
time
but
you
will
not
have
paid
for
your
business
you
will
not
pay
for
it
in
ten
years
you
will
work
a
long
while
yet
for
those
that
have
lent
you
the
money
and
you
will
be
the
cat
of
the
liberal
party
now
shall
draw
up
your
agreement
with
gannerac
and
i
can
draw
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
you
will
have
the
business
in
your
own
hands
one
of
these
days
but
if
the
liberals
start
a
paper
if
you
bring
it
out
and
if
i
am
deputy
public
prosecutor
then
you
will
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
cointets
and
publish
articles
of
such
a
nature
that
they
will
have
the
paper
suppressed
the
cointets
will
pay
you
handsomely
for
that
service
i
know
of
course
that
you
will
be
a
hero
a
victim
of
persecution
you
will
be
a
personage
among
the
liberals
a
sergeant
mercier
a
courier
a
manual
on
a
small
scale
i
will
take
care
that
they
leave
you
your
license
in
fact
on
the
day
when
the
newspaper
is
suppressed
i
will
burn
this
letter
before
your
eyes
your
fortune
will
not
cost
you
a
working
man
has
the
haziest
notions
as
to
the
law
with
regard
to
forgery
and
cerizet
who
beheld
himself
already
in
the
dock
breathed
again
in
three
years
time
continued
i
shall
be
public
prosecutor
in
angouleme
you
may
have
need
of
me
some
day
bear
that
in
it
s
agreed
said
cerizet
but
you
don
t
know
me
burn
that
letter
now
and
trust
to
my
looked
cerizet
in
the
face
it
was
a
duel
in
which
one
man
s
gaze
is
a
scalpel
with
which
he
essays
to
probe
the
soul
of
another
and
the
eyes
of
that
other
are
a
theatre
as
it
were
to
which
all
his
virtue
is
summoned
for
display
did
not
utter
a
word
he
lighted
a
taper
and
burned
the
letter
he
has
his
way
to
make
he
said
to
himself
here
is
one
that
will
go
through
fire
and
water
for
you
said
cerizet
david
awaited
the
interview
with
the
cointets
with
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
not
however
on
account
of
the
proposed
partnership
nor
for
his
own
interests
he
felt
nervous
as
to
their
opinion
of
his
work
he
was
in
something
the
same
position
as
a
dramatic
author
before
his
judges
the
inventor
s
pride
in
the
discovery
so
nearly
completed
left
no
room
for
any
other
feelings
at
seven
o
clock
that
evening
while
mme
du
chatelet
pleading
a
sick
headache
had
gone
to
her
room
in
her
unhappiness
over
the
rumors
of
lucien
s
departure
while
de
comte
left
to
himself
was
entertaining
his
guests
at
dinner
the
tall
cointet
and
his
stout
brother
accompanied
by
opened
negotiations
with
the
competitor
who
had
delivered
himself
up
bound
hand
and
foot
a
difficulty
awaited
them
at
the
outset
how
was
it
possible
to
draw
up
a
deed
of
partnership
unless
they
knew
david
s
secret
and
if
david
divulged
his
secret
he
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
cointets
arranged
that
the
deed
of
partnership
should
be
the
first
drawn
up
thereupon
the
tall
cointet
asked
to
see
some
specimens
of
david
s
work
and
david
brought
out
the
last
sheet
that
he
had
made
guaranteeing
the
price
of
production
well
said
there
you
have
the
basis
of
the
agreement
ready
made
you
can
go
into
partnership
on
the
strength
of
those
samples
inserting
a
clause
to
protect
yourselves
in
case
the
conditions
of
the
patent
are
not
fulfilled
in
the
manufacturing
it
is
one
thing
to
make
samples
of
paper
on
a
small
scale
in
your
own
room
with
a
small
mould
monsieur
and
another
to
turn
out
a
quantity
said
the
tall
cointet
addressing
david
quite
another
thing
as
you
may
judge
from
this
single
fact
we
manufacture
colored
papers
we
buy
parcels
of
coloring
absolutely
identical
every
cake
of
indigo
used
for
blueing
our
is
taken
from
a
batch
supplied
by
the
same
maker
well
we
have
never
yet
been
able
to
obtain
two
batches
of
precisely
the
same
shade
there
are
variations
in
the
material
which
we
can
not
detect
the
quantity
and
the
quality
of
the
pulp
modify
every
question
at
once
suppose
that
you
have
in
a
caldron
a
quantity
of
ingredients
of
some
kind
i
don
t
ask
to
know
what
they
are
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
them
the
treatment
can
be
uniformly
applied
you
can
manipulate
knead
and
pestle
the
mass
at
your
pleasure
until
you
have
a
homogeneous
substance
but
who
will
guarantee
that
it
will
be
the
same
with
a
batch
of
five
hundred
reams
and
that
your
plan
will
succeed
in
bulk
david
eve
and
looked
at
one
another
their
eyes
said
many
things
take
a
somewhat
similar
case
continued
the
tall
cointet
after
a
pause
you
cut
two
or
three
trusses
of
meadow
hay
and
store
it
in
a
loft
before
the
heat
is
out
of
the
grass
as
the
peasants
say
the
hay
ferments
but
no
harm
comes
of
it
you
follow
up
your
experiment
by
storing
a
couple
of
thousand
trusses
in
a
wooden
barn
and
of
course
the
hay
smoulders
and
the
barn
blazes
up
like
a
lighted
match
you
are
an
educated
man
continued
cointet
you
can
see
the
application
for
yourself
so
far
you
have
only
cut
your
two
trusses
of
hay
we
are
afraid
of
setting
fire
to
our
by
bringing
in
a
couple
of
thousand
trusses
in
other
words
we
may
spoil
more
than
one
batch
make
heavy
losses
and
find
ourselves
none
the
better
for
laying
out
a
good
deal
of
david
was
completely
floored
by
this
reasoning
practical
wisdom
spoke
in
language
to
theory
whose
word
is
always
for
the
future
devil
fetch
me
if
i
ll
sign
such
a
deed
of
partnership
the
stout
cointet
cried
bluntly
you
may
throw
away
your
money
if
you
like
boniface
as
for
me
i
shall
keep
mine
here
is
my
offer
to
pay
sechard
s
debts
six
thousand
francs
and
another
three
thousand
francs
in
bills
at
twelve
and
fifteen
months
he
added
that
will
be
quite
enough
risk
to
we
have
a
balance
of
twelve
thousand
francs
against
metivier
that
will
make
fifteen
thousand
that
is
all
that
i
would
pay
for
the
secret
if
i
were
going
to
exploit
it
for
myself
so
this
is
the
great
discovery
that
you
were
talking
about
boniface
many
thanks
i
thought
you
had
more
sense
no
you
can
t
call
this
the
question
for
you
said
undismayed
by
the
explosion
resolves
itself
into
this
do
you
care
to
risk
twenty
thousand
francs
to
buy
a
secret
that
may
make
rich
men
of
you
why
the
risk
usually
is
in
proportion
to
the
profit
gentlemen
you
stake
twenty
thousand
francs
on
your
luck
a
gambler
puts
down
a
louis
at
roulette
for
a
chance
of
winning
but
he
knows
that
the
louis
is
lost
do
the
i
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
said
the
stout
cointet
i
am
not
so
clever
as
my
brother
i
am
a
plain
sort
of
chap
that
only
knows
one
thing
how
to
print
at
twenty
sous
and
sell
them
for
two
francs
where
i
see
an
invention
that
has
only
been
tried
once
i
see
ruin
you
succeed
with
the
first
batch
you
spoil
the
next
you
go
on
and
you
are
drawn
in
for
once
put
an
arm
into
that
machinery
the
rest
of
you
follows
and
he
related
an
anecdote
very
much
to
the
point
how
a
bordeaux
merchant
had
ruined
himself
by
following
a
scientific
man
s
advice
and
trying
to
bring
the
landes
into
cultivation
and
followed
up
the
tale
with
similar
instances
of
agricultural
and
commercial
failures
nearer
home
in
the
departments
of
the
charente
and
dordogne
he
waxed
warm
over
his
recitals
he
would
not
listen
to
another
word
s
demurs
so
far
from
soothing
the
stout
cointet
appeared
to
irritate
him
i
would
rather
give
more
for
a
certainty
if
i
made
only
a
small
profit
on
it
he
said
looking
at
his
brother
it
is
my
opinion
that
things
have
gone
far
enough
for
business
he
concluded
still
you
came
here
for
something
didn
t
you
asked
what
is
your
offer
i
offer
to
release
sechard
and
if
his
plan
succeeds
to
give
him
thirty
per
cent
of
the
profits
the
stout
cointet
answered
briskly
but
monsieur
objected
eve
how
should
we
live
while
the
experiments
were
being
made
my
husband
has
endured
the
disgrace
of
imprisonment
already
he
may
as
well
go
back
to
prison
it
makes
no
difference
now
and
we
will
pay
our
debts
ourselves
laid
a
finger
on
his
lips
in
warning
you
are
unreasonable
said
he
addressing
the
brothers
you
have
seen
the
paper
sechard
s
father
told
you
that
he
had
shut
his
son
up
and
that
he
had
made
capital
paper
in
a
single
night
from
materials
that
must
have
cost
a
mere
nothing
you
are
here
to
make
an
offer
are
you
purchasers
yes
or
no
stay
said
the
tall
cointet
whether
my
brother
is
willing
or
no
i
will
risk
this
much
myself
i
will
pay
sechard
s
debts
i
will
pay
six
thousand
francs
over
and
above
the
debts
and
sechard
shall
have
thirty
per
cent
of
the
profits
but
mind
this
if
in
the
space
of
one
year
he
fails
to
carry
out
the
undertakings
which
he
himself
will
make
in
the
deed
of
partnership
he
must
return
the
six
thousand
francs
and
we
shall
keep
the
patent
and
extricate
ourselves
as
best
we
are
you
sure
of
yourself
asked
taking
david
aside
yes
said
david
he
was
deceived
by
the
tactics
of
the
brothers
and
afraid
lest
the
stout
cointet
should
break
off
the
negotiations
on
which
his
future
depended
very
well
i
will
draft
the
deed
said
addressing
the
rest
of
the
party
each
of
you
shall
have
a
copy
and
you
will
have
all
morning
in
which
to
think
it
over
afternoon
at
four
o
clock
when
the
court
rises
you
will
sign
the
agreement
you
gentlemen
will
withdraw
metivier
s
suit
and
i
for
my
part
will
write
to
stop
proceedings
in
the
we
will
give
notice
on
either
side
that
the
affair
has
been
settled
out
of
david
sechard
s
undertakings
were
thus
worded
in
the
deed
m
david
sechard
printer
of
angouleme
affirming
that
he
has
discovered
a
method
of
sizing
in
the
vat
and
also
a
method
of
affecting
a
reduction
of
fifty
per
cent
in
the
price
of
all
kinds
of
manufactured
papers
by
introducing
certain
vegetable
substances
into
the
pulp
either
by
intermixture
of
such
substances
with
the
rags
already
in
use
or
by
employing
them
solely
without
the
addition
of
rags
a
partnership
for
working
the
patent
to
be
presently
applied
for
is
entered
upon
by
david
sechard
and
the
firm
of
cointet
brothers
subject
to
the
following
conditional
clauses
and
one
of
the
clauses
so
drafted
that
david
sechard
forfeited
all
his
rights
if
he
failed
to
fulfil
his
engagements
within
the
year
the
tall
cointet
was
particularly
careful
to
insert
that
clause
and
david
sechard
allowed
it
to
pass
when
appeared
with
a
copy
of
the
agreement
next
morning
at
seven
o
clock
he
brought
news
for
david
and
his
wife
cerizet
offered
thousand
francs
for
the
business
the
whole
affair
could
be
signed
and
settled
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
if
the
cointets
knew
about
it
he
added
they
would
be
quite
capable
of
refusing
to
sign
the
deed
of
partnership
of
harassing
you
and
selling
you
are
you
sure
of
payment
asked
eve
she
had
thought
it
hopeless
to
try
to
sell
the
business
and
now
to
her
astonishment
a
bargain
which
would
have
been
their
salvation
three
months
ago
was
concluded
in
this
summary
fashion
the
money
has
been
deposited
with
me
he
answered
succinctly
why
here
is
magic
at
work
said
david
and
he
asked
for
an
explanation
of
this
piece
of
luck
no
said
it
is
very
simple
the
merchants
in
l
houmeau
want
a
but
i
am
bound
not
to
publish
a
paper
said
david
yes
you
are
bound
but
is
your
successor
however
it
is
he
continued
do
not
trouble
yourself
at
all
sell
the
business
pocket
the
proceeds
and
leave
cerizet
to
find
his
way
through
the
conditions
of
the
sale
he
can
take
care
of
yes
said
eve
and
if
it
turns
out
that
you
may
not
print
a
newspaper
in
angouleme
said
those
who
are
finding
the
capital
for
cerizet
will
bring
out
the
paper
in
l
the
prospect
of
thousand
francs
of
want
now
at
end
dazzled
eve
the
partnership
and
its
hopes
took
a
second
place
and
therefore
and
mme
sechard
gave
way
on
a
final
point
of
dispute
the
tall
cointet
insisted
that
the
patent
should
be
taken
out
in
the
name
of
any
one
of
the
partners
what
difference
could
it
make
the
stout
cointet
said
the
last
word
he
is
finding
the
money
for
the
patent
he
is
bearing
the
expenses
of
the
journey
another
two
thousand
francs
over
and
above
the
rest
of
the
expenses
he
must
take
it
out
in
his
own
name
or
we
will
not
stir
in
the
the
lynx
gained
a
victory
at
all
points
the
deed
of
partnership
was
signed
that
afternoon
at
four
the
tall
cointet
politely
gave
mme
sechard
a
dozen
forks
and
spoons
and
a
beautiful
ternaux
shawl
by
way
of
said
he
and
to
efface
any
unpleasant
impression
made
in
the
heat
of
discussion
the
copies
of
the
draft
had
scarcely
been
made
out
cachan
had
barely
had
time
to
send
the
documents
to
together
with
the
three
unlucky
forged
bills
when
the
sechards
heard
a
deafening
rumble
in
the
street
a
dray
from
the
messageries
stopped
before
the
door
and
kolb

voice
made

david
will
be
released
and
with
the
four
thousand
francs
he
can
buy
a
little
no
doubt
and
make
his
fortune
forget
me
all
of
you
this
is
the
wish
of
your
unhappy
brother
it
is
decreed
that
my
poor
boy
should
be
unlucky
in
everything
and
even
when
he
does
well
as
he
said
himself
said
mme
chardon
as
she
watched
the
men
piling
up
the
bags
we
have
had
a
narrow
escape
exclaimed
the
tall
cointet
when
he
was
once
more
in
the
place
du
murier
an
hour
later
the
glitter
of
the
silver
would
have
thrown
a
new
light
on
the
deed
of
partnership
our
man
would
have
fought
shy
of
it
we
have
his
promise
now
and
in
three
months
time
we
shall
know
what
to
that
very
evening
at
seven
o
clock
cerizet
bought
the
business
and
the
money
was
paid
over
the
purchaser
undertaking
to
pay
rent
for
the
last
quarter
the
next
day
eve
sent
forty
thousand
francs
to
the
and
bought
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
of
in
her
husband
s
name
then
she
wrote
to
her
and
asked
him
to
find
a
small
farm
worth
about
ten
thousand
francs
for
her
near
marsac
she
meant
to
invest
her
own
fortune
in
this
way
the
tall
cointet
s
plot
was
formidably
simple
from
the
very
first
he
considered
that
the
plan
of
sizing
the
pulp
in
the
vat
was
impracticable
the
real
secret
of
fortune
lay
in
the
composition
of
the
pulp
in
the
cheap
vegetable
fibre
as
a
substitute
for
rags
he
made
up
his
mind
therefore
to
lay
immense
stress
on
the
secondary
problem
of
sizing
the
pulp
and
to
pass
over
the
discovery
of
cheap
raw
material
and
for
the
following
reasons
the
angouleme
manufacture
paper
for
stationers
notepaper
foolscap
crown
and
are
all
necessarily
sized
and
these
papers
have
been
the
pride
of
the
angouleme
mills
for
a
long
while
past
stationery
being
the
specialty
of
the
charente
this
fact
gave
color
to
the
cointet
s
urgency
upon
the
point
of
sizing
in
the
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
cared
nothing
for
this
part
of
david
s
researches
the
demand
for
is
exceedingly
small
compared
with
the
almost
unlimited
demand
for
unsized
paper
for
printers
as
boniface
cointet
traveled
to
paris
to
take
out
the
patent
in
his
own
name
he
was
projecting
plans
that
were
like
to
work
a
revolution
in
his
arrived
in
paris
he
took
up
his
quarters
with
metivier
and
gave
his
instructions
to
his
agent
metivier
was
to
call
upon
the
proprietors
of
newspapers
and
offer
to
deliver
paper
at
prices
below
those
quoted
by
all
other
houses
he
could
guarantee
in
each
case
that
the
paper
should
be
a
better
color
and
in
every
way
superior
to
the
best
kinds
hitherto
in
use
newspapers
are
always
supplied
by
contract
there
would
be
time
before
the
present
contracts
expired
to
complete
all
the
subterranean
operations
with
buyers
and
to
obtain
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
cointet
calculated
that
he
could
rid
himself
of
sechard
while
metivier
was
taking
orders
from
the
principal
paris
newspapers
which
even
then
consumed
two
hundred
reams
daily
cointet
naturally
offered
metivier
a
large
commission
on
the
contracts
for
he
wished
to
secure
a
clever
representative
on
the
spot
and
to
waste
no
time
in
traveling
to
and
fro
and
in
this
manner
the
fortunes
of
the
firm
of
metivier
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
the
paper
trade
were
founded
the
tall
cointet
went
back
to
angouleme
to
be
present
at
s
wedding
with
a
mind
at
rest
as
to
the
future
had
sold
his
professional
connection
and
was
only
waiting
for
milaud
s
promotion
to
take
the
public
prosecutor
s
place
which
had
been
promised
to
him
by
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
the
public
prosecutor
s
second
deputy
was
appointed
first
deputy
to
the
court
of
limoges
the
keeper
of
the
seals
sent
a
man
of
his
own
to
angouleme
and
the
post
of
first
deputy
was
kept
vacant
for
a
couple
of
months
the
interval
was
s
honeymoon
while
boniface
cointet
was
in
paris
david
made
a
first
experimental
batch
of
unsized
paper
far
superior
to
that
in
common
use
for
newspapers
he
followed
it
up
with
a
second
batch
of
magnificent
vellum
paper
for
fine
printing
and
this
the
cointets
used
for
a
new
edition
of
their
diocesan
the
material
had
been
privately
prepared
by
david
himself
he
would
have
no
helpers
but
kolb
and
marion
when
boniface
came
back
the
whole
affair
wore
a
different
aspect
he
looked
at
the
samples
and
was
fairly
satisfied
my
good
friend
he
said
the
whole
trade
of
angouleme
is
in
crown
paper
we
must
make
the
best
possible
crown
paper
at
half
the
present
price
that
is
the
first
and
foremost
question
for
then
david
tried
to
size
the
pulp
for
the
desired
paper
and
the
result
was
a
harsh
surface
with
grains
of
size
distributed
all
over
it
on
the
day
when
the
experiment
was
concluded
and
david
held
the
sheets
in
his
hand
he
went
away
to
find
a
spot
where
he
could
be
alone
and
swallow
his
bitter
disappointment
but
boniface
cointet
went
in
search
of
him
and
comforted
him
boniface
was
delightfully
amiable
do
not
lose
heart
he
said
go
on
i
am
a
good
fellow
i
understand
you
i
will
stand
by
you
to
the
really
david
said
to
his
wife
at
dinner
we
are
with
good
people
i
should
not
have
expected
that
the
tall
cointet
would
be
so
and
he
repeated
his
conversation
with
his
wily
partner
three
months
were
spent
in
experiments
david
slept
at
the
mill
he
noted
the
effects
of
various
preparations
upon
the
pulp
at
one
time
he
attributed
his
to
an
admixture
of
with
his
own
ingredients
and
made
a
batch
entirely
composed
of
the
new
material
at
another
he
endeavored
to
size
pulp
made
exclusively
from
rags
persevering
in
his
experiments
under
the
eyes
of
the
tall
cointet
whom
he
had
ceased
to
mistrust
until
he
had
tried
every
possible
combination
of
pulp
and
size
david
lived
in
the
for
the
first
six
months
of
if
it
can
be
called
living
to
leave
food
untasted
and
go
in
neglect
of
person
and
dress
he
wrestled
so
desperately
with
the
difficulties
that
anybody
but
the
cointets
would
have
seen
the
sublimity
of
the
struggle
for
the
brave
fellow
was
not
thinking
of
his
own
interests
the
moment
had
come
when
he
cared
for
nothing
but
the
victory
with
marvelous
sagacity
he
watched
the
unaccountable
freaks
of
the
substances
called
into
existence
by
man
for
ends
of
his
own
substances
in
which
nature
had
been
tamed
as
it
were
and
her
tacit
resistance
overcome
and
from
these
observations
drew
great
conclusions
finding
as
he
did
that
such
creations
can
only
be
obtained
by
following
the
laws
of
the
more
remote
affinities
of
things
of
a
second
nature
as
he
called
it
in
substances
towards
the
end
of
august
he
succeeded
to
some
extent
in
sizing
the
paper
pulp
in
the
vat
the
result
being
a
kind
of
paper
identical
with
a
make
in
use
for
printers
proofs
at
the
present
day
a
kind
of
paper
that
can
not
be
depended
upon
for
the
sizing
itself
is
not
always
certain
this
was
a
great
result
considering
the
condition
of
the
paper
trade
in
and
david
hoped
to
solve
the
final
difficulties
of
the
problem
but
it
had
cost
ten
thousand
francs
singular
rumors
were
current
at
this
time
in
angouleme
and
l
houmeau
it
was
said
that
david
sechard
was
ruining
the
firm
of
cointet
brothers
experiments
had
eaten
up
twenty
thousand
francs
and
the
result
said
gossip
was
wretchedly
bad
paper
other
manufacturers
took
fright
at
this
hugged
themselves
on
their
methods
and
being
jealous
of
the
cointets
spread
rumors
of
the
approaching
fall
of
that
ambitious
house
as
for
the
tall
cointet
he
set
up
the
new
machinery
for
making
lengths
of
paper
in
a
ribbon
and
allowed
people
to
believe
that
he
was
buying
plant
for
david
s
experiments
then
the
cunning
cointet
used
david
s
formula
for
pulp
while
urging
his
partner
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
sizing
process
and
thousands
of
reams
of
the
new
paper
were
despatched
to
metivier
in
paris
when
september
arrived
the
tall
cointet
took
david
aside
and
learning
that
the
latter
meditated
a
crowning
experiment
dissuaded
him
from
further
attempts
go
to
marsac
my
dear
david
see
your
wife
and
take
a
rest
after
your
labors
we
don
t
want
to
ruin
ourselves
said
cointet
in
the
friendliest
way
this
great
triumph
of
yours
after
all
is
only
a
we
shall
wait
now
for
awhile
before
trying
any
new
experiments
to
be
fair
see
what
has
come
of
them
we
are
not
merely
we
are
printers
besides
and
bankers
and
people
say
that
you
are
ruining
david
sechard
s
gesture
of
protest
on
behalf
of
his
good
faith
was
sublime
in
its
simplicity
not
that
fifty
thousand
francs
thrown
into
the
charente
would
ruin
us
said
cointet
in
reply
to
mute
protest
but
we
do
not
wish
to
be
obliged
to
pay
cash
for
everything
in
consequence
of
slanders
that
shake
our
credit
would
bring
us
to
a
standstill
we
have
reached
the
term
fixed
by
our
agreement
and
we
are
bound
on
either
side
to
think
over
our
he
is
right
thought
david
he
had
forgotten
the
routine
work
of
the
business
thoroughly
absorbed
as
he
had
been
in
experiments
on
a
large
scale
david
went
to
marsac
for
the
past
six
months
he
had
gone
over
on
saturday
evening
returning
again
to
l
houmeau
on
tuesday
morning
eve
after
much
counsel
from
her
had
bought
a
house
called
the
verberie
with
three
acres
of
land
and
a
croft
planted
with
vines
which
lay
like
a
wedge
in
the
old
man
s
vineyard
here
with
her
mother
and
marion
she
lived
a
very
frugal
life
for
five
thousand
francs
of
the
purchase
money
still
remained
unpaid
it
was
a
charming
little
domain
the
prettiest
bit
of
property
in
marsac
the
house
with
a
garden
before
it
and
a
yard
at
the
back
was
built
of
white
tufa
ornamented
with
carvings
cut
without
great
expense
in
that
easily
wrought
stone
and
roofed
with
slate
the
pretty
furniture
from
the
house
in
angouleme
looked
prettier
still
at
marsac
for
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
at
comfort
or
luxury
in
the
country
in
those
days
a
row
of
pomegranates
and
rare
plants
stood
before
the
house
on
the
side
of
the
garden
set
there
by
the
last
owner
an
old
general
who
died
under
marron
s
hands
david
was
enjoying
his
holiday
sitting
under
an
with
his
wife
and
father
and
little
lucien
when
the
bailiff
from
mansle
appeared
cointet
brothers
gave
their
partner
formal
notice
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
disputes
in
accordance
with
a
clause
in
the
agreement
the
cointets
demanded
that
the
six
thousand
francs
should
be
refunded
and
the
patent
surrendered
in
consideration
of
the
enormous
outlay
made
to
no
purpose
people
say
that
you
are
ruining
them
said
old
sechard
well
well
of
all
that
you
have
done
that
is
the
one
thing
that
i
am
glad
to
at
nine
o
clock
the
next
morning
eve
and
david
stood
in
s
the
little
lawyer
was
the
guardian
of
the
widow
and
orphan
by
virtue
of
his
office
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
could
take
no
other
advice
was
delighted
to
see
his
clients
and
insisted
that
and
mme
sechard
should
do
him
the
pleasure
of
breakfasting
with
him
do
the
cointets
want
six
thousand
francs
of
you
he
asked
smiling
how
much
is
still
owing
of
the
of
the
verberie
five
thousand
francs
monsieur
said
eve
but
i
have
two
thousand
keep
your
money
broke
in
let
us
see
five
thousand
why
you
want
quite
another
ten
thousand
francs
to
settle
yourselves
comfortably
down
yonder
very
good
in
two
hours
time
the
cointets
shall
bring
you
fifteen
thousand
francs
eve
started
with
surprise
if
you
will
renounce
all
claims
to
the
profits
under
the
deed
of
partnership
and
come
to
an
amicable
settlement
said
does
that
suit
you
will
it
really
be
lawfully
ours
asked
eve
very
much
so
said
the
lawyer
smiling
the
cointets
have
worked
you
trouble
enough
i
should
like
to
make
an
end
of
their
pretensions
listen
to
me
i
am
a
magistrate
now
and
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
the
truth
very
good
the
cointets
are
playing
you
false
at
this
moment
but
you
are
in
their
hands
if
you
accept
battle
you
might
possibly
gain
the
lawsuit
which
they
will
bring
do
you
wish
to
be
where
you
are
now
after
ten
years
of
litigation
experts
fees
and
expenses
of
arbitration
will
be
multiplied
the
most
contradictory
opinions
will
be
given
and
you
must
take
your
chance
and
he
added
smiling
again
there
is
no
attorney
here
that
can
defend
you
so
far
as
i
see
my
successor
has
not
much
ability
there
a
bad
compromise
is
better
than
a
successful
any
arrangement
that
will
give
us
a
quiet
life
will
do
for
me
said
david
called
to
his
servant
paul
go
and
ask
segaud
my
successor
to
come
he
shall
go
to
see
the
cointets
while
we
breakfast
said
addressing
his
former
clients
and
in
a
few
hours
time
you
will
be
on
your
way
home
to
marsac
ruined
but
with
minds
at
rest
ten
thousand
francs
will
bring
you
in
another
five
hundred
francs
of
income
and
you
will
live
comfortably
on
your
bit
of
two
hours
later
as
had
prophesied
maitre
segaud
came
back
with
an
agreement
duly
drawn
up
and
signed
by
the
cointets
and
fifteen
notes
each
for
a
thousand
francs
we
are
much
indebted
to
you
said
sechard
turning
to
why
i
have
just
this
moment
ruined
you
said
looking
at
his
astonished
former
clients
i
tell
you
again
i
have
ruined
you
as
you
will
see
as
time
goes
on
but
i
know
you
you
would
rather
be
ruined
than
wait
for
a
fortune
which
perhaps
might
come
too
we
are
not
mercenary
monsieur
said
madame
eve
we
thank
you
for
giving
us
the
means
of
happiness
we
shall
always
feel
grateful
to
great
heavens
don
t
call
down
blessings
on
cried
it
fills
me
with
remorse
but
i
think
i
have
made
full
reparation
if
i
am
a
magistrate
it
is
entirely
owing
to
you
and
if
anybody
is
to
feel
grateful
it
is
as
time
went
on
kolb
changed
his
opinion
of
sechard
senior
and
as
for
the
old
man
he
took
a
liking
to
kolb
when
he
found
that
like
himself
the
alsacien
could
neither
write
nor
read
a
word
and
that
it
was
easy
to
make
him
tipsy
the
old
bear
imparted
his
ideas
on
vine
culture
and
the
sale
of
a
vintage
to
the
and
trained
him
with
a
view
to
leaving
a
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
to
look
after
his
children
when
he
should
be
gone
for
he
grew
childish
at
the
last
and
great
were
his
fears
as
to
the
fate
of
his
property
he
had
chosen
courtois
the
miller
as
his
confidant
you
will
see
how
things
will
go
with
my
children
when
i
am
under
ground
lord
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
old
sechard
died
in
the
month
of
march
leaving
about
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
land
his
acres
added
to
the
verberie
made
a
fine
property
which
kolb
had
managed
to
admiration
for
some
two
years
david
and
his
wife
found
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
gold
in
the
house
the
department
of
the
charente
had
valued
old
sechard
s
money
at
a
million
rumor
as
usual
exaggerating
the
amount
of
a
hoard
eve
and
david
had
barely
thirty
thousand
francs
of
income
when
they
added
their
little
fortune
to
the
inheritance
they
waited
awhile
and
so
it
fell
out
that
they
invested
their
capital
in
government
securities
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
of
july
then
and
not
until
then
could
the
department
of
the
charente
and
david
sechard
form
some
idea
of
the
wealth
of
the
tall
cointet
rich
to
the
extent
of
several
millions
of
francs
the
elder
cointet
became
a
deputy
and
is
at
this
day
a
peer
of
france
it
is
said
that
he
will
be
minister
of
commerce
in
the
next
government
for
in
he
married
mlle
popinot
daughter
of
anselme
popinot
one
of
the
most
influential
statesmen
of
the
dynasty
deputy
and
mayor
of
an
arrondissement
in
paris
david
sechard
s
discovery
has
been
assimilated
by
the
french
manufacturing
world
as
food
is
assimilated
by
a
living
body
thanks
to
the
introduction
of
materials
other
than
rags
france
can
produce
paper
more
cheaply
than
any
other
european
country
dutch
paper
as
david
foresaw
no
longer
exists
sooner
or
later
it
will
be
necessary
no
doubt
to
establish
a
royal
paper
manufactory
like
the
gobelins
the
sevres
porcelain
works
the
savonnerie
and
the
imprimerie
royale
which
so
far
have
escaped
the
destruction
threatened
by
vandalism
david
sechard
beloved
by
his
wife
father
of
two
boys
and
a
girl
has
the
good
taste
to
make
no
allusion
to
his
past
efforts
eve
had
the
sense
to
dissuade
him
from
following
his
terrible
vocation
for
the
inventor
like
moses
on
mount
horeb
is
consumed
by
the
burning
bush
he
cultivates
literature
by
way
of
recreation
and
leads
a
comfortable
life
of
leisure
befitting
the
landowner
who
lives
on
his
own
estate
he
has
bidden
farewell
for
ever
to
glory
and
bravely
taken
his
place
in
the
class
of
dreamers
and
collectors
for
he
dabbles
in
entomology
and
is
at
present
investigating
the
transformations
of
insects
which
science
only
knows
in
the
final
stage
everybody
has
heard
of
s
success
as
he
is
the
rival
of
the
great
vinet
of
provins
and
it
is
his
ambition
to
be
president
of
the
of
poitiers
cerizet
has
been
in
trouble
so
frequently
for
political
offences
that
he
has
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
and
as
one
of
the
boldest
of
the
liberal
party
he
was
nicknamed
the
brave
when
s
successor
compelled
him
to
sell
his
business
in
angouleme
he
found
a
fresh
career
on
the
provincial
stage
where
his
talents
as
an
actor
were
like
to
be
turned
to
brilliant
account
the
chief
stage
heroine
however
obliged
him
to
go
to
paris
to
find
a
cure
for
love
among
the
resources
of
science
and
there
he
tried
to
curry
favor
with
the
liberal
party
as
for
lucien
the

of
his
return

paris
